Andy,
     Just got the news from NYU.  Tough choice between me and Roy Pea:
they picked the wrong guy.  They'll get what they deserve.
     Personally, I'm relieved.  I can face unemployment easier than
I could face taking my two young daughters to live in Greenwich
Village.
     I'm still waiting and hoping to hear good news from Michigan.
Bob

Subject: Michigan rejection for Lawler

Andy,

     This Saturday, I received the following from Robert Kozma, Chair
of the Search Committe for the Michigan School of Education:

     "The Instructional Technology Search Committee discussed your
candidacy in our meeting today.  Although we were quite impressed by your
credentials, there were several people within and outside the committee
who have serious reservations about your ability to help us build our
program.  These reservations have not subsided over the last months.
Given this, we have concluded that we can not make a strong enough case
to move your application forward to the Executive Committee.
     It was a pleasure meeting you and learning of your work. Best
wishes in your career."

     The above letter represents for me a serious setback and a grave
disappointment.  The possible Michigan position was the only permanent
academic opening for which I had any hope before September 1987.  More
importantly, I really wanted that position, for in my understanding they
sought someone who could provide leadership and initive in instructional
technology and also create and develop a liason with the Cognitive Science
and AI communities in anticipation of their future impact on education.
In my understanding of the position as described to me, I was their ideal
candidate.  The presentation I made at Michigan was the second best I've
made in  my life; the senior faculty member of the search committee told
me after that he judged my presentation "truly remarkable".  In personal
meetings, I believe I made no faux pas so serious as to alienate any members
of the committee.  I made a strong, very positive impression on several.
Why, then, did I fail to receive an offer ?

     There are two sorts of reasons.  In the first place, Michigan's Ed
School has just completed a 40% reduction in force.  The administration
is very nervous about their FIRST request for a new position since the
highly critical report which led to the decimation of their faculty.
They believe that their future credibility will depend upon the quality
of the first candidate they propose.  In respect of my "inadequacies"
as a candidate, I heard in telephone conversations with Bob Kozma that
the following reasons were foremost in the committee's negative decision:
  - The general opinion was that I had insufficient experience with
     traditional K-12 education to lead an initiative for the integration
     of instructional technology into that curriculum. (My half year
     teaching English in grades 7, 9, 10, and 11 was too shallow and
     narrow -- a fair judgment, given the criterion of "integration").
  - There was a strong minority opinion that my personal style was not what
     they sought.  More explicitly, they were looking for a person who
     would be more a "team builder" and less a superstar.
  - Finally, they felt that they could not compete, financially, with the
     salary I have been receiving at my present job.  Entering the school
     with a salary equivalent to 9 months of my current income, I would
     been making more money than all but their most senior faculty. (They
     never asked what salary I wanted or would accept.)
I am still too disappointed to deal reasonably with this rejection,
especially because I saw myself as what they really needed.  It will surely
affect my expectations and possibly my hopes and aspirations as well.

Bob
