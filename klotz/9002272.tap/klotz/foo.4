Sunday Night, six o'clock.

from Porter Sq.:  walk up WHITE ST., parallel with Porter Sq. shopping center.
Take a right onto ELM ST. at the end of the shopping center.  Take your 
second left onto CEDAR ST. and at traffic light take a right onto SUMMER ST.
Walk up hill until you reach 197 on left side of street (6 or more blocks).
It's the first floor apt., just ring bell.  The walk should take 8-10 min.


driving from Kendall sq.:  Drive from BROADWAY onto HAMPSHIRE ST. when you
reach Symbolics.  Drive up Hampshire until taking a right onto PROSPECT ST.-
it's a major cross street with Kentucky Fried Chicken on your left.  Follow
Prospect St. awhile, it's a rather straight road, until you've gone over a
small bridge and see a Dunkin' Donuts at the bottom of the hill you're on.
Take a left after the Dunkin' Donuts and move into the right hand lane.
Take the second right,(after the Vets Memorial) onto BOW ST. staying to the
right, and when the road forks, go up the hill straight ahead.  Bow St. is
now SUMMER ST.. Follow Summer three blocks.  When you see the Catholic 
Church on the right slow down.  197 is the first apt building on the right,
at the next corner.  Take a right turn at my cross street BELMONT, and park.
I'm in the First floor apt., just ring the bell.  -- this is not the fastest
route but the easiest to follow--

DONT FORGET MY PHONE #:  776-0198


ps  My sister Lisa is coming also.        Mary
