Below is a translation of a portion of The Nakhi Song of the Dead,
Relating the Origin of Bitterness.  Nakhi is spoken in Yunnan Province,
southern China by about 230,000 people (1984).  Called Moso by the
Chinese, it is of the Tibeto-Burman family.  The writing is pictographic
[I'll send you a Xerox], and represetnts one of the few pictographic
systems still in use in the 20th century.

This excerpt and information comes from "Languages of the World" by
Kenneth Katzner, and the translation itself from "The Zhi ma Funeral
Ceremony of the Na-Khi of Southwest China," Joseph F. Rock, St. Gabriel's
Mission Press, Vienna 1955

The yak he dances there it is the custom
on La-ts'u:-ho:ddu: gko
the stag said he would like to dance there.
For the stag
to dance is not the custom,
the elkskin shoes with the white front
the sons of bitterness wear;
the stag he dances there it is the custom.
Where the pines are the young deer want to dance,
the cloven-hoofed they sway in rhythm,
they sway and dance as is the custom.
All the people of the village.
