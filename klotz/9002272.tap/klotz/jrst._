Marlene was just being weird because she's unbelievably insecure about
AMT, Seymour and all the politics.  When Marlene is scared, she is
capable of being a) really rude and b) unreasonable to the people that
care about her.  She's been working on trying to be accepted by those
folks, and probably felt that she wouldn't be able to move freely if
with you.  Yucko.  It reminds me of something that just happened, which
was also a kind of rejection:  there was a guy a that I sort of liked,
but sort of would just like to be friends with, and don't know very
well.  And very uncharacteristically, extremely uncharacteristically, I
asked him if he wanted to go to a movie this weekend.  It's really my
policy, especially after Patrick, but before him too, to wait for guys
to ask me out unless it's just an obvious, easy and perfect moment for
me to propose something.  This was certainly not the perfect moment, but
I was lonely and wanted something to think about in my life.  Anyway,
in the gentlest possible way, he said no, that he was too busy.  And I
got felt quite, quite rejected and foolish for having asked.  I tell
myself that there was no reason, but I feel that I was inappropriate and
undisciplined, and I'm embarrassed.  Which just reconfirms my policy ,
if I can hold to it.  I guess I couldn't be happy in the long run in a
love relationship that I had initiated and have to keep running anyway.
And there's something to be said for the people who like me enough to
ask me out.   (Of course, this leaves out of the argument the issue of
why I think men should be braver than I.  But I won't defend that.  I
guess that I have to be really sure that I'm wanted, though, in order to
be at my best, and I want to be at my best, and more passive men just
won't see me that way, as Patrick did not in fact see me very often.
One of the reasons I wasn't always good at supporting Patrick was that I
didn't have a secure enough, respected enough position to do so.)   Oh
well.  It's not over till it's over.

In any case, you wouldn't want to hang out with the AMT types.  Their
not so very nice.

I finally talked with Michael Smith today about your maybe staying
there.  The story is that he has this (small) spare room in a nice house
about a 15 minute walk from campus, near a route with a bus line.  He
also has a room-mate, who owns the house, but she really lives elsewhere
and is only around on occassional weekends.  She would have to approve
this, but probably it wouldn't be a problem.  They recently discussed a
rent of $300 for the month for someone else who was thinking of living
in the extra room. (Does that sound ok?  It sounds reasonable to me.)
One catch is that you couldn't stay there before the 4th of January,
because the room-mate who owns the house has some grown-up kids who will
be visiting.  However, you are certainly welcome to stay with me for a
few days, and you could take the BART, and I could even come pick you up
(maybe) once or twice.  The house has two bathrooms.

Michael is very nice and very funny and  you would probably get along
well.  He is originally from Zanesville, OH and played the piccolo in
the high school band.  He still has his uniform.  He also plays the
piano, but said that he wouldn't play it while you were at home if that
was a problem.  He works in Davis, which is far away, so probably isn't
home that much, anyway, and I expect that you won't be there that much.

What do you think?  In fact,  you could give me a call about it and we
could try to get things set up over the weekend, when it's probably
easier to call him anyway.

    AI hung in a fashion I'd never seen on the KS's: disk accesses would
    hang forever.  Pages in core were easily accessible; ITS ran fine
    unless you tried to touch the disk.  I could create a job and run some
    instructions in low memory, but when I tried to do a .CALL OPEN ITS
    hung.

You must have been lucky.  Our RP06's have been causing ITS to hang in this
way ever since day 1.

    I went upstairs and the system console said:
    DSK: UNIT #1 CAME BACK ONLINE 
    DSK: UNIT #0 CAME BACK ONLINE
    DSK: UNIT #1 CAME BACK ONLINE
    and some status registers.  For all three, ER1= 40000 which is Drive
    Unsafe. 

Unsafe almost always comes on.  The interesting bits were the ones in ER3,
which according to the crash dump were (according to the crufty
documentation) "AC power low", "DC power low" and "Spare" (!).

    I dumped it to CRASH DSKOFL, not that I think it will help any.

Why?  I manadged to get the ER3 bits out of it.

    Notice that the crash file was written out but the dates were not set
    on the file?

DSKDMP never sets write dates, because it doesn't know how to tell the
time.  The DMPCPY program (which TARAKA runs when the system boots) sets
the date on any file it suspects is a crash dump.  In this case, DMPCPY
wasn't able to set the date either, because you had cold booted the
machine, so ITS didn't know what time it was when DMPCPY ran.

    ...  By the way, should these be going to BUG-ITS or KS-ITS -- I can
    never tell any more.

You sent this to the right place.  KS-ITS is almost -never- the right place
to send a Bug Report.

How has your hacking been coming at MIT.  I heard (was it you who told

I have been thinking of trying to get more Boxer money.  That would
allow me flexibility to, for example, hire you if you want to come out
for the summer.  That's not the best time, weather wise, out here, but
it wouldn't interfere with school.

I'd be happy to chat about different styled steppers and hack some to

RDZ's host has a short name of "NULL".  He's been expecting the name "NULL"

If one asks, to Japanese, some question which begins with "do" or "be"
verb, he/she is likely to get either yes or no. (Especially when "or"
in the question connects two *NOUNS*.)  In this case, he/she
would be understood if the book color question mentioned above is
paraphrased into a sentence beginning with one of 5W1H.
 
e.g.  Do you want the red book or the green book?
      ==>  Which do you want, the red book or the green book?
 
Incidentally, if Japanese translate the paraphrased question into Japanese,
it goes like "Anata ga hoshii nowa, akai hon ka, midori no hon ka?".
 
There would be no misinterpretation about the shrine question,
since in that sentence the "or" connects two *sentences*.

Dear Leigh,

Good luck on your final!  Studying really does take a long time.  When I
was in school, I was hysterical most of the time.  However, once you've
gotten through, it really makes you feel good, and then working seems
much easier.  (Like hitting your head against a wall and stopping.)  It
really does make you feel good, though.  Graduating from college is one
of the few things in my life that I'm proud of.  Also, studying gets
easier after a while, you learn better habits, understand the game
better, et c.  

Jock is an asshole, but we already knew that.  HOWEVER, the problem with
Dave  as  a lawyer  is that he is way too belligerent.  Don't know about
your other lawyer, but whatever Jock has done wrong, you are likely to
suffer if you take him to court, even if the findings are in your favor.
For one thing, court cases take years and years.  My mother worked in
the civil and supreme courts (of the State of New York)  for 12 years,
and I used to sit in the courtroom sometimes, and hear about this all
the time.  In fact, once I even sued someone.  It took 6 years to come
up for trial.  It's important to figure out an appropriate stance, but
equivalently important to avoid escalating confrontations.

Golly, I'll be delighted if you take introduction to poetry.   

I think you should take Japanese, because it's very very important to
pursue one's interests and be happy.  It's important to graduate too,
but I have a fundamental belief, honed by years of experience, that if
you do what you're good at and enjoy, you have a much better life than
if you don't, and things tend to work out.

I don't know what I'm doing over Christmas, probably nothing.  I'm a
little bit scared, because I have 5 free days and absolutely nothing
planned, and everyone I really know and like is going away.  Maybe I'll
put together a dinner party of people I only know a little bit.

I should tell you that I am planning on going skiing the weekend of
January 17, 18 and 19.  Will you still be here then?

I have been thinking about your birthday.  What would you like to do for
it?  I'm looking forward to seeing you, of course.

Do you need a place to stay in Berkeley?  I might be able to find a
place.

Hello, racer.  I have a fun story to tell you.  There is a guy named David
Daoud (I hope I've managed to spell his name right) working at Sun
Microsystems out here.  One of our salesmen, a nice pleasant fellow from
Toledo, anem of Don Kirk, asked me about him, having heard that this dude was
from MIT.  He actually claimed to have heard that the guy had worked for the
lab, but I told him that, to the best of my knowledge, this fellow had never
worked for the lab, although he could have been some sort of peripheral
cerebropathy.  I added that I had it on good authority that the guy was also a
weenie scumbag.

Don Kirk then had to go talk to David Daoud (that's why he'd been checking him
out beforehand).  Mr. Daoud asked if there was anyone at Lucid from MIT.  Don
mentioned me, and, by Don's account, Mr. Daoud evinced surprise, and said that
I was a "fairly famous person at the AI Lab."  Don said, Umm, well, he speaks
well of you, too.  On hearing this, I said to Don, You liar; I believe the
exact word I used was "scumbag".  Don said, Well, that's what salesmen do;
they lie to customers.

Anyway, I thought you'd like this story.

Remind me to tell you another story, about a high school friend of mine who is
now a spook for the Fed.

-A racer.

I am trying to retrieve two font files used by the old atari
music system. They were probably on :src. Although
their subdirectory still exists - oz:oz:<fonts.tv>, it is now
empty. GROVEL doesn't seem to be able to find them.
They are:

<fonts.tv>musfnx.bfd
<fonts.tv>nmusic.bfd

If there are other types of the font files besides the bfd
types, I could use them, too. I am making an altered
version of the old system, so for now they could go in
my directory, oz:<muse>.

				Thanks,

I've been in a weird mood lately.  The day before yesterday I couldn't think,
and I started writing a story.  It's very weird, so far, and I haven't made my
mind up about it.  I thought I'd send you the beginning.

--------------------------------
It wasn't that long ago I last saw Matthew, and I'll tell you about it if you
want.  I don't know very much, living where I do, but I can tell that things
outside are different than they were when I came in here.  But it's all right
in here.

It's been years since I came here, but Matthew's the only one who came to
visit me, and I wonder sometimes what that meant about him; the first time he
came I hoped he might be looking around, maybe thinking of staying here
himself, and so I could wink at him, thinking that we both knew what he was
doing, and I thought so the more because Matthew was one of those people who
you could share a thing like that with, like a favorite uncle come to
Thanksgiving dinner; you might be laughing and he might be laughing and it was
because you both knew something was funny, even if your parents and brothers
and sisters didn't.

But now I think that Matthew was never planning on staying; I think he had
really come just to talk to me.  It's hard to believe that, at first, because
why would anyone come all the way out here, so far from all those things that
are going on now in the outside world, why come in here where there isn't
anything magical and everything is the way it always was, with the afternoon
sunlight on these old white walls and the trees and the grass outside?  Unless
you wanted to come to stay.  And even then, there must be other places like
this, where people like me were able to go, people who didn't want to stay out
there when everything became the way it is now.


I went to school with Matthew.  I lived at home in those days, and I remember
that where we went to school there were angels.  Sometimes I wondered if maybe
Matthew was one.  I have lots of time to think now, and I think that the
angels were probably the first part of the changing, and, in those days, they
were less pure, so that you could know one.  So that even Matthew might have
been one.

Someone said that angels were the first things God ever made, when he was more
generous, but then why would they have shown up only here at the tail end of
creation?  Unless God is more like us than some people think; maybe in the
days when he was making things he set them aside, in a stack, and when he was
finished he took things off the top and placed them out in the world.  And
he's done so up until this day, and only now is he near the bottom.  So the
last came first and the first come last.


I want you to understand what I mean.  You look just like one of us, but is
that just a gentleness, is that just for me?  I know now that there are
different kinds of angels, but I don't think that there were any who would
have an easy time of talking to one of the old people, like me.  There are the
angels who are spread so thin and airy that they're all around us.  They're
the least like us; almost all they do is throw a color on the whole world at
once.  When an angel like that passes the earth, maybe thrown out from the sun
and spreading, or maybe falling faster and faster into the sun, folding like
suds going down the drain, it surrounds us completely, and for a while we all
see and think in only one way, and that way is the angel's way.  That's how
you can tell he's there.  It's a powerful kind of magic because it can take
everything at once, but it doesn't last long.  And there are places like this,
like this place where we are right now, and we're like holes or rips in a
veil, because the angel doesn't reach here.  I think sometimes how it must
look from outer space, the angel falling across the whole world like a color,
except for a few places that shine through the way they were, like stars or
sequins in a veil.  And this is one of those places.

Can the angels like that see us?  Do they feel us as we pass through them?
I'm not sure the angels can feel anything.  As time goes on, things get more
and more pure.  When the world was filled with old people, just only people
like me, things were mixed; everything could do and everything could feel.
Even the animals could feel things happening to them, and they could do things
to the world.  Like me; I can do and I can feel.

But now everything is flying apart into essences.  I think the angels are the
purest purenesses of doing.  They can do things to the world, the things that
God set them to do at first, and they never need to feel anything, because it
wouldn't change what they would do anyway.  They only act.

And then there are the ones, not angels, who only feel.  You might think that
you could never see them if they could never act, but even though people used
to argue about things like this, I think we can tell at this end of the world
that just being there isn't acting.  Because I've seen some of the ones who
only feel, and they really existed, and their existence hardly affected
anything, especially not the angels.

The ones who only feel are sometimes brought here.  I think they're brought
here because in this fixed point, among the old ones like me, people hope they
might become whole again, but I don't know.  I've never seen it happen; all
they do is cry and yell as angels pass across the earth.  I said before that
the angels don't reach in here, but when I look at the ones who only feel, I
wonder.  And I worry some about myself.  Because even though I'm one of the
old ones, the ones who can both feel and do, I don't see myself doing as much
as before.  And I'm afraid, even with dignity I'm afraid that my doing will be
torn from me, and someday I might be nothing but one of the ones who rock back
and forth on their beds, laughing and looking as the light angels pass through
them like little clouds, and then weeping and screaming and screaming under
the dark ones.


But I was going to tell you about the other kinds of angels.  People used to
say that there were hierarchies of angels, but I think that orders would be a
better word.  Because I don't think they concern themselves much with
commanding.  
--------------------------------

and there's going to be more, but I haven't written it yet.  I think it'll
need some work when I'm done, because I just sort of wrote flat out without
even thinking a little about what I was going to write, which is really weird
for me.  I mean, I didn't think about any of it, not the plot, not the style,
nothing.

So, tell Mister Dave that I sent him mail.

I am almost sure that I have a place you might be interested in staying

It's with Michael Smith, who is a friend of Lucy and Susans, and really
nice.  He has this house about 15 minutes by foot from the campus, and
directly on a bus line, and a small spare room with a bed in it.  I'll
try to find out more details.  (I haven't talked to him myself about
it.)

How much are you willing to pay and when do you think you'd actually be
out here?

One common idiom similar to `Yama no mono ka umi no mono ka wakaranai'
in the metaphoric style that I know of is:
  Me kara uroko ga toreru (or ochiru).  It means to understand in 
`satoru' manner.

On your second question. Yes. It is called the "Code of the
Japanese Graphic Character Set for Information Interchange"
JIS publication C 6226-1983. There may be a later version.
While in Tokyo in Oct. '83, I visited Ms. Mariko Takahashi
at the Japan Information Processing Development Center
and at that time got a hand annotated, lots of corrections
and changes were going on at that time, of the standard.
It was interesting to me to see what types of changes and corrections were
being made to the various Kanji in the standard. If anyone
has more recent info, I'd like to know of it.

For most of yesterday (Thursday the 18th) COMSAT on MC was catatonic.  Our
guess is that it was stuck in a JOB device wait (waiting for the DQ
device).  As soon as Alan looked at the situation COMSAT started running
again, so probably something he did caused COMSAT to get PCLSR'd out of the
system call for the first time all day, and the second time the timing
screw did not occur.

The right thing is for someone to fix the last bug in the JOB/BOJ code.

A quick fix the COMSAT maintainers might consider, is to take an occasional
%PIRLT interrupt to keep its interactions with DQ lubricated.

A better fix would be for Alan to finish up the improved Domain Demon
interface, so that COMSAT can use it instead, and not be subject to this
particular class of ITS bug.
