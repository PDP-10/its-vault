"Frost at Midnight"
							Leigh Klotz
							March 19, 1987

The frost in "Frost at Midnight" is explicitly mentioned only at the
beginning and end of the poem, both times performing a secret ministry.
At the end of the poem, the frost makes icicles, the steeples of nature.

The icicles are silent, the night is windless, and the frost is secret.
Throughout the poem, quietness and stillness play an important role.
Midnight, the dead of night, is a quiet time in a village of the late 18th
century.

At the beginning of the poem an owlet cries out twice, breaking the
extreme quiet and stillness.  Now aware that he had been gazing at the
fire, the narrator notes that it was not the fire itself that he was
looking at, but the soot fluttering in the fire.  The soot is the "sole
unquiet thing," and the only other moving thing in the "hush of nature."
The narrator is alone except for his infant child, who is in a cradle, a
cage of sorts.  The other "inmates" of his cottage, too, are asleep.  Only
he and the fluttering soot are free.

The narrator backs away from giving the fluttering soot the quality of
life by saying that it represents a mirroring of his "idling Spirit."  The
soot "makes a toy of Thought;" that is, it makes him remember the past and
think of the future in a way difficult to represent in rational thought.

Coleridge never uses the word "soot," instead introducing the concept with
the word "film" and then metonymically using the word "stranger" to stand
for the phenomenon.  By saying "film," he intimates that there is some
slight separation or barrier between his world and the world of the fire,
one of the four elements of nature.  The associations of "stranger" with
"strange" impart a feeling of mystery or secrecy to the nature of the fire
and the dancing soot.  The element of fire stands in counterpoint to the
frost, also described as secret, and to the wind, which is absent.

In stanza two, the fluttering soot reminds him of school days, when he
used to watch the soot in the fire and daydream about his birthplace and
the sounds of the church bells, falling asleep with the dreams.  The next
day in the schoolroom he would be unable to concentrate on his studies,
yearning to go outside through the half-open door, and looking to see the
fluttering-soot-foretold arrival of a familiar face (perversely referred
to as a "stranger.")

The church bells the narrator remembers give him a "wild pleasure."  They
were "sounds of things to come."  This fullness of sound differs from the
disrutbing quiet which the narrator is enduring in the present.

The chronology of these experiences and memories is quite complicated.
Stanza one sets up a particular moment in the narrrator's adult life: a
moment of watching the soot dance in a fire and of reminiscing.  In stanza
two the narrator recalls earlier episodes of this experience from sometime
in his school days, and the accompanying memories of a still-earlier time
of young childhood.  These memories are of thinking about how the sounds
of the church bells seemed like the sounds of the future.  This realization
startles the reader into the present the same way the owlet's cry does
the narrator at the beginning of the poem.  The speaker in "Frost at
Midnight" no longer has memories of his "sweet birthplace," only memories
of memories.  The reader is even further removed, having to try to
understand Colerdge's feelings through his written, rational recollections.

The narrator's watching the fluttering soot is like Wordsworth's visiting
the river Wye in "Lines Composed a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey,"
published in the same year.  Both poems employ a confusion of past and
present, of memory and presage, of experience current and experience
remembered:  A man is the sum of his past experiences, and cannot be
separated from them.

"Frost at Midnight" divides itself into two roughly equal parts.  The
narrator presents himself as an adult, and then remembers his childhood.
Then he addresses his infant child, and talks about his hopes for the
child's future.  The narrator's present and past are tied together through
a recurring experience of reverie while gazing into a fire.  The child's
future is brightened not by the fire, but by the hope that he will
experience lakes with sandy shores and ancient mountains.  

These open, solitary places, the narrator feels, will offer his child the
opportunity to learn in the "eternal language" with God as the teacher.
The narrator contrasts this classroom to his own schoolroom with the stern
preceptor and the closed door.  The mountains and lakes where the narrator
says his child will wander are quite reachable, whereas the sky and stars
he himself saw as a child are not.  The sky is not left out of the
infant's future, however; clouds, representing the power of imagination in
the child's life, form the shapes of the lakes, shores, and mountain crags
that the child will travel to just as the fluttering soot in the
narrator's life serves as a focal point for his memories of places he has
been.

In short, the speaker in "Frost at Midnight" recounts his experiences with
Nature in the form of "Sea, hill, and wood," church bells, and the play of
soot in the fire, and hopes that his child will have the whole range of
nature open to him or her in "far other scenes."
