Dear Mr. Wu,

Your letter of January 1986 has been forwarded to me.  I will
try to answer your questions as best I can.

The implementation of Logo done at MIT is available only on a royalty
basis.  The source code is available for $5000.00 plus a payment for
each copy of Logo that is sold.

The book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" describes the
language Scheme, a derivative of Lisp developed at MIT that is used in
many computer science courses in the U.S.  In addition to teaching Scheme,
it describes the ideas behind lisp-like interpreters.

"Anatomy of Lisp" by John R. Allen describes the implementation of lower-level
support for lisp -- storage management (garbage collection), reading, and
printing.

"Computer Science Logo Style" by Brian Harvey is a book on Logo programming
for high school students.

"Logo Works: Projects in Atari Logo" by Cynthia Solomon and Margaret Minsky
is a book of projects in Logo on the Atari 800 computer.  One of them
is a simple Logo interpreter written in Logo.

I would recommend Anatomy of Lisp, Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs, and Computer Science Logo Style for Logo implementation
and the other books for educational aspects.

Logo Computer Systems of Montreal, Canada has various implementations
of Logo for Z80 computers.  Their address is
Logo Computer Systems

Please write me further and describe your interests in Logo implementation
and in using Logo in education and I will try to give you a better list of
books and magazines which you might be interested in.
