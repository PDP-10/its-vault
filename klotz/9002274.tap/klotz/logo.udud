Hi.  How was California?
I know you probably don't want to think about Terrapin, but I thought you
might like to know about a small bug I found using Logo for the Mac:

You know how typing Command-Shift-4 dumps a picture of the active window to
the LaserWriter?  Well it doesn't seem to work if I've opened a new graphics
window with a new name, closed the Turtle window, and made the new window
active.  If I make a design and then try Command-Shift-4, I get a system bomb!

(sad face)

See you sometime!
Alison.

Leigh,

I've had some time to work with Logo for the Mac and found some behaviors
with SAVE which I hope we can fix.  Primarily, when you save immediately
before selecting QUIT, it still prompts you if you want to save.  Can't
we have it know that there is nothing changed since last save and not
prompt?  Also, when you select quit and select that you want to save
before quiting, it goes out and saves, but does not quit.  You again 
select QUIT and get the dialog box about saving and the only way out is
to say NO to saving before quiting.

I also got it to crash when I simply tried to save a picture fiel
woops--file from the floppy version (12/16/86).
