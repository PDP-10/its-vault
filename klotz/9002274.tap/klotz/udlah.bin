Dear Leigh, 

Is there any way you could wander around project Athena and check out
how Wendy is doing?  I'm pretty worried about her.  Maybe you could have
lunch with her?  Talk about Boxer, distract her.  She's in a very
delicate state, and doesn't have very many friends, and evidently has
lost six pounds in the last week.  It would be a mitzvah, as my people
say.    

 I'm going to see Eric Roehmer's Summer  this weekend, it's supposed to
be good.
Maybe I'll move to England.

Lots of Love,

Debbie
