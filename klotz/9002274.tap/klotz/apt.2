The apartment is the first floor of a 2-1/2 story house on Smith Avenue,
right on Line street, the border between Cambridge and Somerville.  It's
very near Savenor's Market, a laundry, the Peasant Stock restaurant, and
the Wine & Cheese Cask.

The apartment has a modern kitchen with disposal and dishwasher, a living
room, a bedroom, and a bath.  The living room and bedroom are carpeted.
All the rooms get plenty of sunlight.  There's a back porch, also.
There's also a driveway with room for a car, no charge.

The apartment is large enough for a couple for the summer.  The people who
now have the upper 1.5 floors previously lived downstairs.

A couple of other people have also sent me mail asking about the
apartment.  I don't want to have to store my furniture and books, so how
the prospective subletters feel about having a semi-furnished apartment is
important to me.  My furniture is fairly spare and shoudln't get in the
way: a platform bed, two bookcases, and a kitchen table is about it.

Please tell me by when you need a decision from me, and give me a latest
bound on the earliest date by which you can decide.  I'll put the dates
from everybody together and plan accordingly.  If you'd like to see the
apartment, let me know.  Monday and Friday evenings or weekends are best
for me.
