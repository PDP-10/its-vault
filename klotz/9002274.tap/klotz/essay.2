In 1980, I began working at the M.I.T. Logo Laboratory, a joint project of
the M.I.T. Division for Study and Research in Education and the M.I.T.
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.  Logo is a programming language
developed at M.I.T. over the past fifteen years for use by children and other
people new to programming.  Logo is designed to encourage mathematical
exploration and individual thinking.

I worked under Prof. Seymour Papert and Prof. Harold Abelson on the
development and implementation of Logo for the Apple II computer, and
developed a special Music Logo for Prof. Jeanne Bamberger.  I co-authored,
with Prof. Abelson, the M.I.T. Logo language manual.

After the close of the Logo Lab, I worked at Terrapin, Inc., a
Cambridge firm which received from M.I.T. a license to market and
further develop the Logo technology.  At Terrapin I enhanced the Logo
implementation for the Apple II and adapted Logo to the various
Commodore computers; the Commodore 64 implementation was the
largest-selling version of Logo to date.

In 1982 I returned to M.I.T. to work for the new Educational Computing
Group at the Laboratory for Computer Science.  Under the direction of
Prof. Andrea diSessa and Prof. Abelson, the group was developing Boxer, an
integrated computing environment which was to incorporate ideas from
cognitive science in understanding the activity of programming.  One of
the aims of Boxer was to encourage the writing, and particularly the
organizing, of programs by letting users place Boxer procedures and data
in nested boxes, and by arranging these boxes in a two-dimensional format
on the screen.

I concentrated on the Boxer language itself, participating in a design
forum with cognitive scientists and other computer science researchers.
During this period I gained a better understanding of the problems of
designing a programming environment which conforms to the expectations of
naive users.

Toward the end of my first year with the group, M.I.T. licensed the
Logo technology to Leona Educational Systems of Tokyo, Japan.  I went
to work at Leona for two weeks in the spring of 1983 to help the Leona
engineers begin their project of adapting the Logo language to Hitachi
computers.  The Hitachi computer was the first Japanese personal
computer to use the {\em hiragana} syllabary, the writing
system children first learn to use; previous computers had used only
{\em katakana}, which finds its application mostly in the
writing of foreign loan words and advertising displays.  The
Leona/M.I.T.  implementation was the first version of Logo in
Japanese, and also the first for a Japanese computer.

I returned to Japan for another two weeks in the summer of 1983 for the
completion of the Hitachi Logo project.  We discussed issues in
translating the Logo command names and error messages, and I explained the
Logo group's motivations in its choices for the English words.

In the fall of 1984 I left the Educational Computing Group and
re-entered M.I.T. as a sophomore.  Over the next two academic years I
consulted for Terrapin, co-authoring an implementation of Logo for the
Apple Macintosh computer.  While in Japan I had become interested in the
Japanese language and culture, and once an M.I.T. student again I decided
to study Japanese.  At that time M.I.T. did not offer a course on the
Japanese language; however, the excellent Harvard Japanese program was
open to M.I.T. students.

Finding Japanese more interesting than the freshman- and
sophomore-level courses I was taking at M.I.T., I put much of my
academic energy into my Japanese studies at Harvard, learning a great
deal but unfortunately receiving grades which did not factor in to my
M.I.T. grade point average.

I returned to the M.I.T. Educational Computing Group as a full-time staff
member for one year, working to produce a final implementation of
Boxer for use in schools.  I worked mainly at M.I.T., but since Prof.
diSessa had taken an appointment at U.C. Berkeley, I spent a few weeks
working with his research group in the program for Education in Math,
Science and Technology at Berkeley.

During the Fall 1986 semester I both worked at M.I.T. and took one course in
electrical engineering.  I decided to return to M.I.T. as a full-time student
beginning with the Spring 1987 semester.

Although I have not formally studied Japanese in two years, I find time
to read books or magazines daily, and have developed conversational
skills through talking with Japanese friends and visitors.  I have an
interest in both modern and classical Japanese literature.

\begin{center}Education, Economics, and Japanese Culture\end{center}
\vspace{1em}
Increasingly, politicians and educators in Japan and the United States are
looking to the opposite side of the Pacific for new ideas in education.
American popular interest in Japan is at an all-time high: magazine
articles and television programs explore cultural and economic aspects of
Japan, and some news networks offer daily news on Japan.  Not
coincidentally, Japan is perceived increasingly as an economic force with
the power to affect our daily lives here in the United States.  Recent
statistics indicate that Japanese students average higher on standardized
mathematics tests than their American counterparts, that more Japanese
than Americans finish high school, and that despite the alarming
complexity of the Japanese language from the American viewpoint the adult
illiteracy rate in Japan is miniscule.

The United States' economy is fast losing ground to Japan's.  The balance
of trade between the United States and Japan is seen as by some as an
indicator, and by some as a cause, of our economic problems.  In the past
few years, the boom of interest in Japan has shown that Americans are
beginning to recognize Japan as a world economic power, its people as
intellectual competitors, and its culture as significant.  The origins of
this attention are no doubt economic, but the interest itself has remained
and grown.  While economic analysts have known about the Japanese economy
for years, it was this popular awareness of Japan and Japanese culture
which has brought these economic facts to light for the populace.
Americans are beginning to connect Japanese education with the Japanese
rising economy.

The recent resurgence of interest in educational reform in the United
States, more pronounced than any since the Sputnik era, is not
surprising when viewed in light of these facts.  It is true that the
United States educational system is in poor shape, and that there is
widespread student apathy.  But we cannot adopt Japanese educational
solutions to our problems here in the United States; we need to act in
an informed manner, with an understanding of how education works in
Japanese culture, and what the tradeoffs in Japanese education are.  Of
course, the Japanese educational system is not solely responsible for
Japan's economic success, nor is it even necessarily responsible for
Japanese educational success; the role of differing work ethics and of
the culture surrounding education is not to be denied.

Since the scientific and technological capability of a nation is an
important factor in its economic power, it makes sense that both the
governments of the United States and Japan would pay attention to
math, science and technology education as part of their drive for
economic success.  American education is perceived as producing
somewhat undisciplined, independent, creative thinkers, whereas
Japanese education is thought to bring up careful, attentive
individuals who almost as a matter of national pride lack creativity.
Although these stereotypes are inaccurate, they are beliefs widely
held: {\em U.S. News and World Report} quotes Nobuo Matsunaga, the
Japanese ambassador to the United States, as saying that Japan depends
``...almost wholly on the United States for basic technological
research.''

Here in the United States, the use of computers in schools has recently
become matter-of-fact.  Computer use is decided at a district or state
level, with each program having a different emphasis.  Some schools use
game-like software to teach particular subjects, such as geography or
history.  Other schools use computers as tools, much as adults do, letting
students use word processors for composition, and databases for storing
information.  A growing number of schools in the United States are using
Logo to give children the opportunity to develop mathematical thinking.  A
combination of these approaches is likely to yield results, but no one can
say exactly how best to use computers in schools without widespread
experimentation.

In Japan, the Ministry of Education is actively investigating the use of
microcomputers in middle- and high-school education, in an apparent
attempt to borrow American ideas on science and engineering education.
However, in contrast with the history of educational computing in the
United States, the Ministry of Education will likely administer the
project on a national scale, mandating a set curriculum of computer
education in each school in the country.  Unless the Ministry of Education
takes a more organic approach, encouraging experimentation in schools and
allowing a natural pattern of computer use to develop in Japanese culture,
the result is likely to be a sterile environment with little room for
creativity.  Similarly, the Ministry cannot simply draw on the United
States experience, as it will be largely inapplicable to schools in the
Japanese culture.

In summary, it seems that Eastern/Western cultural differences, economic
issues, and problems in math, science, and technology education are the
three topics on which Japanese and Americans should share their knowledge.
Through my work with Logo, I have been involved in math and science
education in the United States, and, to some extent, in Japan.  I have a
strong interest in Japanese culture and language, and would very much like
to work with Japanese students toward better mutual understanding of
education in our countries.
