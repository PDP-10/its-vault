If you write me back and tell me exactly what parts of Logo you are
interested in I will try to give you a list of other magazines or
books that might be helpful.  Are you interested in implementing
Logo or in using Logo?  Are you interested in using Logo with
young children, wih older children, or by yourself?  Are you interested
in the educational aspects of Logo or the computer science aspects?

Good luck,
