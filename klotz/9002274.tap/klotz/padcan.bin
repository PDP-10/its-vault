Subject: problems

Sorry I didn't answer your message sooner -- Therese and I have both had a
truly terrible flu and have been convalescing in San Francisco for a few days.
Don't be so apologetic about telling me about your problems.

Yes, Therese has cervical cancer, but cervical cancer, it turns out, is one of
the least dangerous forms of cancer.  Her case is probably not invasive, which
means that it's probably a not very major surgical procedure to get rid of it.
Something like 4% of all women get it, and it almost never requires
chemotherapy, so I think she'll be okay.  Of course, it is cancer, and that's
always serious, so I'm quite concerned, but the theory is that it's been
caught fairly early on.

Anyway, you sound fairly bummed out, but I wouldn't say it was just over
Noyuri.  Long observation has shown me that you regularly go through cycles of
depression, and my theory is that this is another of those.  So maybe seeing
your shrink is a good idea.  You know, if he doesn't want to see you on a
regular basis, perhaps you want to go see another shrink.  Given that we know
of a great many people who have seen him, I would say that he has a rather
extensive practice, and perhaps the reason he is reluctant to see you
regularly is that he has no slots free in his schedule.  You might try asking
him to refer you to someone for therapy.

You should keep working on this 6.002 stuff, though, even if it is painful.  I
suspect that you'll have a real sense of achievement if you struggle through
it, even if you only get a C.  You are attempting something substantial, after
all -- going back to a very hard school after not studying this kind of stuff
for years is really quite difficult.

How was Debbie's visit to Cambridge?  I think about her a lot, and I hope
she's doing well.  I believe I really will be coming back, barring disaster.
If this is one of those winters where there's no snow on the roads, I'll get
the Datsun out of there as soon as I'm back.

I just had a really scary experience.  I went to give blood, and at the
end, suddenly my stomach started to hurt a lot, and then I found I was
breathing really hard, and sweating, and my hands and feet were numb.
So they put my feet up and had me breath into a bag (because I was
hyperventilating), and had me lie and sit for a long time.  Then I drank
two glasses of orange juice, a cup of coffee and ate two pieces of
coffee cake as if it was all nothing.   It's several hours later, and
now I feel ok, but as tired as if I had been run over by bull-dozer.  So
I'm getting a ride home with a friend who lives in the city.  I don't
think I'm going to give blood for a while.

    I took a long shot and patched the instructions at QINTAT+23 from
    IORDQ A,mumble to MOVE A,QPOSGL(Q).  The system works like a champ
    with that patch!  If I'm not mistaken (remember, I'm hacking blindly
    from EDDT), what I've pretty much done is sabotage seek error
    detection, right?

Well, that's what I would have thought...  However, a close look at some
documentation I thought I had read before reveals that the RM03, unlike the
RP0n's, doesn't have a Current Cylinder register at all.  Instead there is
some kind of maintenance register at that address.  I guess that little
consistency check should just be removed for RM03 systems.  The drive is
supposed to signal an error if it has a problem seeking anyway.

    The second bring up of the system after running the Salvager to note
    the address of the front end filesystem deletes the .TEMP. and CRASH
    directories.  Is this expected?  I created a silly -DONT- DELETE link
    to make those directories non-empty.

Not necessary.  There is a little table of directories that ITS will make
automatically whenever anyone references them.  This table includes .TEMP.
and CRASH.

    I started loading the filesystem, but DUMP fails in a OPEN right
    away complaining that .INFO. doesn't exist.  If there is an option to
    DUMP to instruct it to create directories, I couldn't find it.

Oops.  We goofed.  We intended to fix that before sending out the next
distribution kit, but forgot all about it.  There certainly should be an
option to DUMP to make it do that, and I can't imagine how we got this far
without it...  For the moment, you can just create the directories yourself
by hand whenever DUMP complains and then just proceed it.

    I hope that my information about the QINTAT+23 patch gives you guys
    enough information to develop a more suitable patch.

Your current patch is just about as good as any we could have given you.

Super!

     Okay, here's what I've done so far.  Whenever testing ITS, I yanked
the id plugs out of the other drives so ITS can't possibly see them.  I
tried the various breakpoints that you've suggested, and here's what I
observed.  The system is getting periodic attention interrupts, perhaps
at the 1/2 second rate you referred to.  It gets to QINTAT+25 where it
compares A with QPOSGL.  At this point A holds 10700 and QPOSGL holds 631.
My impression from DDT is that the drive got a seek done attention
interrupt, it wants cylinder 631, and it got 10700 as the position
instead.  It reacted by doing a recalibrate, and got another one of these
attention interrupts and...

     The system CAN be shutdown by the SH console command.

     It takes a couple of seconds after the CRLF from the Salvager
finishing before it gets into this state.

     I could not hear any obvious seeking noises from the drive when
the system was in this state.

	 I tried it again.  Each time QCST contained 104204.  NQSATN, NQEATN,
    and NQOFFL all contained 0.  I suspected as much, since the disks I am
    using have no errors, ECC or otherwise.

	 I rather doubt that it is disks interrupting endlessly.  From what I
    was able to trace, it looked like the code was looping at interrupt level
    and never dismissing.

More things to look at:

QSDU/ unit actually transferring or -1 if controller idle
QSEEK/ per-unit, -1 if seeking
QRCAL/ per-unit, -1 if recalibrating

That's the first line of figuring out what the software thinks it's doing.
Also put a breakpoint at QINT3X before starting the system and see how many
times it gets there.  QINTE is a good place to put a breakpoint, too
(most disk errors go there).
Put a breakpoint at RHCHEK if you want to see every command it sends to
the disk.
Breakpoint at QINTAT+2 to intercept attention handling (Q is drive number).

My guess is it initiated the first seek and then lost when the attention
came back, since %HXSC and %HMSEK are in QCST.  I don't have very high
confidence in this guess, though.  It's quite a mystery.

On the 'new' Unix finger from borax:

I wrote the finger, designed the database and egged on the people
who did the rest of the work on it. It was intended to be 'public
domain', with something like the PC/IP copyright notice on it
(saying you can do ANYTHING you want with this code except remove
the copyright notice). I don't want to debate the merits of various
copyrights; just want to make the intentions clear.

I had hoped to finish it up, give it to RMS, send it to Berkeley,
and post it to net.sources. I got distracted by other things and
left MIT before finishing it, though. Now Mark Rosenstein, who
has spoken up a couple of times recently, is hacking it.

    Presently I halted it and poked around.  I found that the system was
    looping in the code at QINT2C.  It would eventually get to the
    SKIPGE D,QSRAC(C) at QINT2L+2; QSRAC+36 contained 0 so it jumped back
    to QINT2C, go to the SETO C, at QINT2D+1, and began the cycle again.

This doesn't make complete sense, because if the SKIPGE D,QSRAC(C)
skipped (having a 0 operand), it would have skipped -over- the JRST
QINT2C.  More likely the instruction before it, SKIPL QUSR(C), skipped
(i.e. this disk channel was not in use).  My question would be, did it
get to QINT3X or was it looping inside the disk scheduler proper?  I
would expect it to find nothing to do on the disk and come out to
QINT3X.  I guess that's the root of Alan's continuous interrupt theory
too.  Note the comment there that the RH11 doesn't seem to need to reset
pending interrupt requests.  If it is getting to QINT3X, but just
interrupting again, the best way to proceed would be to see what the
hardware thinks it's doing.  Note: the software causes a disk interrupt
every 1/2 second, for the benefit of broken disk controllers, so it
might look to you like it's interrupting continuously when its problem
is really something else.  The SH (is that right?) command to the
front-end to get to DDT should work if it's not in continuous disk
interrupts; it's implemented by PI7, the lowest priority interrupt
level.

Don't blame me, I didn't write this disk code.  It's actually very
straightforward, but that fact is obscured because almost all of the
labels are remarkably poorly chosen.  I'm told it started life as
microtape code and gradually evolved.

Another guess I have is that you have extra RM03s that you didn't tell
ITS about.  I don't think we've tried having extra disk drives attached
to an RH11 before.  Were they on-line?  Powered-up?  Of course extra
drives shouldn't screw things up, but there might be a bug.

	 I initially thought it was looping in the salvager, but after
    running the standalone salvager and poking around a bit I realized it
    was looping in ITS.  I tried starting ITS at GO without running the
    salvager; this time it got stuck in the code including QDW3/QPOSR+11,
    etc.

My guess is that this is simply another point in the same loop, not a
different symptom.

    please consider replacing the cretinous ITS
    EDDT with DEC EDDT or KDDT.  I imagine you have already considered this,
    since there really is no good reason for yet another DDT.

Thanks for the suggestion, but I don't think we're interested.
"Cretinous" and "yet another" are relative terms.  From our point of
view the DEC EDDTs are "yet another".

	 Turning to more important matters, if you want to debug this you
    are quite welcome to.  

I don't think MIT has a lot of resources for software support, and I really
shouldn't be spending a great deal of time on this either.  ITS comes to
you on an as-is basis, as they say.

    I'm sure this would be
    a helluva lot faster than trying to second-guess the problem remotely
    and sending another set of tapes only to find that they fail too...

Sure, but I imagine if the bug is diagnosed at this end, we would send
you a patch to type in rather than fussing around with tapes.  If you're
familiar with the RH11 hardware it would probably be quickest for you
to diagnose it yourself, unless the problem is really something intricate
in the software rather than a straightforward hardware-related problem.
That would be the thing to look for first, in my experience.

Subject: Losing a minor mode
To: bug-emacs%OZ.AI.MIT.EDU@XX.LCS.MIT.EDU

Maybe a bug, maybe my VARS file:

In my vars file (oz:<afb>emacs.vars) there is a TeX mode hook
defined as follows ( I stole most of it):


TeX Mode Hook:"1,(M.M^R Dictionary Lookup Word)M.Q...$w
!*               1M.LAuto Fill Modew  !
!*              :I*\M.LParagraph Delimiterw !
		0mm& Alter ..D\Aw  !* no expand after \  (do it in tex) !
               5*` :f..D_(w !* Flash single quotes like parens!
               5*' :f..D_)`" !* Flash single quotes like parens!
 !* Keep the previous line last in the Tex Mode Hook!
 !* (because of the right single quote)!

Here's the problem.  Since the Auto-Fill is commented out, it
doesn't start up automatically, which is fine.  Often in TeX one
doesn't want filling of equations and the like.  But when writing
plain text, I set auto fill mode on, but leave the mode as TeX
mode to check dollar signs etc.  However, if I leave the buffer,
(to some other buffer), or exit emacs and then return to the TeX
buffer, SOMETIMES I have lost the auto-fill mode.  I haven't done
a systematic check of when I lose auto-fill and when not.

Any suggestions?

Thanx -- afb

    ...  I regret to inform you that the installation was unsuccessful.

Well I understand that you are disappointed, but I'm actually impressed
that it worked as smoothly as it did.  Specifically, I'm happy to hear that
the salvager apparently works.

         I got as far as building @ ITS and running it.  It typed
    "Salvager 226" and pawed over the disks for a while.  It then typed
    a CRLF and went silent.  I waited several minutes and nothing happened.
    Presently I halted it and poked around.  I found that the system was
    looping in the code at QINT2C.  It would eventually get to the

    was looping in ITS.  I tried starting ITS at GO without running the
    salvager; this time it got stuck in the code including QDW3/QPOSR+11,
    etc.

Well, it looks like the RM03 is continuously interrupting, since all of
this is interrupt level disk code.  It would be interesting to know what
was in:

QCST	; Contents of CS1 register of disk controller when it last
	; interrupted.
NQSATN	; Count of spurious attention interrupts
NQEATN	; Count of attention interrupts reporting errors in mid-transfer
NQOFFL	; Count of times drive dropped offline

There are a bunch of other disk variables you might check, but I'm
initially betting this has something to do with some of the disk error
randomness we have observed here, and something the RM03 does makes the bug
worse.

It would be nice if there was a way to take a crash dump so that we could
look at it...

         I have two immediate suggestions.  First is that ITS should note
    various "landmarks" in what it is doing, such as outputting ITS.nnnn
    when it takes over from the salvager....

Actually, that's what the CRLF the salvager types is for.  We don't seem to
be great fans of verbosity here in ITS land.

    Second, please consider replacing the cretinous ITS EDDT with DEC EDDT
    or KDDT.  I imagine you have already considered this, since there
    really is no good reason for yet another DDT....

I don't think we ever considered this seriously.  It took about 100
keystrokes to successfully convert Exec DDT to the KS10, and once it was
working we never though about it again.

The place itself is quite nice, but socially I feel like I'm in a

if I'm done with my project before yule, i will run on home
and write the thesis when I get there.  if i'm not done by yule,
i will go to hawaii for the first part of january and finish it 
later.  i think i will be done by yule, or at least by first of
january.  i will probably not be in california in january for
more than a week.  whether that is the first week or the
third week or some other week remains to be seen.

How are Things?

I talked to Hal and he wants me to go to Berkeley for the first
two weeks of January and work with you merging my new evaluator
with your new virtual copy (and hopefully Eval data structures)
into a new Boxer.

Does that seem reasonable to you?

Leigh.

Here's what I have to do before then:

Variables:
Merge the hairy variable cache with the new evaluator.
EXPORTS (efficient). (I took them out of hairy new variables.)
Look at putting the canonical pname pointer in the function cell (since we
have the function in the value cell...)

Flavored input issues:
&REST arg flavor of some kind.
BUILD arg flavor.
DONT-COPY arg flavor for writing primitives.
Consider making TELL START X work without DONT-PORT.
DONT-PORT arg flavor.
New fast arg flavor merging scheme using numbers and array lookups.

Eval issues:
@ and ! in the evaluator (as opposed to Build)


Stack Issues:
Tail recursion.
STOP/CATCH/THROW
Stack discipline for recursive eval and exception handling.
Check out stack frames to make sure there is enough info for the debugger.
Implement a simple error handler, like what we have now.
Spec out writing a debugger/error handler using the stack.

Data Representation and primitives.
This should be simple.  The messy part is writing all the new manipulators
for the new EVAL data representation.

Richard,

I wasn't one of the people who wrote the unix implementation (although
I was one of the people standing on the side and cheering), but my
impression was that the code was intended to be free to all comers.
At one point there was some talk about using a version of your GNU
copywrite notice, I don't remember what ever happened to that idea.
At this point I'm not sure -anybody- can copywrite the code since
mar@proteon has done some work on it.  If anybody can copywrite it it
would be MIT, and it would be either a GNU style copywrite or a PC-IP
copywrite (a form which forbids nothing except removal of the
copywrite notice).

We did intend to give this code to Berkeley in the hopes that they
would make it part of the standard unix distribution.  I would be very
surprised if anybody objected to giving you a copy too (if in fact you
don't already have it).

This is assuming you were talking about the unix code, not the
proposed MTS code, of course.

I'm willing to give away the Unix implementation I'm working on once
it is in decent shape.  Some of the work was done by others at MIT,
some here at Proteon in my spare time.  I believe care has been taken
to make sure there is no Unix source code in it; the only library we
use is a supposedly public domain version of DBM.

Friends -

     I received my ITS distribution set on Tuesday, and attempted to
install it early this morning after some DECnet(ugh!) hacking.  I
regret to inform you that the installation was unsuccessful.

     I got as far as building @ ITS and running it.  It typed
"Salvager 226" and pawed over the disks for a while.  It then typed
a CRLF and went silent.  I waited several minutes and nothing happened.
Presently I halted it and poked around.  I found that the system was
looping in the code at QINT2C.  It would eventually get to the
SKIPGE D,QSRAC(C) at QINT2L+2; QSRAC+36 contained 0 so it jumped back
to QINT2C, go to the SETO C, at QINT2D+1, and began the cycle again.

     I initially thought it was looping in the salvager, but after
running the standalone salvager and poking around a bit I realized it
was looping in ITS.  I tried starting ITS at GO without running the
salvager; this time it got stuck in the code including QDW3/QPOSR+11,
etc.

     I have two immediate suggestions.  First is that ITS should note
various "landmarks" in what it is doing, such as outputting ITS.nnnn
when it takes over from the salvager.  The salvager should do something
like type a dot every n whatevers so the user knows that it is doing
something useful.  Second, please consider replacing the cretinous ITS
EDDT with DEC EDDT or KDDT.  I imagine you have already considered this,
since there really is no good reason for yet another DDT.  Is DEC EDDT
too big?  Poking at the hangs would have been a lot easier had some
very basic things such as single-stepping worked (I tried both $X and
CTRL/N).

     Turning to more important matters, if you want to debug this you
are quite welcome to.  I have an active KLINIK on my 2020; just give
me a call before I leave at around noonish (3PM your time) and I'll
be happy to give you KLINIK access and standalone time on my system
for the rest of the afternoon.  I think my wife will be home so she
could assist (e.g. mounting tapes) if you need.  I'm sure this would be
a helluva lot faster than trying to second-guess the problem remotely
and sending another set of tapes only to find that they fail too...

Well, you can get examples of how to format the output easily enough.
Do "finger sra@xx.lcs.mit.edu" from your unix machine if that works.
If it doesn't, TELNET to one of our machines and use the finger/whois
programs (you don't have to log in to do this).  Do "FINGER SRA" or
"WHOIS SRA" on AI.AI.MIT.EDU, MC.LCS.MIT.EDU, MX.LCS.MIT.EDU, or
XX.LCS.MIT.EDU (on the first three machines you have to type a ":"
character before the command).  Or if you prefer I can do it and send
you a photo log of the output.

There are a number of examples of how to and how not to write this
program.  Good examples are ITS FINGER (written in PDP-10 assembler),
MIT Twenex FINGER (PDP-10 assembler), and the unix implementation
running on BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU (written in C).  The Stanford TOPS-20
version (PDP-10 assembler) is also decent, although it provides less
data and doesn't permit individual users to update their own
information.  There are probably other decent implementations that I
don't know about.

The prime example of how -not- to do it is the Berkeley 4.2/4.3 finger
program.  I could list reasons but would become violently ill about
halfway through.  If you really care I'll find a barf bag and explain.

We can provide source code if you want it.  If you don't read PDP-10
assembler the most readable version would be the one on BORAX.  Last I
heard the sources for that were somewhat disorganized.  Maybe one of
the other people receiving this message could comment on this.

I would be more than willing to answer any specific questions you
might have.  I'd much rather spend some time explaining than have
another travesty like the Berkeley version come out.

Hello,
   We're working on an implementation of finger for our MTS hosts,
and have been working from the Network Working Group RFC #742, as
well as the format of the finger running on a BSD 4.3 Unix system.
   The RFC was written in December of 1977, and as such, contains
little more than a couple brief suggestions as to format for the
output, along with a couple examples. Needless to say, we're a bit
uncomfortable working from such sketchy and outdated information,
and would like to be informed of any changes or resolutions made
since then. We would also like these sites to eventually be added
to the list of sites with finger servers. Thanks.

Thanks for your help before I went to Japan.  I had a pretty fun time
although I ended up working a lot.  When the Japanese say "give a talk",
they don't mean 1 hour talk and 20 minutes questions.  It seems they
mean 2 hour talk and 45 minutes questions.  I ended up giving 3  2 hour
talks and one 3 hour talk, sort of.

I'll tell you more about it, but for now I thought I should tell you
that I met someone  who might be interesting for a job.  You may already
know him, and he may be a slime, but... his name is Willem Kooij, he has
a company called Promotec International which does Logo in Japan.  He is
also a senior vice president of CEC, but it is Promotec which does the
Logo work.

I gave him your name, I think he will get in touch with you, but his
address and stuff (from his card) is:

    Hackers,

    It has been suggested that it might be a good idea to teach an ITS course
    during IAP this year.  We have done this twice before with somewhat mixed
    results.  A few sessions were quite memorable, and a few were dogs.  Before
    I decide if I want to front for this again this year, I would like to hear
    from some other people.  Specifically I want to hear:

    Things people want to learn about.

    Opinions about what has worked in the past.

    Volunteers who would enjoy teaching about something.

    Ways of using this to burn excess machine cycles on our many (!) ITS
    machines.  (Student project ideas?)

I don't think I have any of my notes from IAP'83.  Do you (Alan) have
any from IAP'84?  I seemed to remember talking about some of the
following:
	UUOs/.CALL, their skip-on-success feature, their argument
	  passing/returning syntax
	TTY management
	Devices, MLDEV:, CLU/I/O/A:, etc
	Jobs (and BOJs)
	File system, links, etc.
	Greenblat's History lecture
	Moon's hardware description of (the original) AI
With the general proliferation of PCs and high level languages, some of
the more gutsy things, which are the interesting things, may require a
(refresher) course on the assembly language concepts.
