ibm has this brochure that looks like "A summary of maclisp functioýÜÆŠÃnd flags" in shape.  It talks aboutôaMAAI products.  It mentions
gclisp and gives Lucid about a page.  All the technicü;wßþY9 ÃþYFŠÃbout 15 degrees out of phase.  You should read a copy.

ok.  just getting it straight.

sounds like max $2500 this year and maybe $1500-$1800 last
year so at most i would pay you $1000.

right.  did i say i would pay you the difference between what
your taxes would have been for fiscal 1985 and what they will
be in fiscal 1986?

yeah.  maybe we do want a hairy editor though.  not hairy in the
way brian would want to make it, but maybe we want some user
interface features.  lcsi took some ideas from boxer to make
logo writer.  on the other hand, maybe we are not innarested at
all in getting involved, so you're probably right.

maybe i should go to terrapin today soon.

jock has ordered the c interface to the new file system.  it turned
out we had only the pascal stuff.  i have found code for doing
the double click stuff (file object to filename conversion) and
i found out there is routine to set the working directory to that
specified by a string.  mark found some more bugs.  i will spend
tomorrow working on it.  maybe i will go there tonight.

the editor will be a big project for the ibm logo.  after that
will be the graphics and other i/o.  people sell i/o and graphics
packages in c.  i'm going to recommend that they take a long
hard look at buying one so they don't have to worry about
support for every different graphics board and stuff.  the
spectre of ms-dos.

uh i just sent you mail by accident.

anyway, i guess you probably don't want much to do with the ibm
logo project if it happens.  i don't either.  i will try to handle
the setup here, if jock looks like he wants to forge ahead with it,
but if it really looks like something might happen i guess you'll
want to be involved in the negotiation and stuff.

well that's sort of what i meant.  i figured it was possible
you might not want to hear such things.  guess i was right.
i've been hearing debbie-mail from marlene, so i sent debbie
mail saying (among other unrelated things) that she shouldn't
feel obligated to feel bad about you, because she seems to have
gotten into that way of thinking.  at least, that's what i think
has made her be so these days.  

i don't mean to jump off and start talking about debbie when
you're just trying to read your mail.  i figure 'nuff said
less'n you're just bursting with a brief question.

Racing action!  I see you've come up for air (or am I on a sensitive
topic?).
