Which three are you taking?

Last night I walked out of Tressider Union at Stanford, and there was a
cold drizzle.  The woman I was with said "It's Bostoning."  But it's
super-Bostoning in Boston, I gather.

My back hurts all the time;  I don't know what's going on.  I took
aspirin continually for two days, it seemed to be healing, but now it
has started to hurt all the time again.  Maybe I'll go get my massage
Wednesday night.

Bruce McHenry called me up and we're supposed to have dinner in Palo
Alto Thursday night.  I'm not thrilled, but I'm not scared either.

If you ever meet Dan Weld's Margaret, will you write me a description?
I'm curious.
I like Dan, and wonder what he's gotten himself into.

What's up?  How are classes?  I understand the weather is pretty
miserable out there, but I would give a small part of my left arm to be
there.  That's easy for her to say, I can see you thinking, she doesn't
have to take classes.  However, it's raining here too.

Much to my amazement, Patrick sent me a note.  I wonder what provoked
that---perhaps just being in Cambridge and being dislocated.  Perhaps it
somehow seems safe, perhaps it's just habit.  I'm not sure what I think,
but I was very impressed with his attitude about school.  I hope it
works out well.... 
I do believe that it is possible to be more or less happy in school.

Well, maybe you should take volleyball.  But my personal opinion is that
the thing you probably want to do with one of these asian women is have a
full-blown relationship, and a volleyball court won't be the place that will
help you start something like that.  Instead you'll bump into things because
you'll be looking at them.  I'm convinced that the only thing people who play
volleyball do is bump into things.

Leigh --

OK, your on blues.dis in advance for the summer ...

Some current writings are a chapter in Chang's VISUAL LANGUAGE book, out now
from Plenum Press ... assume you boxer guys should have a copy around or be
getting one, not the greatest book and my chap fits right in, but it is in the
viz lang/envir area. Also a paper from the TX conf on group work -- better
paper, but very viz so dont e-mail well. I can send you a paper copy, or Tom
Malone (biz school i think but you know his hacker tho i can't remember his
name) was there and has thje proceedings.

Yes, am very interested in alternatives to Symbolics (hoping Coral will set us
all free in the long run). I think the easy interim answer to portability is
to be extorted by Lucid rather than Symbolics ... believe Lucid guarantees
window portability across bitmapped hardware (includes RT's ...). Also, I hear
Lucid might suport News, Goslings PostScript like thing. Of course, you guys
have political reasons to go with X, and i guess each has advantages. For
current Lucid info, you should msg my friend Wade Hennesey
(WADE@SUSHI.STANFORD.EDU) -- he worked on the VAX port this summer for them
and will tell you what he can of hot news.

i've recently brought scheme up on an IBM-PC/RT under the Project
Athena version of the BSD-UNIX. The only changes i've had to make
in order to port it from Athena's Ultrix were to the word size
parameters and a define for `ibm032' in "config.h". 
My sense that it is in deed working comes from using an X-based
2-d graphics system, which ported without modification.

I have however noticed that a few things are broken.
DUMP-WORLD is one of them. Does anyone have a verification suite which
would be a better means than ideosyncratic aplications to establish
the functionality.

BROWNVILLE JUNCTION, Maine [Real Man town name] -- A Brownville
Junction [Real] man was treated at a local hospital for bites to his
hand and leg [Real Man injuries] after he climbed into roadside bushes
in pursuit [Real Man activity] of an injured coyote [Real Man animal].
Authorities said Philip Andrews [Phil, a Real Man name], 32, was 
returning home after a day of ice fishing [Real Man activity] at
Seboomook Lake [Indian names are Real Man, too] when his truck [Real
Man vehicle] hit a coyote that was standing in the road.  Andrews
found that the coyote had suffered a broken back and other injuries
[Real Man diagnostics] and decided the humane thing to do was kill the
animal [Real Man decision].  Meanwhile, the coyote crawled off the
road and under some bushes and tree limbs.  Andrews drew his hunting
knife [Real Man accessory] and crawled into the brush after the animal
[Real Man activity], which bit him several times on the hand and leg
[Real Man occupational hazard].  Andrews succeeded in killing the
coyote with his knife [Real Man activity].  A local game warden
determined that the coyote was not rabid. (UPI)

I recently ran a test of ExCl vs Lucid's foreign function calling.
David Oster had the good grace to send a copy to Franz asking if they were
going to make their foreign function interface any faster so I thought you
might want to see the results...

Fateman (who is not exactly disinterested in this matter) asked me if I used
the same C code for each example.

common lisp for the Suns we will use.  The problem is that we can't get

Jeremy,

Great letter.  I like the focus on seeing what the support boundaries are for Boxer in the area of hypertext.  I am interested in how far ports can cover
the linking needs of an idea-processer.  See you this weekend for awok and woll
party.

Leigh -- nice to chat with you again after this time. assume the boxer
stuff for Andy is in CL on SUN's (i at least am tired of being extorted
by Symbolics, but it's hard to find an alternative).

BTW, took the liberty of adding you to blues.dis, which will get you
also on boogie.dis, the mailing list for the band at the party.

cheers, f

Thank you for calling--Susan commented that you knew me well, and I had
to concur.
Susan also told me that Michael had told her that you were welcome there
anytime.  Funny he didn't tell you that, but perhaps he doesn't know
what his life will be like in June and July.  Or perhaps he is just like
that--- as with Mare-in.  I said "Susan, have you ever noticed that
Michael doesn't seem to, well, say things."  She said "What do you
mean?"  I said "It's not that he's deceptive, it's just that, well,
maybe there's more to him than he lets on."  She said, "That, of
course."

Wendy arrived today, for a couple of days.  She says it's snowing like
crazy in Cambridge.  I'm a little bit jealous, and hope that you don't
find it unpleasant.  Enjoy it for me, ok?

Today I listened to a Kate Bush tape that Patrick had given me---it made
me sad when I took it out of the case, when I saw his handwriting, and I
thought about how maybe he's in Cambridge too now.   I thought about how
many things he'd taught me to love, but also about the things that I
can't love.  And it made me feel even more exiled to think of all my
dearest friends out there in Cambridge, maybe together even, and I
couldn't even belong among them if I were there.  Well, in any case, I
miss you.

It's raining cats and dogs here.

bc...

    Belated new years greetings.
    
    The current status of the ALIFE workshop is as follows:
    
      1) date of the workshop will be Sept. 21-25, 1987. Any
         problems with the new date?
    
      2) location will probably be at the Oppenheimer Study Center
         at Los Alamos Labs.
       
      3) Sponsors so far are CNLS (who are putting up $15K) and
         possibly the Santa Fe Institute (negotiations are now
         in progress to fold the ALIFE wkshp in with their month-long
         workshop on Computational Biology.)
       
       
    The invitations are going out this week. Don't touch that dial!
    
    
    Stay tuned ..... Chris
    
    PS - are Tech reports on Vivarium out yet?

   I have been told that it is not possible to remotely log in to 
   a Bitnet machine from Arpa and vice versa.  Is this true?

Yes. For the most part, you can't even go from bitnet machine to
bitnet machine. You need a special kind of interface.

   And what about file transfer?  Will any interface work between the
   nets? 

Yes. Use Mail.

The XX account even went aaway for a while, but I got it back.  The
password is the thing you type to EMACS after you change your terminal
type (without the altmodes, of course).  Though you probably don't need it since
you have an account on XX.

If you don't get a reply from GZ about the privs, you might want to talk to Gumby.
I'm in Berkeley for the rest of this month, so I can't really do anything.
I
'm sorry I didn't answer your message; I don't remember it actually.
I've been consulting and studenting and such things.

I used to have operator privs on this account for hacking at EMACS and
other Tops-20 Utilities.  Would either of you know why they were
removed, and if they could please be restored.  With the account
EMACS-HACKERS changing password on me many months ago, and not getting
answers from either of you on what the new password was, I managed to
get an account on MIT-XX under my own name, so I finally can get back
in touch with this lab and some AI research.
	If possible, could you please restore the privs, and if not,
forward this message to the appropriate personnel.  Many thanks for
all and any help.

SUMMARY OF BUG MEETING

For those of you who didn't get the opportunity to join in this
momemtous occasion, we have officially named the meeting that was the
Boxer class last semester,  the Boxer Users Group (BUG).  But
seriously...

About 7 people showed up yesterday, which is pretty good considering I
forgot to make a poster.  We discussed our interests and how we'd like
to focus them this semester.

There appeared to be four piles of interests:

Hypertext/Writing -- Mike Sipusic and Susan Newman
Teaching Math -- Jack Smith and probably Laurie Edwards
Boxer Editor Applications -- Jeremy, Ted and Tim Larson
Boxer Manual/Tutorial -- Don Ploger.

To give everyone a basic intro,  I will do a demo next Thursday, and Don
will demo his Teach Boxer stuff the following Thursday.

The time after that is open-ended.

Here is my suggestion.  I thoroughly enthralled with many properties of
Boxer.  However I am concerned that its not good for anything.  MacWrite
edits text better, MacDraw draws better, and Logo is equally powerful
(though perhaps not at easy to learn).  

I think the vision of Boxer proscribes a programming language in which
programming is the standard means of interaction with the whole system.
I am concerned that our current Logo style language is not tuned to most
users interests -- that Boxer is a fine way to do anything you could do
in Logo, but will not give access to things you couldn't do in Logo.
This concern is particularly amplified by two recent incidents in which
people approached me (Tim and Ted) with perfectly reasonable projects
which you should be able to do in Boxer, and I was forced to say "Well I
don't think Boxer is up to that, you'd have to do a lot of writing in
LISP."  I know Andy will want to hear what exactly the problems are but
I don't have time to write them here.

Anyway, I propose we take a different tact from last semester.  Last
semester we asked ourselves questions like "What should search be like
in Boxer? -- nitty-gritty design issues at a deep and general level.  I
propose that instead we start this semester with the projects that
people want to do and ask ourselves two questions:  

How can we do these things in Boxer?
What should the Boxer language be like to support these things?

Of course, an underlying question is "Do we want to support these
projects in Boxer?"  I think the answer is yes -- We want to display
flowcharts, simulations, etc.  which are at the heart of these projects.

Everyone is welcome to BUG meetings.

5608 Tolman
4-5 pm Thursday

p.s.  What should we do about regular Boxer meetings?  I propose forking
off into BIG and BUG (Boxer Implementors Group and Boxer Users Group).
Maybe a third possibility is BOG (Boxer Organizers Group) or BEG (Boxer
Equipment Group) ???

p.p.s The only remaining possibility is BAG and I think it must be
rejected on the principle that it introduces a new object to Boxer.

The twenex world recently discovered that an RP0x which gets a header
compare error (HCE) without getting a header CRC error (HCRC) at the
same time may need to have a recalibrate operation done rather than
just a recenter and retry type thing. Otherwise the head ends up
mispositioned till it eventually slams into the stops (which either
fixes it or breaks it but good).

Apparently this is contrary to what the "manual" says.

I don't know what ITS does in this case. Just writing it down for
the record.

I spoke with Sussman.  We will hire you as UROP for the spring.  You
can do ANYTHING YOU WANT.  The idea is that this is a way to get you
some extra money without taking up studying time.  It might be a good
idea to do some scheme hacking that is 6.003-related.  When you get
back, write up a UROP proposal and give it to Gerry to sign.

I ran into Braida and he says that he doesn't expect students in the
lab class to put in as much work as he expects to in 6.001.  He also
said it would be nice to take his lab in conjunction with 6.003
because they have some signal-processing software to play with.

How are you and Ed doing?

It is more than a good thing. It is necessary. MIT wants to know where
that equipment is, and asks that we keep inventories. Betty usually
keeps it. But she's been having trouble since things change so
rapidly.

Please, folks, tell us what you have at home.

I've witnessed a fair deal of confusion leading to frustration both
with respect to "where did it go", and "when did this break, and how".
Presently, all one can do is ask around until one gets a feasible
answer, act on it, and hope that it's approximately correct.

Wouldn't it be a Very Good Thing to have a list, on line, of all of
Vivarium's (major) pieces of equipment, their status, and their

Subject:  PEEK shouldn't ever PCLSR anyone
To: BUG-COMSAT@AI.AI.MIT.EDU, BUG-ITS@AI.AI.MIT.EDU
In-reply-to: Msg of Wed 21 Jan 1987  00:25 EST from Rob Austein <SRA at XX.LCS.MIT.EDU>
Message-ID: <143202.870122.ALAN@AI.AI.MIT.EDU>

After fixing PEEK to not needlessly PCLSR device servers a few days ago, I
have been periodically watching COMSAT and DQDEV on MC waiting to catch
them in the act of getting hung up.  This afternoon I found them in the
wedged state and was able to figure out what causes the problem.  The
problem has nothing to do with the BOJ/JOB code, and is not a bug in DQDEV.
Actually it is an apparently long-standing timing error in the
implementation of .HANG.  

Specifically, when you did (as DQDEV does)

	TRNN AC,%FLAG
	 .HANG

the code for .HANG knew that the TRNN instruction could never skip unless
the C(AC) changed, and since nothing can change a job's accumulators
without PCLSRing the job, .HANG could simply hang forever.  This is all
well and good, except .HANG neglected to run the instruction once itself to
be certain that AC hadn't been changed by an interrupt routine that ran
-between- the TRNN and the .HANG.

I have assembled an ITS with the fix and I will test it the next time I get
a chance.

Subject: Message passing in PETWORLD


This may seem somewhat confused, but it almost makes sense. But now I
am sleeping. If you have questions, comments, or problems, please feel
free to ask, argue, or harangue me. I'm looking for input on this
plan, since I am not a real Object Lisp/message passing wizard.


A discussion of the objects in each world; what each object can do and
what can be done to it. Also what is stored in each object. You'll
need to be familiar with stuff from PETWORLD to understand some
things. 

The Clock:

The clock controls the passage of time in the world. It will send
messages to the world to do things. We describe below the
LOOK-THINK-DO loop. The world will also send messages to other units
(like the screen display unit, for example) and look for keyboard
input, etc. (i.e. I don't know, really)

The first phase is LOOK. Each object is given a chance to construct a
list of things it can perceive. For instance, it might filter the set
of all objects in the world to remove the things too far away to be
seen/smelt/... This coresponds to a low-level sensory thing, the
object's intelligence has nothing to do with it. Only the rules of
what the object physically can perceive are used.

The next phase is THINK. This is the part where the object's "brain"
code is run. The brain is given the perceptions as an input and must
produce a "move" as an output. This is an intention to act which is
completely specific, not contingent. No further thinking may be
performed.

The last phase is DO. Each object performs its "move" by sending
messages to the objects of these moves. This might cause more messages
to be sent, but in the end it will all settle out, because each
message is part of the original move. 

The Display:

The display is a unit which gets told by the clock to REDISPLAY. Then
it asks the world for an OBJECTLIST. It then magically makes something
nice happen on the screen.

The World:

The world is an object. It will deal with the physics of interobject
interactions. It will have a ranking of all the different objects by
class. It will also have a hashing of where things are.

Reactions:
CREATE	Startup the world. Will need some input info, and will try to
	do a nice job, putting things not too close together or far
	apart. Needs more spex.
LOOK	Tell each pet to look around. 
THINK	Tell each pet to decide what to do next.
DO	Tell each pet and plant to do the action it's decided to do.
FORGET(name) After something dies, we should remove it from the world
	to get it garbage collected, etc.
NEWPLANT Make a new plant somewhere on the board that is the right
	distance from everything else.
OBJECTLIST Return a list of objects in the world.

Rocks:

Actions:
Rocks don't do much of anything. They have no intellect, no ability to
move about. If a pet LIFTS them, they tell the pet to PAYLOAD them.
Then, whenever the pet moves, it will tell the rock to MOVETO where
the pet goes. 

Reactions:
EXIST	why not
DIE	Send a FORGET message to the world.
MOVETO	does it
EAT	Return-call ATTACK
ATTACK	Return-call ATTACK
STOMP	Return-call ATTACK
LIFT	Return-call PAYLOAD

Plants:

Plants have an internal variable *meal-count*, 

Actions:
Plants will never initiate an action.

Reactions:
EXIST	ok
DIE	Send a FORGET message to the world. Then send a NEWPLANT 
	message to the world.
DO	increment *meal-count* by *growth-factor*
EAT	Decrement *meal-count*. Send back a FEED message. If
	*meal-count* goes negative, send self a DIE message.
ATTACK	Send self a DIE message
STOMP	Send self a DIE message, Return-send a MOVE-TO message.
LIFT	Send self a DIE message

Animals:

Actions:
Pets use up food as they go. Therefore, during the THINK phase, if the
pet finds its hunger greater then the maximum allowable amount, it
skips the user thinking, and instead sets the pending action to DIE. 

When an animal intends to move somewhere, it firsts sends the
coordinates of where it intends to move to the World, which returns
nil or the name of the object at that point (collision detection
insert here). If nil, the pet sends to itself (or just does) a MOVETO
to get there. If a name is returned, the pet sends a STOMP message to
the name. (The recipient causes the pet to move or not.) 

Reactions:
EXIST	ok
DIE	This is complex.
MOVETO	ok, do it.
LOOK	Do perception code. Set up rankings internally. Set *fear*.
	Decrement *damage*. Increment *hunger*.
THINK	If hunger>max, send self a DIE message. Else, run the 
	user's brain code. Set *intended-action* to the result.
	We are going to want to hook in our dynamic brain display.
DO	Interpret the intended action. 
EAT	Return-send an ATTACK message.
ATTACK	Change *damage* state variable.
STOMP	Return-send an ATTACK message.
LIFT	Return-send an ATTACK message.
PAYLOAD	unknown, nil, error?
FEED	Decrement *hunger*.

Lately whenever I try to telnet to OZ from my 3600, the request times
out and I get an error menu on my screen.  This happens whether or not
OZ is up and even when it's not very loaded.  When I tell it to keep
trying, it almost invariably succeeds immediately.  What I assume is
happening is that the 3600 waits for N milliseconds and OZ replies 
after N+100 milliseconds.  Maybe the timeout could be increased?

Total Music, MusicWorks(sic?)...  All I have seen in a long time is
Performer.  Anyone know anything about this?  

Supplementally, if anyone personally owns any other sequencing programs,
I'd like to borrow them sometime to see what they're like.

Thanks
