Subject: this and that

The supernova's jsut starting to become visible.  Mostly you can see
that there's a star in the Greater Magellanic Cloud, rather than
there being just a smudge.  I hope it gets brighter before I leave.

That's good about 6.003.  It does move at a tremendous rate.  By the
way, please do me a favor and see Siebert and ask him to send me mail
(to Hal@OZ) about how he thinks things are going.

If I were you, I'd make sure that Jock not only signs the agreement,
but that you cash the check and get a Treasury Agent to inspect the
bills to verify that they are legal tender, before doing anything
more for Terrapin.  By the way -- are there any plans to do anything
with the Apple Double-Plus-Good?  (i.e., the 2GS).

Don't worry about Gerry.  Every so often he gets into one of these
"it really was a bad idea for god to create the universe and it's all
my fault" moods.  (This is an occupational handicap of having a
Jewish mother.)  My own rule of thumb is not to worry unless Chris is
unhappy.

As for your specific quesitons:

  Should I go to Gerry and ask for something to do?

No.  Just pick something that you want to do.  As far as I'm
concerned, the point of the UROP is to get you some money for the
semester with not much work.  (Don't feel guilty -- we don't pay you
enough.)  Doing something for 6.003 would be nice.  I've been trying
to get someone to hook up an instrument (A/D) to a Bobcat for a few
months now, but it seems to run into HP Unix problems.  It would be
really great if you could figure out how to do this.  Andy Berlin
knows about the board and the current state of the problem with Unix,
I think.  Anything that allows stuff to be read in in real time and
accessed by Scheme would be wonderful.

      Should I go ask Chris if he wants help on the compiler?

Probably not, unless you want to hack it this summer.  I was hoping
you would want to go out to Berkely and Boxerize.  Let me know if not.

     Do you have any suggestions about what I can do to make Gerry
     happy?

Yes.  Figure out a way to move the stars in the night sky, so that
they form a new constellation that spells out "IT'S NOT YOUR
FAULT, SUSSMAN."
