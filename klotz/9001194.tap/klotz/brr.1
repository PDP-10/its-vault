I'm unable to sleep and trying to find you on one of these stupid machines
and failing at it.  My leg hurts.  I misgauged the coefficient of friction
between the floor and my shoe earlier -- the floor had just been mopped with
something and was very sticky and I was running down the hall and boy did I
fucking fall down, for the first time in years, and though I neatly caught
myself and kept from breaking my nose, I banged the bloody hell out of my
knee.

What the hell are we going to do about this Logo thing?  I am psyched to work
on it, but not in Japan for three months.  I want to be very rich, too.  My
knee hurts.  Let's start a corporation.  We can import French sixteen-year-old
girls with brown hair and blue eyes and fair skin with freckles to make coffee
for us, except that neither of us drinks coffee anymore, so they can make hot
chocolate for us, and smile like only French sixteen-year-old girls can.  They
will be unable to resist our offers of summer jobs, because none of them ever
do anything for the summer but go to the south of France and lie on the beach
with nearly nothing on and sunburn their breasts, and their little brothers are
obnoxious and their mothers sun their breasts too, but their mothers don't look
as good as their sixteen-year-old daughters anymore so they feel bad and start
affairs with French bachelors who pretend to be philosophical ex-Foreign Legion
paratroopers (rien, rien, je ne regrette pas rien), but are actually elementary
school teachers.  Sometimes, if the mothers have very bad taste, they have
affairs with young Italian gadabouts who turn out to be Moroccan migrant
workers who don't have families, and have time on their hands and nothing to
do.  This makes the sixteen-year-old girls' fathers unhappy, so they get drunk
at night and yell at the waiters and embarass their daughters, who feel like
they would absolutely rather DIE or do ANYTHING but be with these PEOPLE who
just happen to be family and have brought them here to this DREARY place where
-- ow, dammit!  don't bite me, you little pig! -- your little brother follows
you around and there's nothing to do but lie on the beach and look at the young
men who only want to ogle your breasts even if they pretend to be talking about
spearfishing anyway.

All this being the case, they will be completely unable to resist our offers
of employment in fashionable Boston, especially if we laugh at them a lot and
act like gangsters, and they will have small breasts, tanned and firm and
full, like dusky peaches.  My knee won't hurt, and everything will be foggy
and slightly out of focus, as if someone had rubbed vaseline on the outside
of a skylight filter before taking the pictures.

I can never sleep at night any more.  I lie there, and listen to my stomach
making noise, and my stomach notices me listening, so it makes more noise,
and everything is generally pretty unpleasant.  Eventually I fall asleep, but
by then it's late, so I don't get up until quite late in the morning, so I'm
not sleepy the following night at bedtime.  I also have a sore throat.

I do want to write this version of Logo.  I find it difficult to talk to Mr.
Hasegawa about it, because I have so much trouble understanding him.  I wish
you could do most of the remaining talking to him.
