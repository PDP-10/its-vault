Easter brings them out of the woodwork.
Guillermo, I understand: the words hold for him;
but Henry Wu?  They plan for midnight mass:
Shall we go to Harvard?

This year the baskets are plastic.
Would Laurel like a hollow scenic egg?  I
used to eat them, the sharp sugar ones.
The dyed eggs rotted on my shelf.

A week later, in any park, you can find
one or two, like mushrooms after rain.
