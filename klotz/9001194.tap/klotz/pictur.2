I've been taking pictures lately, did I tell you?  There's a parking lot
near my house, your old house, Libby's house, that has an arrangement of
two-score pastel bathroom lavatories.  They're behind a fence and next to
some old fiberglass bathtubs filling with mosquito water and leaves.  I
took some pictures of them, or some part of them, so that the picture
gives the impression of a boundless field of pastel sinks.

Unfortunately, it was overcast, and the color saturation is not what one
would like.  So I got some film that's supposed to be good for overcast
days and I'm planning to go back.  I'll keep you posted.  I also took
pictures of flow-flows and things like that, but they're not nearly so
interesting.  What is interesting is to see who likes the flowers and who
likes the sinks when I show them the pictures in that order.

I got a picture-postcard from Noyuri, two actually: one from Hong Kong and
one from Shanghai.  From Hong Kong, she writes that there are lots of
people, and lots of traffic, and that she bought a pair of earrings, a
pair of shoes, and a dress (all Italian), and that the food is good and
"wish you were here," punctuated with a small red heart.  The picture, a
typical street scene, is from an area of Hong Kong about as interesting
as, say, Central Square.  It is, though, full of red and blue signs,
double-deckers, and green streetcars.

The postcard from Shanghai (Hangzhow, the enlightened say) says "China is
very dirty everywhere.  Remember Chinatown in Boston?  Here is several
times as dirty.  There are a lot of bad mannered Chinese.  Food &
historical places are the only good things in China.  I understand how
difficulty staying in underdeveloping countries.  I remember Yumiko-san.  I
don't want to fisit China in a few years."  I gather Noyuri didn't like
the shopping.

Yumiko graduated with Noyuri from the Ed school and went to Zimbabwe.  She
took a picture of Noyuri and me at her graduation; I happened to find it
in my desk today.  It is in a Harvard food tent on the Ed. School grounds,
and Noyuri is in the center of the picture.  Behind her, like some French
impressionist cafe, are spotted tables of men and women with sharp noses
softened by the distance, laughing and talking.  The frilled edge of the
tent blocks off the sunlight.

I am visible just off to the right, in profile, out of focus.  Noyuri is
wearing her graduation gown, the color of mourning.  Her hair is long on
the sides and joins seamlessly with the gown, although a black butterfly
hairpin holds it off her forehead on one side.  A few strands have
separated and hang down long on her cheek.  She's holding a paper coffee
cup on the table with both hands, as if it needed control, as if it were
something she needed to hold on to.  Although she's facing more or less
ahead, her eyes are turned towards me, half white and half dots of black.
I might be looking down at her hands, at the way the silver band catches
the light.  Her lips are full and slightly parted, but not red.  Her
eyebrows are troubled, her nose round and small.
