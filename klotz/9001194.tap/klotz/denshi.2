I've been reading an article in the May 1987 issue of Bit magazine called
"Computer Science Guidance," a round-table discussion with five
professors.  Among other issues, takes up computation environments at
Todai and other universities.

It seems that Todai has about 600 Fujitsu FM-16 beta personal computers
now for about 10,000 first- and second-year students, and that they are
connecting things up with Ethernet.  There is a big Hitachi computer
(M682H, 32MB) that is centrally located.  When the department passed out a
questionnaire on network use, they found that most students could think of
no of the Ethernet but connection to the central computer.

Prof. Haruhisa Ishida (a comparatively young fellow, judging by his
picture) explained the questionanaire results by saying that students had
little experience with "radiative" networks, and said that he expects them
to wake up to the uses of electronic mail for communicating with "the lab
next door."

Prof. Ken Hirose of Waseda, the senior participant in the talk, then
proceeded to complain that students would use the networks to exchange
information about homework!

Ishida pointed out that people have begun to use electronic mail for
peer-group commnication, sending mail like "Wanna go eat?"  Hirose replied
with something like, "Well, as long as it's limited to that..."

Now, I figure that electronic mail and network communication has spawned a
firmly established subculture in the U.S. and to some extent in other
Western countries.  Ways of interacting and traditions have already built
up, and though there may be differences between USENET conventions and
intra-university or Arpanet styles of communication, there is pretty much
a common mode of interaction.

In our computer subculture, it's quite easy to talk to people without
knowing who they are or what their status is: it is not unusual to see a
message interchange on a mailing list between, say, a sophomore and a
Turing award winner.  

People quite freely speak their minds much more than in other "printed"
media.  Those who are reserved in conversation can be exuberant and
opinionated (some might even say "flaming") in mail.  Since people
frequently have no interaction with their correspondents other than
electronic mail, their relationships are defined solely through that
medium.

As electronic mail communication at a university level is just starting in
Japan there is an excellent opportunity to watch how it develops.  How
will Japanese culture adapt the medium, and how will it be changed by it?
What conventions will develop?  Will students and faculty be able to
communicate in a less constrained fashion than in conversation?  Can we
make predictions on the basis of a comparison of, say, amateur radio in
the U.S. and Japan?

The radio analogy is tempting; in both countries, ham radio operators talk
to faraway people they don't know on a first-name basis.  In computer
mail, though, there is generally more structure (and higher bandwidth).
In electronic mail, people can join mailing lists and participate in
discussions on fairly well-defined topics; whereas in ham radio, the
medium itself is the main attraction, secondary to any other interests the
oprators share.  Also, I believe (though I don't know for sure) that ham
radio in Japan is much more a hobby enjoyed by adolescents than in the
U.S.

The Japanese make much of the subtlety of their social interaction.
Japanese who attend college abroad find themselves at a disadvantage,
being unschooled in the finer arts of both sides of second-guessing.  Even
in the comparatively brash world of American culture, extra-linguistic
communication is important.  Computer users have had to approximate such
clues as tone of voice and context (i.e., knowing your correspondent) with
devices expressible concisely in ASCII text.  The UNIX happy/sad faces
:-), the MIT undergraduate *FLAME* markers, and Scribe or TeX @ital{} or
\satire{} environments are the ones that come to mind immediately.  What
sorts of textual devices will develop to represent extra-linguistic clues
in Japanese electronic mail?

Written Japanese and spoken Japanese are much more different than written
and spoken English.  Will people adopt a written or spoken style in
messages?  Even among friends, letters usually begin with ritualized
greetings and comments about the season, and are written in at least the
polite conversational style.  Japanese frequently leave telephone
answering messages in the polite style to people with whom they normally
converse familiarly.  However, the sample short messages that Prof. Ishida
sites are in a jocular, intimate mode.  What sorts of rules will govern
the choice of politeness and respect level in electronic mail?  Perhaps
Japan will develop a FINGER/WHOIS database with more detailed information
than the Arpanet spec.

Prof. Richard Samuels in the MIT/Japan Science and Technology Program and
his graduate students (notably Monica Strauss) have studied research
collaboration and the flow of information in Japanese research facilities.
The kind of widespread access to electronic mail that we have in the U.S.
will have some effect on the paradigms and social structures these
researchers have found.  Will electronic mail be absorbed into Japanese
culture absorb like countless other foreign advances, or will it have a
profound impact on inter-level interaction in university and research
facilities?
