Adam's Curse meticulously adheres to a five-foot line, but non-iambic feet
abound.  The stanzas are broken like paragraphs, at changes in speaker or
thought.  Although the basic rhyme scheme is the couplet, stanza breaks
sometimes occur in between the two lines.  The rhyme is carried across
these breaks only weakly or not all, but at the last stanza break it is
quite strong.  Even within a stanza, there are places where the rhyme is
not exact, especially in the last two couplets.  End-stopped lines and
enjambment are about equally common, but not placed so as to create a
regularity of extended lines.  Yeats uses contractions and, for the most
part, ordinary words in the poem.  On the whole the effect is remarkably
conversational for its form; it is in the quotes from the poets own
conversation that are the furthest from ordinary speech in syntax and
diction.

Because Adam ``listened to the voice of his wife'' and ate of the forbidden
tree, he and his descendents were cursed to suffer pain, to work, to eat
wild plants, and finally to die and return to the soil from which they
came.  Although is isn't mentioned in Genesis iii.17-19, Eve was cursed to
bear children in pain, and their descendents also to commit the act
necessary for propagation.

The title of the poem, however, refers specifically to Adam's curse, and
not to the more generic fall, a more widely described subject.  However,
the sexual act does require two people, and Adam and his descendents are
required to participate.  Adam's curse, through the gain of knowledge,
brings imperfection (through human needs and death) to the world,
and makes love something which must deal with this real, imperfect workd.

Adam's Curse is a description of a meeting involving a man and two women.  The
speaker describes himself as a poet, and addresses the poem to one of the
women, with whom he was in love.  In describing their conversation he
quotes himself and the other woman, a close friend of his beloved, but
does not quote the woman he loved.  The conversation was about poetry, but
the reported sections deal with poetry and labor, woman and labor, and
love and labor.

The poem is a love poem, and written as from a lover to his beloved, but
it is an unusual love poem in several ways.  The presence of a third
person keeps it from being a close, one-on-one declaration of love.  The
poet criticizes certain expressions of love as being idle and belabored,
yet he realizes that he, too, suffered from wanting to love in ``the old
high way.''  Rather than dealing with either the feeling of falling in love
or with the different, more stable emotion of continuing to be in love,
the view of love in the poem is that it is difficult, imperfect, and after
a certain point not something that lives of its own accord.

In his first quote, the poet says that writing poetry is hard work, and
that the poet is not the idler that the ``noisy set'' of bankers,
schoolmasters, and clergyman think he is.  In other words, poets are not
exempted from work, nor by extension from the curse of Adam; thus even
poets are not isolated from the profane aspects of love.

Though writing poetry is work, it should not, in the reading, seem like
work; rather, it should seem ``a moment's thought.''  That is to say a
poem expresses an idea that is not wholly communicable in another way.
When a poem comes together in the mind of the reader, it should engender
one or more thoughts, atomic in the sense that they are not summarizable
or divisible.


W. V. O. Quine, in {\em Word and Object}, argues that all communication
with words is imperfect in that one speaker can never know what another is
thinking or means when he uses a word, because what a word means to a
person is the sum of all her experiences and connections with that word.
In a practical sense, people communicate well enough, but when the task is
to communicate certain kinds of feeling or emotion, we make special uses
of language to form poetry.  In poetry there are all manner special
devices to form non-logical connections between words.  The poet can draw
on images and shared experience and connect them in subtle ways more
freely and with less logical justification than in prose in the effort to
describe ``a moment's thought.''  An understanding of, for instance, the
poet's choice to use certain words can be crucial to the understanding of
the effect of a poem.

Yeats' choice of the occupations for the people constituting the world in
the first stanza was for an intersection of reasons.  At a simple level,
bankers represent a no-nonesense, establishment occupation and set of
attitudes.  Schoolmasters, though their job is to teach, sometimes stifle
learning and creativity.  Clergymen are quite clearly tied to the
religious framework of the poem.  At a slightly deeper, less conscious
level, clergymen, though they once fulfilled (and still do to a lesser
degree) the role of therapist of the psyche, saw the world through the
stained-glass windows of the church.  In the resulting staid, pious,
strict world, there was little room for exploring the meaning of love
through poetry.

Since Adam's fall, it has been possible to talk about love only when it is
``compounded of high courtesy.''  The ``beautiful old books'' to which the
poet refers undoubtedly include writers like Shakespeare, whose depictions
of love certainly allowed problems and conflicting emotions, but centered
more on its positive aspects, or the search for them: the {\em carpe diem}
motif and the role of time are strong in his work.  There is no room for
such as ``...and yet we'd grown/As weary-hearted as that hollow moon.''
Through the schoolmaster and because of the connections of school and
Shakespeare, by far the poet most people remember from school days, the
``high way'' of thinking about love that Shakespeare and company espoused is
connected with the people who disparage the work of the poet.

Through the device of putting both the lovers with their ``idle trade''
in the past tense (and indeed using those two words), and then at the end
of the poem looking at his feelings for his own beloved in the past, Yeats
strengthens the connection between these two sets of lovers.

The three people in the poem, grow quiet at the mention of love.  The
understanding that love can bring pain (foreshadowed by the ``heartache''
men will find) is certainly one reason why they are contemplative.
Another reason is that the three grow self-conscious of talking about
perceptions of love which do not correspond to their own, and grow silent
in the face of the futility of trying to talk about these intensely
personal, intricate meanings and conflicting ideas.  Here, the silence in
the poem contributes meaning.

In the silent stanza, there is no thought and no conversation.  The people
barely appear; the concentration is on heavens: the sun, the sky, the
moon, and the stars.  This stanza serves to separate the external from the
internal, the reported conversation from the expressed thought.  It also
sets a mood for the last stanza and introduces the moon as a symbol of
worn thin by time and experience.

Very little of the poem to this point has concerened the women with whom
the poet is in love.  He talks mostly about that woman's ``close friend.''
When the speaker talks about the friend, he describes her as ``that
beautiful mild woman'' and praises her voice, saying ``many a one shall
find out all heartache'' on account of it.  When she speaks in response to
the poet, she talks of women laboring to be beautiful, like poets must
labor to write.  But like poetry, the beauty of women seem uncontrived.
The attention paid to this second woman make it seem that the poet is
almost in love with her, too.  Given the religious (though not pious)
undercurrent, though, it seems likely the three people are more like the
trinity than a love triangle.

The last stanza of the poem is devoted to the beloved.  There, the poet
reveals that his thoughts about the beloved are for her ears only, with
the ears hearkening back to poetry as means of expression.  This stanza is
the only place we find direct evidence that the poet loves (or loved) the
person to whom this poem is addressed.  The next two lines, taken by
themselves, present a poignant expression of love; however, in the context
of the poem and its previous denigrations of that kind of love, that way
of talking about love, it imparts an even more bittersweet quality, soon
borne out by the weary-heartedness and the hollowness that time and
experience have brought on.

The ``old high way'' calls back both the ``idle'' lovers of the past and
the kind of love they read about, and the kind of love that might have
existed before the fall.  The kind of love for which the poet strives is
impossible because of Adam's curse.
