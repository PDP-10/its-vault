An American Engineer in Tokyo 			by Wayne W. Lui
						Feb. 1986 in Tokyo, Japan.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I. Introduction
   ------------
	"Gaijin: an alien; a foreigner." Sample sentence: "To purify the
country of undesirable gaijins." This definition was found in the
authoritative "Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary." From the sample
sentence, the word gaijin, unfortunately, seems to possess a shade of
xenophobia. But like it or not, in October, 1984, I arrived in Japan through
the sponsorship of the AEA (American Electronics Association) and was instantly
besieged by my new-found indentity. It was, and still is, a bitter-sweet 
experience. The following is my personal statement on my experience working 
in Japan.

	I was put to work in the Central Laboratory of NEC located in 
Miyazaki, Kawasaki --- a quiet residential area just outside of Tokyo. On
my first day at work, a company car was waiting for me at the train
station to take me directly to the door step of the Lab. In the next few
months, although there was no more chauffeuring, I was treated as no less
than a VIP. I liked working in Japan so much that I decided to extend my
contract with NEC for another year.

	After the carnival is over, after the mutual excitement is gone,
it was boredom and loneliness beyond description. It was then I was hit by
what people called "culture shock." It was anguish, frustration and pain.
Wandering aimlessly on the street after work seemed to be the only way to
kill time, while watching groups of people passing by me laughing their
heads off everywhere just reflected my own solemn solitude on this foreign
soil. I was, more than ever, ready to pack and leave.

	I was wrong, but glad that I was. After seeing two facets of Japan,
I was stirred. I then realized how ignorant I was about Japan. I was
expecting too much, and I was making all kinds of wrong assumptions about
the Japanese. Although I am anticipating more of these psychological,
tidal ups and downs, I chose to stay. Furthermore, from the other side of
the Pacific, I can see America in quite a different prospective. I can
see what I used to take for granted, for instance, and what America can
learn from Japan and vice versa. It is an opportunity I cannot afford
to miss.

	The next section of my report would be on my experiences working
for NEC during the past two years, in which the research methodology, the
management, the salary/promotion scheme and other miscellaneous items of
NEC will be discussed. It is followed by a brief conclusion.


II. The Gaijin Experience in NEC
    ----------------------------
A. Research Methodology
   --------------------
	Creativity seems to be the sole element that keeps research
activities going, and is thus treasured by most research institutes.
As far as the Central Lab of NEC is concerned, creativity seems, to me,
to be prohibited. One should not be surprised, however, in light of the
emphasis of conformity in Japan, and the popular Japanese proverb which
states roughly that if a nail sticks its head out too far, it should be
hammered down.

	Although creativity seems to be banned, it is certainly not
lacking. Recently, a colleague of mine came up with a theory to describe
the extremely complicated behavior of electrons in the modern ultra small
transistors. It may not be the ultimate theory. From the standpoint of a
research institute, however, he should at least be given a chance to
prove himself.

	After trying to convince all of his colleagues at his same level,
he had to sell his theory to at least three more levels of managers above
him. It is unfortunate to see that it did not take much hammering for this
nail to bend. It is sadder to contemplate the numerous Einsteins and Edisons
being hammered down in a similar fashion over the years.

	As a gaijin, the experience is particularly agonizing. Despite the
elementary contents of the paper which I presented at a local conference
last year, it is a result of months and months of heated debates and
arguments. At first, these seemed to be a gesture of sincerity and that
my paper needed to be improved, I was more than happy to listen to their
advice. As the questions and criticisms raised became more and more on the
unreasonable side --- and the compromises I offered were bluntly refused
--- head-on confrontation was my only solution. Whatever the outcome, they
seemed to have achieved what they first set out to do --- my initial
enthusiasm on research was half gone.

	On another occasion, I was told not to conduct research my own way.
The reason was being that other people, such as researchers in Hitachi or
Toshiba, are not doing it the way I was. It should not be surprising, however,
considering that people in the Lab spend substantial amount of time on
reading journals and papers rather than on creative thinking.

	Despite this unwritten prohibition of creativity, it is ironical
that everybody in the Lab has to file six or more patents a year as a rule.
In doing so, it is hoped to squeeze the last drop of juice out from the 
staff. It is sometimes rather mind-boggling to find how "creative" everybody
suddenly becomes by the end of the year when the deadline is near.

	Quantity is certainly not quality. Another purpose behind this rule
is to put an equal sign between these two Q's when it comes to patents. The
rule forces the average genius to patent what seems to be mundane and obvious
to everyone in the field --- including himself. Even if only a small
percentage of those patents get accepted, the management will have more
bargaining chips on the table when it comes to exchanging patent rights with
other companies such as IBM or AT&T, which own most of the basic patents in
semiconductor devices. Quantity is, finally, quality.

	A big leap forward may not be encouraged, but incremental
improvement is undoubtedly the strong point of the research methodology in
NEC. Not only engineers, but technicians, are encouraged to speak out as how
to improve the efficiency of his/her work station, no matter how insignificant
or trivial it may seem. To reinforce this, those who speak out will be
awarded with attention and recognition: a memorandum passing around the Lab
describing the new improvements, plus possibly a tin cup from the general
manager.

	Technology, to paraphrase Edison, is comprised of 1% physical
understanding of the real world --- which is generally know as Science
--- plus 99% dirty work to implement it. In NEC, that 99% of dirty work:
upkeep of the apparatus, smoothing of the work-flow, automation of repetitious
routines, for instance, are being taken care of by technicians, leaving
researchers free to make contributions in the field they know best.

	To keep the researchers informed, the library and information center
in the Lab is excellent. Once in a while, a stack of copies of tables of
contents from the latest publications will be passed around for everyone to
inspect. Copies of papers will readily be prepared by the librarians upon
request. Personally, I find it extremely convenient.

	Communication in the Lab is excellent too. In part, this is
attributed to the congested office where nothing can be hidden. Moreover,
the atmosphere is rather relaxing, and everyone is willing to discuss
his/her work any time. Information is very accessible. When most modern
technologies nowadays are becoming more and more cross-disciplinary, I find
this most important.

	A digression should be made here. It should be mentioned that
whenever there is an international conference, there always seems to be
someone from the Lab attending it. The reverse may not be true, however.
Currently, only Siemens, HP and AT&T are sending their engineers, who must
be fluent in Japanese, to attend some of the local conferences held in Japan.

	Once the attendee is back, the proceedings of the conference will be
passed around, and will be immediately placed in the library for others who
are interested. Moreover, he/she will have to prepare a talk to highlight
the papers presented at the conference. Information is distributed and
absorbed at the speed of light.

	On the other hand, if there is any new result, researchers in NEC
will present it at local conferences/workshops, held monthly, before they
will publish it or submit it to international conferences --- if they do so
at all. In between, it usually takes a few months before the material is
translated into English and reaches the hands of referees of the journal or
conference. It will be another few months before it appears in the West. The
process is dead slow, largely a result of the difference in fluency in each
other's language. Most Japanese engineers understand enough English to digest
the technical literature, while most engineers in America do not have the 
faintest idea of what Japanese is. This "trade deficit" in information can
only be balanced through language training, which takes time, or better
facilities to translate Japanese literature into English.

	Finally, if I had to, I would characterize the research methodology
in the NEC Lab as conservative and cautious. Resistance to new ideas exists
everywhere, but rarely more so than in NEC. It may be efficient, but it is
also numb to changes. Their recent success in the market place has also left
researchers rather chauvinistic about their own theories and results. Then
again, it could be the secret of their success. Nonetheless, the NEC Central
Lab has already proved itself as one of the most influential research 
institutes in Japan, let alone the world.

B. Management
   ----------
	There is a saying that the middle management in Japan is the cancer
of the system. On one hand, they need job security and therefore dare only
to make extremely cautious, if not ridiculously conservative moves. The
punishment of any wrongdoing is usually an exile to an unimportant post, which 
interprets into a dim career future, as Japanese employees are expected to
work for the same company for life. To advance, they cannot afford radical
and innovative moves.

	On the other hand, days of guaranteed promotion are gone. Surveys
show only one out of four of the new hires will be promoted to management
level. To be ahead of the others, the only way left is internal cannibalism
--- elimination of the others. Since trial and error is what research is all
about, those who try the hardest make most errors, and will be the first
to be eliminated. As a result, inertia is unnecessarily built up, and
momentum slowly dies down.

	Conservative moves and incremental improvement, however, have proved
to be the best approach for memory chip development. From the 16K-bit dRAM in
the late 1960's to today's 4M-bit dRAM, the development has been faithfully
following the Moore's curve, which predicts a doubling in integration level
about every two years. This approach has already shown its merits in the
recent enormous success Japanese companies enjoy in the semiconductor market.
This also perhaps explains why Japanese companies are not, until recently,
producing any microprocessor chips which requires innovative design.

	Another interesting aspect is that job assignment is determined
solely by the management, not by the individual. If the individual is not 
prepared for the task, he/she will be trained on the job. In general, no one
likes it. No one likes changes. In the long run, however, it turns out to
be advantageous to both the company and the individual. It is a process of
forced education.

	It is a well-known fact that the learning-curve climbs rapidly
initially but eventually levels off and saturates after a period of time.
After a few switches in job, as long as the individual stays on each job
long enough, the knowledge and experience gained is immense. He/she will
have a much broader exposure in the field, see the picture more clearly and
thus understand the mechanism of the whole machinery much better. It also
avoids the specialist syndrome, where everyone can see only his/her own tree
but misses the forest. Furthermore, the shuffling will also help the
management to identify each individual's special talent, and it will thus
be easier for them to streamline the work force.

	This big brother scheme may look efficient, but it does not 
guarantee job satisfaction. Most of the people I talked to admitted that they
are not quite satisfied with their present assignment. They think they can
do better. To let off steam, at the end of each year, everybody will be given
a chance to voice their dissatisfactions and complaints to the management by
filling out one gigantic form. Each of them will also have a chance to discuss
its contents with his superiors personally --- whether the management will
listen or not is another matter.

	Another feature of the management style in NEC is the unwritten rules.
For instance, although everyone is entitled to certain number of paid holidays
a year, no one is supposed to take more than two days off in a row, nor to
exhaust all holidays by the end of the year. Sick leaves will be counted
towards as paid holidays. Gaijins will not be allowed to attend conferences
abroad (even with a paper to present), and women should not expect equal
treatments as their male counterparts. These are the few examples of the
unwritten, but unshakable rules all employees have to observe.

	All junior researchers, up to the supervisor level, belong to a labor
union. In essence, interestingly enough, it seems to be merely a cosmetic
device: a pacifying organization to please the union members. It is not 
functioning as labor unions are supposed to elsewhere. Every now and then,
the union will put up a show --- jointly with the management --- for instance,
to threaten a strike. It is usually the case too that the union and the
management reach an agreement right before the deadline. Other functions
of the labor union, expectedly, include organizing recreative activities for
union members.

	It may not be my cup of tea, but this management scheme works well in
Japan. Considering the cultural and psychological differences between
Americans and Japanese, caution should be exercised if similar methodologies
are to be introduced to America.

C. Salary/Promotion Scheme
   ----------------------
	Promotion in NEC is based on seniority and educational background.
Loyalty is honored and respected, and experience and know-how are retained.
In time, some are promoted to be managers, while others are promoted to
senior research positions to serve as consultants for the younger researchers.

	The other side of the coin, however, may not be as shiny. The world
of high-tech changes everyday. When the more senior members of the research
staff cannot cope with this, they suppress the younger minds from changing
as well. This pose yet another inertial problem. In a society where
seniority means authority, and authority is usually unquestionable, logic
and reasoning may have to give way.

	To probe further, it is helpful to examine the distribution of labor
union members in NEC. The bar chart showing the distribution of male members
as a function of age peaks at the age groups of 24 and 35 respectively; and a 
valley dips at the age group of 31. It also shows that the membership declines 
exponentially beyond the age group of 35. The dip in the distribution for
those at the age around 30 reflects the impact of the oil crisis in the 1970's,
whence NEC apparently had a hire freeze. The declining membership for men
over 35 can be explained, as mentioned earlier, that once the employee becomes
a manager, which occurs when he turns 35, he will no longer belong to the
labor union.

	On the female side, there seems to be a cutoff in membership for
female who are 28 or over. They are not promoted --- they are married, and
subsequently retired from the work force. The sharp decline in membership
for those who are 24 or older thus merely indicates the rate of their getting
married. A Japanese joke has it that women in that age range are like 
Christmas cakes: on 24th Christmas Eve, everybody wants them; on 25th Christmas
Day, still marginal; but on 26 the after Christmas, those strawberry 
shortcakes will have to be wasted.

	As for basic salary, at the first glance, Japanese engineers seem to
be far underpaid compared with their American counterparts. The following
chart shows the average monthly salary of employees at various ages, who
are male and college graduates, of some of the largest electronics companies
in Japan.

---------------------------
Companies / Salary (in Yen)
---------------------------
		Age:	25		30		35
	Yrs.of Exp.:	 3		 8		13
	#of depend.:	 0		 2		 3
----------------------------------------------------------------
NEC			164,020		233,010		292,220
Hitachi			166,500		241,200		N.A.
Matsushita		164,500		232,500		301,500
Toshiba			158,641		248,295		288,224
Fujita			159,550		228,090		288,340
Mitibishi		162,916		252,632		320,339
Sanyo			163,800		215,300		274,800

	The chart above is obtained in the labor union member handbook
issued to NEC employees in the year 1986.

	At the age of 25 with a college degree and three years of experience,
a typical male employee of NEC (regardless of areas, may it be clerical or
technical), for example, makes a meager Y164,020 per month, which is barely
over $1,000 even with the recent skyrocketing exchange rate of the Japanese
Yen. His other incomes, however, include an annual bonus equivalent to six
months of his salary. If he is aggressive enough, he can work overtime, which
most people do in NEC, and makes an addition of up to 70% of his basic salary.
Tax rate is 17% for him. Transportation is paid for by the company. He could
also be living in a dormitory (possibly with meal plans) heavily subsidized by 
the company. His income, after tax, would be close to $20K per year. For an
American 25 years old engineer, due to the heavy income tax, he/she will have
to gross well in excess of $30K in order to match this net.  Furthermore, 
the standard wage increase is 5.5% each year. Accounting for the different 
inflation rates, an American engineer will need more than a 10% annual 
increase to match this.

	Such employment and salary data are possible only in Japan, where
everyone works for the same company for life. In America, such would be
impossible, as hopping from job to job seems to be THE way to climb ---
both on the managerial and the wage ladder. A direct comparison, therefore,
would be unfair.

D. Miscellaneous
   -------------
	Racial segregation and sexual discrimination in NEC is unacceptable
from a gaijin's point of view. Gaijins and women should not expect promotion
like native male Japanese do, for instance. Women get lower pay for the same
job, while gaijins may receive a higher pay to compensate for the smaller
annual bonus. On the hierarchy of discrimination, Westerners are to be adored,
while Asians are to be slighted. My case (being an Asian-American) left my
colleagues rather perplexed.

	In the daytime, it is my impression that no one works seriously. As
opposed to the workaholic image generally perceived by Americans, groups
of people are found chatting with each other in the office most of the time.
Although Japanese engineers work long hours, the actual amount of work done
is questionable. Overtime work serves only as a mean to earn extra income, as
opposed to the need of extra time for finishing the job.

	Drinking after work is seldom. After staying in the company with the
same people for 12-13 hours everyday, there is not much left to say. 
Furthermore, a recent survey reveals that for most married salarymen, their
monthly allowance is less than Y20,000 (~$130). Considering the custom that
superiors should pay for the junior colleagues, there is not much mileage to
this skimpy allowance. As for the singles, in order to save enough money
for the traditional wedding ceremony, which costs roughly Y6 million ($40K),
they cannot quite afford it either. Daily life of a Japanese may not be as
glamorous, and the noisy pachinko parlors --- a form of pinball machine
parlours --- become one of their most favorite havens to escape to.

	Japanese workers are not unbreakable. Samurai all of them it may seem,
once in a while, they, too, break down like everybody else. In the West, those
who break down go nuts. In Japan, they commit suicide. Not an exception, it
happens to employees in NEC too, although such cases are indeed the best kept
secret of the company. The most broadcasted recent case of such a nature
would be the suicide of the JAL clerk who was in charge of handling insurance
matters pertaining to the crash that killed over 500 people May, 1985. The
work load was enormous, and the crash indirectly crushed him too.

	Other minutes are too numerous to recount here. With the closer link
between Japan and America, Japan is more accessible than ever. In an effort
to understand more about America, every night, reporters of NHK (one of the
most popular TV stations in Japan) stationed both in New York and Washington,
D.C. tell their stories about America. Perhaps it is not a bad idea for the
Americans to follow suit to put extra efforts into trying to understand each
other.


III. Conclusion
     ----------
	The ways of life in Japan is definitely different from that of America.
It is different, but not better or worse. One should always keep an open mind,
and to understand is far better than blind teasing or admiration. The cultural
difference is wide, and each is unique. That is why Japan is Japan, and
America is always America.

	Amidst the zooming cans of human sardine known as subways and the
serenity of the Shinto shrines, similarities in daily life between Americans
and Japanese are striking too. They work hard, and the play hard. They are
proud of their country and their achievements like we are. After all, Japanese
is one of the biggest consumers of American goods, and they are one of our
most important allies. Instead of working against each other, we should work
together. A better mutual understanding is the only key to resolve any conflict
we may have.

	It has not been my intention, nor am I qualified, to characterize and
to describe Japanese as a people. In their eyes, American ways of life are
equally fascinating, if not more so. For a comprehensive and a critical look
at Japan, the best way would be to experience it personally. When this is not
feasible, the recent boom of literature in this area can be helpful as well.

	This report, as mentioned before, is only a personal statement. The
world changes everyday. So does Japan and so do I. My view of Japan is bound
to change. So stay tune, everybody.
