My performance ability not allowing me to play any instrument more
expressive than tympani, I rely on the musical interpretations of
others.  Some people point out how Glenn Gould's style makes each part
in, say, the Goldberg Variations, distinct.  As with all great
musicians, his personality influences his style.  His humming
distracts me.

When music is played by someone who isn't a professional, the individual
influence takes place on a different level: emotions influence the
performance.  People who reached long ago at age twelve that level of
technical skill which they never surpass invariably do certain things
when facing a piano after a long absence.  They turn pages, look, and
stop on those same pieces that everyone remembers, not quite the ``best
loved hits'' of LP-or-cassette TV ads, but music that has become
representative of the composer.  There must be devoted to Bach's
two-part inventions at least the full 57 seconds, though likely more
through repetitions and revisions, to \#8 in F.

But these words are too harsh, like the New Yorker cartoon a few
Christmases ago showing prisoners chained to a wall: ``And now,
Pachabel's Canon.''  I like hearing these pieces, these people playing
them.  Mostly it is women who take the risk and play.  Men who stopped
taking piano at the onset of adolescence have too much bound up in the
idea to play without purposefully putting in mistakes, as if it were a
joke.

A certain Mozart piano sonata, known but not by number, will float
half-remembered for days afterwards.  If I wonder about the name, ask
someone, ``hum a few bars,'' I feel silly when they ask me back: ``Yes,
but why would you want to know the name?''  The tone of voice, the
expression, they remind me of answers about the English names of South
American or Asian plants: What would it tell you?

Still, pieces with names are better.  I can remember them, so I needn't
ask, exposing the ideas to air and light.  Beethoven's ``F\"uer Elise'' is
in the this repertoire.  There are certain women who can play F\"uer Elise
in a way that brings out a kind of poignancy that musicians never find in
it.

Last night I paused, stayed at the entrance to a piano room too small for
the Steinway it contained, but large enough to conspire with the piano to
make Susan look small, small-on-drugs small, as she looked through the
sheet music scattered on top of the piano.  I didn't need to hold any
breath, or even to wait.  I knew, with a giddy certainty, what she was
going to play.

I remembered a night with strawberry daiquiris, in a trailer in the
woods in Mississippi.  I dropped in after leaving a party with Keith
and Emily, who were ostensibly dating other people; my presence helped
their plot, and besides, Keith and I were friends.

Emily I had known for years.  I once sent her a quote from Goethe; he
wanted someone to walk with him in his garden.  That I have neither before
nor since read Goethe makes it easier for me to understand how she must
have felt.  I hear they discussed it in her English class.  But I knew her
from before.  There exists, somewhere in Mississippi but not in the woods,
a photograph of twelve tiny people, sitting straight in their chairs,
Emily two down from me.  I imagine Emily also exists in Mississippi.  On
that night, though, I had no need to imagine.

The trailer belonged to Scott, Darlene's flight-instructor friend.
Darlene was always at a distance, not dating or following the right
people.  Keith and Emily were content, though, to drop in for a drink or
two, as if it were a casual thing.

During two daiquiris, including the strawberries which had been at the
bottom soaking up alcohol, my conversation with Scott drifted to
music.  We differed when he put on a record of a certain rockish trio
arrangement of a Russian composition whose name escapes me.

Emily, who had been sitting legs tucked under and to the side, stood and
walked, gently drunk, to the piano.  She did not look for music, and when
she glanced down at the keyboard and raised her hands slightly, I took in
breath with her.

As she played, I became unaware of Scott, of Darlene.  When she
reached the ninth note, she slipped, started again.  It was not the
repetition that caught me, but her own concentration on the music.
She didn't give up or apologize.  Only at the very first did she start
over.  False notes she corrected immediately, occasionally playing a
phrase again; I understood only that she was human, a woman.  I became
entranced with her and her music, the mistakes making it hers.  Even
Keith wasn't there and I felt I followed her down certain streets, the
turns gentle, unhurried, but necessarily unsure.

Later, the liquor all gone, we piled into a sedan.  Emily and I were in
the back seat.  She closed her eyes for a moment and leaned progressively
in my direction.  When I found her head on my shoulder, I spoke to her,
touching her briefly, tentatively.  When she assured me she was not
asleep, I put my arm around her, and we rode on away from the trailer, past
long-leaf yellow pines you couldn't see in the dark.

I didn't even hear Susan start to play the Steinway, but I knew the sound
was not the reproduced sound of my memory.  Overtones, presence, timbre:
the words dance around the feeling but never approach it, never tame
enough to reach out and take it.  Not wanting to interfere, I walked away
for a moment, talked to my friends, still hearing the piano in the
background.  When she played the Sonata in C Major, I was flushed with the
evening heat, and went to the open window near the piano room.  Susan,
now, was involved in her music, and wouldn't care if I listened.

When she reached F\"uer Elise, I felt like some watcher of the skies when
an old, familiar planet returns.  The ninth note, wrong in just the right
way.
