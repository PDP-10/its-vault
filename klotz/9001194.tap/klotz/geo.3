\noindent Dear Setsuko-san and Kurita-san,

Thank you for your wonderful letter in January.  I'm very sorry to take so
long in answering it, but school has been difficult for me and I wanted to
take some time in writing you back.  Spring really seems to have arrived,
though it's still cold here.  Last week it rained a lot, but today the
weather was beautiful, if a little chilly.

I'm a full-time student this term, taking an electrical engineering course
in Fourier and other transforms, a laboratory in Psychoacoustics, and a
poetry course.  The EE course is pretty hard, so I'm taking only three
courses.

At the end of May I'm going to go to Mississippi for a few days to visit
my father, and from there I'll go to Berkeley to work with Andy diSessa on
Boxer for June and most of July.

It was fun being in Berkeley in January, although I didn't get as much
work done as I'd like to.  Andy was on vacation in Mexico for the first
week I was there, so I didn't get to see him much.

The stories you told about Seymour are pretty typical.  A friend of mine
who is a student at AMT lives upstairs, and she's just now finishing her
master's thesis for Seymour.  She's going to the Ph.D. program in
Developmental Psychology at Harvard when she graduates.  Seymour hadn't
read through her thesis and he's going to Bulgaria(!) for a month soon.  I
heard from her that he finally signed her thesis today.

Mitch Resnick, a graduate student in Hal Abelson's Educational Computing
Group, is writing a thesis on a multi-processing version of Logo with
special consideration on the Lego/Logo interface.  You probably know Mitch
from Microworlds.  Anyway, if you talk to Mitch, you should ask him to
send you a copy of his thesis when it's done.

Coral Software has released their Object Logo programming language.  It
looks pretty complete.  It's probably a little complicated for beginners,
but it's certainly an impressive package.  I haven't seen it running in a
while, but I've seen the manual.  I use the object-oriented programming
style sometimes, but I don't believe it's suited for everything.  It seems
to be pretty good for turtle graphics and other kinds of graphics, though.

Terrapin has been selling the Logo that Patrick and I wrote for quite a
while now.  They haven't finished the documentation, and they have found
some bugs which they want me to fix, but by and large they have been
selling it since September.  I don't think too many people want Logo for
the Macintosh.  I think Coral's language has a better chance than our Logo
or LCSI's Logo (which Microsoft dropped!) because it represents something
new and will appeal to a different set of people than Logo does.

By the way, I got accepted to Prof. Hironaka's seminar, and so I'll be in
Japan beginning July 25.  The seminar is at Lake Tazawa, in Akita
prefecture.  I hear it's very pretty there, and not such a bad place to be
in late July and August.  There's a chance I may participate in his
seminar for Japanese hich-school students, also.

I'm not sure what I'll be doing after that, but I'm planning to be in
Japan for all of August.  I have some friends in Tokyo I want to visit,
and I'd also like to go see Nobuyuki Ueda's LMT in Nara (I hear it's a
museum now).

In any case, I'd like to visit with you folks for a while and see your
operation there.  If there's anything I could do for you, it would be
great.  I was very suprised and pleased when you asked me if I wanted to
work for you for a year.  I still have about one and a half years of
school left, (It sounds like less when I say "three semesters!") so it's
hard for me to plan that far in advance.  

I'm not sure what sorts of things I could do for a whole year that would
be helpful for you.  One thing that I could do is teach things about Logo
or Lisp or Scheme -- either programming in them or implementing them.
Does Geodesic implement software these days?  If so, I could teach these
techniques to your developers.  If not, maybe you could offer some sort of
seminars in programming.

I don't really know much about implementing languages other than Logo,
Lisp, and Boxer.  Certainly implementing one of those languages is more
than a year's project, and I don't know whether you'd be interested in
competing with (for example) LCSI.

Another idea would be to help on a writing project.  I certainly couldn't
write a book in Japanese on Logo programming, but I could help you work on
an advanced Logo programming book if you think that sort of thing would be
useful.  If it looks like a good idea, maybe some work with
object-oriented programming in Logo would be a good start.  

I also know a fair amount about Macintosh programming, so I could help
with any projects people are doing on that computer.  It also goes without
saying, of course, that I could help with anything you need done with
English -- if you start writing a book in English, for example!

Altogether, though, I'm not sure that my working for a whole year would
really help you.  I don't think I have any ideas for a big project that
would take that long.  I'd be happy to work on one or two shorter
projects, either of the kind above or other things, for a couple of
months.  Also, since it would be excellent experience and lots of fun, if
it's not a whole year then the money issues are much less important, for
you and for me.

If you have time when I'm in Japan, I'd like to stay at least a day or two
and we can talk about possible projects then, and how long they might
take.  I'm interested in working with the two of you, and I want to do
something that would be fun and would be good for Geodesic.

I'm glad to hear that you're translating Mac Revealed.  I used those books
towards the end of working on Logo.

Thank you very much for writing me such a long letter, and for spending so
much time writing it carefully for so it would be very easy to read.  It's
the only letter I've ever gotten in Japanese that was more than a page
long!

Please let me know how things are going there.  I'm looking forward to
seeing you.
