In "Visitors with Too Much Baggage," Marge Piercy describes a meeting
between a man and a woman, former lovers, but each now with a different
husband and wife.  Through a series of images and questions, the poem
explores the mental state of the woman, confronted with her former lover
in the presence of both of their spouses.

In the first stanza, the woman looks only at parts of the wife, unable to
put them together.  Her gaze following the man's arm to the wife, she
first mentions her teeth, then hair, then the curve of her neck.  The
teeth, however, are not actual teeth.  The wife merely "looks about to cry
teeth."  The phrase invokes the concept of teeth and introduces the word
without actually talking about the wife's teeth.  The image itself perhaps
brings up common nightmare of losing one's teeth, giving an unpleasant
dreamlike quality to the scene being described.  The starkness of the
teeth stands in contrast to the words used later in the stanza.

Even though the poem describes conversation and uses strongly active
verbs, the scene seems static or in slow motion.  The woman pressing
herself to her husband for support makes him seem rooted in the ground;
the wife is similarly weighted down by her the man's arm.

The woman puts her husband in an unfavorable light even as she is leaning
on him for support.  In reaction to having to lie and pretend that there
is nothing wrong or awkward, he grinds his teeth, though on a more
primitive level he is perhaps gnashing his teeth at an intruder, a former
lover of his wife.  If only by the repetition, teeth begin to acquire an
importance.  He is talking fast and not saying anything, like a car
salesman.

When she mentions the man talking, she treats it not as speech, but as a
blunt weapon hitting her.  On this image contributes the slowed-down
feeling of the poem becomes more pronounced and surrealistic.  The voice
is so low that the vibrations are sensed individually, as a beating, and
stands in contrast to her husband's speech.

Until this point the poem has been realistic and in the present.  Piercy
has used some metaphorical language, but on the whole has kept to
descriptions and fairly simple emotional judgements.  The reader has a
fairly good idea of what the speaker in the poem thinks about the four
characters.  The lover's wife is the most distant, but the best physically
described.  The woman sees her own husband as talking, but not saying
anything of substance, like a car salesman.  His words are unimportant,
and he deals with surface matters.  When the lover speaks, his words too
are unimportant, but for quite the opposite reason: the mere sound of his
voice is so important to her that she cannot apprehend it cognitively, and
cannot form words out of the sounds.

At this point the woman becomes introspective.  The man has spoken to her,
and she cannot reply because she has not heard or understood what he said.
She realizes that even if she had understood, they would have nothing to
say to each other.  At this point, the word "exchange" has no particular
meaning, but later by contrast with an actual use of "say" and a
refinement of exchange, it becomes clear that the word refers to the kind
of relationship they had before, and which they can no longer have.

In the third stanza, the woman begins to fantasize about how she could get
from her present situation into one where she could be alone with her
former lover.  She moves to some other-worldly-place, "a cave behind the
... neutral bathroom mirror."  The word "neutral" is key.  The current
meeting ground is her husband's house, where they cannot communicate
freely.  The fantasy quickly turns sour, with "bloodshot sky."  Neutrality
is apparently not enough.  She wonders, "What can we say?"

John Berryman, in {\em The Dream Songs}, #4, describes a situation similar
but not in every respect, and from a man's point of view.  In the Berryman
poem, a man (Henry) finds himself attracted to a married woman, but in the
presence of her husband he can hardly say anything to her.  The setting of
the poem is a dinner, so the awkwardness of conversation at a meeting is
avoided.  Henry's reaction to his desire is to begin fantasizing about
being alone with the woman.  He imagines what he would say to her, and
despairs when he realizes that he cannot get to her: She is on Mars.  He
quite forthrightly calls her husband a slob.  He wonders, "Where did it
all go wrong?"

The fantasies in the two poems diverge.  Of course, there is no wife
present to complicate Henry's life, and Henry has apparently not met the
woman of his desires before.  However, Henry does have a second person who
works along with his conscience and makes him feel guilty about
contemplating adultery.  The woman in Piercy's poem does does try
considering what would happen if she and the man were meeting for the
first time, with her current marriage being irrelevant.  She says "If we
could begin brandnew with courtesies and guesses," but stops short of
saying what would be possible if they could begin again, ending the poem
without ending the sentence, and instead contemplating death.  The
condition in the "if..." even parodies itself, using the consumerist
phrase "brand new" made into a word.

Although the most obvious reason for the differences in the two poems is
that the man and the woman in Piercy's poem have already been involved,
separated, and married to other people, the gender difference is also
important.  The woman in Piercy's poem backs away from her former lover
even as he advances.  He speaks to her, but she does not respond.  Given
the title of the poem and the way she talks about the meeting, it seems
unlikely that she invited him freely.  The only thing she wants to do is
to explain to her former lover why they can no longer exchange anything.

The fourth stanza is quite cryptic, but is teeming with desperation, and
ends with death.  Everything in the stanza is dry and white: winter,
teeth, scars, headstones, bones; even the night is white.  In this stanza
the speaker offers one explanation of what she means by "exchange."  What
they did when they were lovers was to trade things.  The things they
traded are most likely stories, feelings, and ways of understanding one
another, but the language is bleak and empty.  

Teeth again appear.  The woman has need for the man clamped in her teeth,
whereas the man's wife is crying and losing her teeth.  The combination of
these two images admits itself of many interpretations.  It could show
differences between the women, in that one holds on to the man with her
teeth while the other keeps the man even in the appearance of losing
teeth.  It could simultaneously show that the women both hold on to the
man with teeth.  In any case, the teeth contribute to the feeling of
desperation in both keeping and losing the lover.

At first it seems that "till the night bled white and the sun rose" refers
to one night spent together in this kind of exchange.  The "ice rumpked
lake" brings the reader back to "All one winter", though, and the final
line of the stanza shows that the rising sun ended their relationship,
just as it ended the nights of exchange, the winter, and killed the
sparrows.  The clutching of the sparrows mirror the clamped teeth.

The fourth stanza describes a relationship no one would want to continue.
It is not possible to tell from the poem, though, whether this vision is
accurate, or whether it has lost its color and hardened over the years.

The last stanza returns to the present.  The woman projects her feelings
onto her lover, after having gone back to their past.  She sees them both
having grown in different directions, and says that they are "rival
clocks."  Everything they have exchanged in the past has become invalid.

The second line, "Shall we exchange little fingers, or spit?" is
ambiguous.  Exchanging little fingers would normally mean some sort of
kindergarten handshake, but in a poem with words like "bone flutes," it is
quite possible the speaker is talking about actually removing fingers, a
distasteful proposition at best.  It is unclear wither "spit" is a noun or
a verb: is spit to be exchanged, or are they to spit at each other or the
ground?  In other words, even if they kissed, it would not be a kiss, but
an exchange of spit, and hardly different from spitting on the ground in
dislike or suspicion.  If all the things they have for exchange now are so
unpleasant, perhaps it is better not to exchange anything.

Yet, in the last line we see that the speaker is interested in her old
lover; she holds a morbid curiosity about him.  The phrase "live and
curious noses" conjures images of mice or rats or other animals with
twitching noses.  The wreaths in the poem are false because both people
are alive, but they are wreaths because the person that each once was is
no longer.

{\em Dream Songs #4} ends with Henry wanting to outlaw himself and being
told that he already is.  The law referred to is most likely the one
prohibiting adultery, but the fact that Henry sees outlawing himself as
the only way out of his predicament over the woman brings out his
desperation more strongly.  The Henry character is an unhappy,
self-critical person.  The vagueness of his connection with the woman he
desires shows that he can find himself in such a situation with relative
ease: it hardly has to do with her.  The woman in {\em Visitors with
Too Much Baggage}, though, is in a position unusual and painful for
anyone.  She is made unhappy with her husband, but she remains married and
is realistic in her estimation of a future with the former lover.
