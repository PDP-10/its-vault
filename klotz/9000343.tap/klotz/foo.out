Message-ID: <860718215827.4.KLOTZ@JOE-LOUIS.LCS.MIT.EDU>

I changed the *strt-row-code* etc. variables back to the roman things
because I was getting screwed too much by the brackets.  You have to
recompile stream, bxfile, emanip, and pbox.  I'm going to do a
recompile, but I want to have a record of the patches.

JOE:>BOXER>PATCH>New-Boxer-7>New-Boxer-7-7.lisp
Function BOXER:CHA-LENGTH-OF-EVROW-ITEM:  Fix to this function to make BUILD [LABEL: @FOO] work.
Previously there was no recursive call to this function on the label-pair case so it was calling string-length on the 
unbox list.
DEFBOXER-FUNCTION BOXER:READ-MAIL:  Faster.
DEFBOXER-FUNCTION BOXER:READ-MAIL-FROM-FILE:  Faster/
Function BOXER:READ-MAIL-FROM-FILE-TO-BOXES:  Faster.
Function BOXER:READ-ONE-TWENEX-MESSAGE:  Faster.
Function BOXER:READ-ONE-ITS-MESSAGE:  Faster.
Function BOXER:SIMPLE-MAKE-TEXT-BOX:  New function for putting text into boxes.
Function BOXER:SIMPLE-MAKE-TEXT-ROW:  New function for making simple text rows.
Function (:PROPERTY BOXER:UNBOX-TOKEN BOXER:EVAL-HANDLER):  Attempt to fix unbox of ports in BUILD.
Doesn't quite work right because it doesn't produce a series of ports, which it should.
Function BOXER:CHAS-ARRAY-INSERT-STRING:  New function for supporting :INSERT-TEXT-STRING-AT-CHA-NO
message.
Function BOXER:CHAS-ARRAY-INSERT-LIST-OF-CHAS:  This function re-implements the :insert-list-of-chas message
for ROWs in a more efficient manner.
Function BOXER:CHAS-ARRAY-DELETE-CHA:  Uh, no change here.
Function (:METHOD BOXER:ROW :INSERT-CHA-AT-CHA-NO):  Ditto.
Function (:METHOD BOXER:ROW :INSERT-TEXT-STRING-AT-CHA-NO):  New message for inserting a text string into a row.
Obviously a string can't contain a box.  This is sort of the inverse of the :TEXT-STRING message.
Function (:METHOD BOXER:ROW :INSERT-LIST-OF-CHAS-AT-CHA-NO):  A re-implementation of this function.  It
uses the multiple character slide feature to avoid doing a zillion extend-arrays, one for each char.
Variable BOXER:*STRT-BOX-CODE*:  I went back to the old ROMAN-I to ROMAN-IV codes, since I see no conceivable reason
to use [] and {} when they keep screwing us left and right.  ROMAN-I, II, and III are circle, square, and triangle.
Variable BOXER:*STOP-BOX-CODE*:  Ditto.
Variable BOXER:*STRT-ROW-CODE*:  Ditto.
Variable BOXER:*STOP-ROW-CODE*:  Ditto.
Variable BOXER:*QUOTE-CODE*:  Ditto.
Variable BOXER:*BOXER-STREAM-SPECIAL-CHARACTERS*:  Ditto.
Function BOXER:INSERT-ENTRY-IN-ROW-AT-ENTRY-NO:  This used to call (make-row-with-padded-value t) 
and would introduce extraneous spaces in insertion operations.
Function BOXER:CHANGE-ENTRY-IN-ROW-AT-ENTRY-NO:  Ditto for make-row-with-padded-value.

Function BOXER:PROCESS-ROW-ELEMENT-FOR-BUILD:  Fix BUILD [!E] where E is

I'm not sure how this got broken or if it was a long time ago.  But
anyway, 
       --------
 BUILD | !FOO |
       --------

where FOO is a doit box did not evaluate FOO.  Instead it returned FOO
as a DOIT box inside the build.  If FOO is instead a primitive, it
evaluates the primitive.  I talked to Ed and he seemed to think
that it was broken, too.  So I fixed it.

Subject: TI

Thanks much for your reply on TI.  The only thing I am still
considering with TI is buying a machine for development.  What makes
this possible is that by end of first quarter next year, they are
promising the upgrade to 5 times processor speed (at least -- or so
they say).  I figure that's twice a 3600.  I don't know when Symbolics
is going to give us next generation, and I don't want to wait long
(the TI next spring wait would be too long, except that the upgrade is
a field upgrade and we can have a machine, so far as it goes,
instantly).

Most sites will only get one Sun.  A couple may get two.  That
excludes us, who should have about half dozen.  So a one disk/two suns
may in fact save us a few disk.

If I didn't tell you, latest on the Sun deal is that (1) the
university is giving us 4 or 5 (with disks).  And (2) I think I can get
the university to buy a site license for Lucid, if that doesn't cost
too much.  The Suns for us are on campus, so it's just a matter of
getting someone to deliver them.  That's not easy, but I figure it's
easier than negotiating a deal with Sun and waiting for delivery.
Besides, it keeps options open and frees me to think about other
things for a while.

David has been trying to track down our suns, so he hasn't started
serious hacking.  Also, if I didn't mention it, Ed and David went to
sun to see about their possible new window system.  Sounds like a win.
Plus I saw a picture of the new Suns.  They look about 5 inches tall,
and just big enough to fit under the display.  Really nice.

Subject: BBOARD

Probably this isn't the right list for this, but I'm not sure
what is.

I'm getting tired of seeing multiple copies of messages people
send to BBOARD@FOO, BBOARD@BAR, BBOARD@QUUX, etc, thinking those
are three different BBOARDs rather than forwarding to everywhere
else.  This wasn't such a problem when there were only a few
machines in the world and only one clique of people using them.
But now we have a zillion machines used by different communities
on a common network.

I propose that "BBOARD" be redefined on all the AI/LCS/AMT/...
machines to refer to just the local machine.  Then there could be
lists that explicitly indicate that they distribute to several
machines, like ARPANET-BBOARDS only more specific, like
MIT-BBOARDS, TECH-SQ-BBOARDS, AI-LAB-BBOARDS.

Ideally there would be a filter on the larger -BBOARDS the way
there is on ARPANET-BBOARDS, but this probably won't be critical
until the local network doubles again.

Hello.  I have spent a sad weekend.  I suppose that Patrick has told you
about this new woman person, Therese?  Of course I have no right, but
I'm completely distraught. 

Also, I moved this weekend.  I rented a van, packed it up, drove it SF.
Then it broke down.  That was at 2:30.  At 1:30 in the morning the
people finally came to pick me.  

Well, Patrick is in Hawaii and Saul is going away.  My shrink is also
away.  EVERYBODY's away.

How was your weekend?  Was is ok?  Did schoolteacher visit?

    Re:   BUILD lossage

    What I meant about build ignoring bindings was the following case.
    Suppose your build template (arg to build) has a variable named
    X bound in it, and you have !X in the template.  Currently the
    !X does not expand into the binding of X.  Presumably this could
    be fixed by dynamically doing the bindings in the template box.

I'm still a but confused.  Suppose we try the Lisp analogue:

(define x 37)

`(let ((x 10))
   (+ 1 ,x))

Here it's clear that we want (let ((x 10)) (+ 10 37))

Are you saying that 

x: 37

      ----------
BUILD |  x: 10 |
      |        |
      | !x + 1 |
      ----------

should behave differently?

I gather you have implemented (fixed) Boxer explode and implode.  I
suggest we call these LETTERS and WORDS.  What is the user level
representation for spaces and carriage returns when a box gets exploded??

Subject: build

I don't feel strongly about whether BUILD takes into account bindings
in boxes.  I suppose the "right" thing is to take them into account,
but what then happens if bindings are part of what's built? -- we have
to worry about order.  Anybody see any reason to care strongly one way
or the other??
