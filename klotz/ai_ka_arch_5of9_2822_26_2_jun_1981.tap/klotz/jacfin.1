USE TYPOLOGY  Tuesday, Nov. 4

This is an elaboration of the newly established use categories.

A schematic representation of the categories [New numbers (as of Nov. 4)
used here]:

|                  |                  |
---------------------------------------

The recently established language looks like this:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.The determination of [ ] inference |2. The determination of [ ] inference
or causality as a legal proposition, |or causality in a specific case, 
where scientific uncertainty is      |where scientific uncertainty is
associated with each causal          |associated with each causal 
mechanism.                           |mechanism.

                                     |
3.The determination of [ ] inference |4.The determination of [ ] inference

                                     |
                                     |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. The determination, as a legal     |6. The determination, in a specific
proposition, that the [ ] capability |case, that the [ ] capability does

                                     |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Matrix notation is a useful convention in the discussion of use categories.
The categories are divided into three vertical, and two horizontal sectors.
An analyst assigns each issue a category, based on the characteristics of
each bin.  Therefore, it is important to delineate the differences between
the right and left sectors, as well as the three vertical ones.


Vertical Division:

The categorizations are generated by the intersection of two parameters:
scope of effect (left-to-right) and the kind of science involved (up and
down). Since the characteristics of the Feasibility (bottom) level are well
established I will discuss the upper two levels first.

In the new use typology, the topmost level describes issues in which the
science is not only controverted, but uncertain.  These are issues about
which uncertainty exists in the scientific community.  The middle level
describes issues in which the science is controverted, but not uncertain.
(Recall that in order to have a scientific issue, science must
be controverted.) In top level, we see uncertainty in the science, while in
middle level, we see uncertainty in the circumstances or order of events.
In top level issues, the scientific community will be in disagreement about
the science, while in middle level issues, it will not.

As the leading edge of science or technology moves forward, an issue can
move from the top to the middle level.  As agreement in the scientific
community develops, and (less reliably) as standards are promulgated by
regulatory agencies, the science involved will become more "established;"
the uncertainty reduced.  

An example of this migration is a hypothetical case of a former shipyard
worker who has lung cancer, and who claims a particular historical
level of exposure to asbestos.  Let us assume that he is a nonsmoker.  It
is conceivable that if he had brought suit 10 years ago, the dose-response
relationship would have been so tenuous as to preclude judgment in his
favor. But if he brings action today, and claims historical
exposure in excess of current standards (or levels currently considered
safe), his probability of success is much higher.  The issue here might be
whether the historical level of exposure claimed by the plaintiff did in
fact exist. The scientific issue would have migrated from top level to
middle level.  In doing so, the issue takes on characteristics of a more
general proposition, without moving left in the matrix.

If the worker is a smoker, and evidence is introduced which tends to
implicate smoking, not asbestos exposure, as the cause of his illness, the
issue becomes a category 2 issue (top level), because uncertainty currently
exists in the scientific community regarding the synergism of smoking and
particulate exposure.

The feasibility level may be thought of as a subset of the two upper
levels, because in every feasibility issue, a question of scientific
causality or inference is present.  The subset warrants warrant a separate
level.

The vertical division described above is necessary in order to isolate the
function of science in the judicial decision-maker's reasoning process. The
distinctions are tractable, and will delineate the effects of different
kinds of science on the decision process, in terms of engagement, standard
of review, and other parameters.


Horizontal Division:

The left-to-right division in the new scheme arbitrarily creates two levels
of scope-of-effect. In this, the design is like the
legislative/adjudicative division. Here lies the most significant
difference between the new typology and the McGovern typology. Note that
McGovern's categories 1,2, and 3 denote a scheme in which there are three
horizontal divisions, rather than two. That is, instead of merely "legal
proposition" and "specific case" McGovern's scheme has three columns
described by the phrases "legal proposition", "application of a legal
proposition to a specific entity," and "application of a general legal
proposition concerning specific subject matter to a specific set of facts."
These distinctions in "levels of generality" are not completely clear.  

McGovern's divisions are not based on the kind of science involved, but
rather on finer gradations of the legislative /adjudicative scheme. In
matrix form [McGovern numbers used here]:

Legal Prop............................Specific Case
---------------------------------------------------
| 1.    |            2.           |         3.    |Causality
|       |                         |               |
---------------------------------------------------
|       4. ?                  ?            5.     |Feasibility
|          ?                  ?                   |
---------------------------------------------------

(McGovern's memo does not deal with the Feasibility level; this creates
uncertainty as to the horizontal placement of 4 and 5 on the matrix. In
fact, we should ask whether, in the McGovern scheme, a basis exists for the
postulation of an additional category on the Feasibility level.)

The McGovern memo provides examples illustrating his categories 1, 2, and
3. One set of examples: "An administrative agency might decide that the
findings of epidemiological studies are sufficiently certain that the use of
epidemiology rises to the level of a legal proposition. [Category 1] An
example of category 2 would be the use of an epidemiological study to
establish that substance 'a' is a carcinogen.  An example of category
3...would be that Joe Jones's cancer was caused by substance 'a'."

This system discriminates between issues of Categories 1, 2, and 3 by
"level of generality."  A determination of category does not turn on the
kind of science involved.  The first example above would be in Category 1
in our new scheme, just as in McGovern's. The second issue might be
Category 1, not 2, in the new design. (Here lies a problem. This issue
could be issue less "general" than the first because it refers to a
specific STUDY, or because it refers to a specific SUBSTANCE. Which
alternative is implied is unclear.) The third issue above would lie in our
new category 2.

The McGovern scheme would allow the analyst greater precision in the
description of scope-of-effect, while seriously limiting the flexibility of the
important kind-of-science parameter. In actual practice, the more precisely
defined scope spectrum may be intractable; the analyst faced with options
of excessively narrow cross section.

For the analyst, the problem of specific case/legal proposition remains.  One
logical test would consider the court's intended scope of effect.  Other
criteria in choosing right or left might be the number of locations
involved, or the parties involved. (For example, if the plaintiffs
represent an entire industry, the use categorization would probably lie on
the left side of the matrix.)

The left side of the new matrix has been characterized as containing
preventative issues; the right side, compensatory. On the left side,
while circumstances or events might be historical, the impact of a
ruling would not be.

Generally, the right side of the matrix would contain plaintiff and
defendant cases; the left side, administrative ones.



Categorical Discussion:


Category 1--An example: does saccharin, a substance found to cause cancer
in laboratory animals, cause human cancers? OSHA, FDA, and EPA cases might
be categorized here.

In SOCIETY OF THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY v OSHA (509 F2nd 1041 (1975)
MITDB#120), petitioners claim that no proof exists in the record to justify
a 1 ppm exposure level for VCM, since testimony indicated that a threshold
level has not been established.


Category 2--Example: Was Mr. Smith's cancer caused by saccharin?  Some
product liability cases, such as toxic substance actions, and some
workmen's compensation cases would fall into this category. Some frontier
of science cases would also be included. Specific accident cases might be
found here.

In MAD v TRAINOR (DB#138), action was brought for injunction against the
opening of bids for construction on a highway.  Petitioners contest the
reliability of the traffic projections used.  The concept of "generated"
traffic is used.  The Court concludes that, given the general disagreement
of experts concerning "generated" traffic concepts, the uncertainty
involved in producing models of this type, the agency determinations must
be upheld.

Category 3--Issues of design defect might be here. Example: Should chain
saws of this particular design, from all manufacturers, be banned from sale?
OSHA cases would be contained here.

Category 4--Example: Was Mr. Smith's auto accident caused by brake failure?
This category comprises specific accident issues.

In CITY OF NORTH MIAMIvTRAIN (DB#131), the city brought action against EPA
to prevent the EPA from approving application by county for funds to
construct water treatment facilites. One issue--Do discharges from septic
tanks, package treatment plants and ocean outfalls presently threaten the
health and welfare of citizen of Dade County?  The plaintiffs filed
affidavits contesting the opinion of EPA's experts that discharges
threatened the health of citizens of Dade County.  Court finds that the
City is merely attempting to raise issues of fact in an attempt to defeat
summary judgment. This issue illustrates the difference between categories
2 and 4.  The science is not uncertain here; unsafe levels of various
pollutants are well established.  The question here is one of circumstance.
(The City raises this issue as a cover.)

Category 5--Example: Is the 1983 FWPCA provision for pH effluent from paper
plants technologically feasible? BAPT and NSPS cases here.

In AMERICAN MEAT INSTITUTE v EPA (DB#134) , organizations of slaughter- and
packinghouses petition for review of EPA-promulgated regulations.  One
issue--Will the magnitute of the effect of winter temperatures on anaerobic
lagoon effectiveness render compliance impossible? 

Category 6--Example: Will it be economically feasible for Mr. Smith's plant
to meet the requirements for thermal effluent?

In U.S.STEEL v. TRAIN (MITDB#125), US Steel seeks review of an EPA order
granting a NPDES permit for the company's Gary works.  One scientific issue
is whether limitations contained in Steel's permit are possible to achieve
with present technology.
