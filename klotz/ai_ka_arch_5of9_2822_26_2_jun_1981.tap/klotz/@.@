how would one or both of you like to give an interview to some people
from Classroom Computer News on AI, Robotics, etc. for kids?  They would
like to come on Monday, June 8.  If this is OK with you, could you call

Jeff Nilson
1-432-3411

before next Tuesday?  Let me know, in either case, what you want to do, and
if you get hold of him.

I talked with Seymour.  He seems to be a bit more flexible
than you might have thought and his reasons are not bad either.
His main concern is that there are new things that are done by
the end of the summer.  For the purposes of the Interest Worlds
project, ATARI Logo is not useful although it might have been
useful under different circumstances.

The speech stuff he thinks is good.  He hopes that, when you
are finished with it, that a kid could use Logo to make speech
sounds by doing a phoneme-analysis of the speech sounds he intends
to make.

The reason he gives for the rhythm stuff may give you some other
idea for doing it.  Mainly, he wants to make it possible for a kid
to be able to do something physical to produce or work with sound.
He thought the rhythm stuff would be good for that.  Maybe something
else would be better.  Maybe what you thought he had in mind was
bigger than this.  Again, the important thing is that something
works by the time your work is finished for the summer.

The summer workshop is planned for Spring-summer 82.  The reason he
wants new things is that he would like to see new effects when the
kids use the stuff.  The reason why things are so scaled down is obvious:
We talked about how much other activity he is engaged with, etc.

Anyhow, if none of the above clarifies the problem, you can help by
clarifying what you would be interested in doing.  Of course,
the catch is that there is limited time, it must get done when
you finish working here this summer and must be in the spirit
of the Interest worlds project.

Some humble new directions with software has a less humble effect
on the kids using it.  For practical reasons we are scaling down, but
I don't think Seymour thinks of this as basket weaving at all.

I'm going to write a routine that we people can assemble and
deposit in to allow them to make "self starting" files and
do some basic file i/o.

All I have to do is provide a routine for the OTPDEV which
pokes the characters into the edit buffer and another one
which saves the edit buffer on disk.

I'll use ENDBUF as the character pointer, so the end address
will be updated right.

BUFFERIO PO ALL PRINT [FOO] TVIO SAVE "BAR

wil create a file which runs the procedure FOO when loaded.

Leigh.
