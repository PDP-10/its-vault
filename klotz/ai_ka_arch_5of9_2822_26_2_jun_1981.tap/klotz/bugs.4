I am, of course, an excellent speller, easily dominating your people's
primitive language. On occasion, however, the generosity of my person
does not fully take into account the perversity of thought that
characterizes your ancestral tongue; in particular, I often expect
consistency where only chaos reigns.

Today I experienced some small doubts as to the correctness of my
spelling of the word "developed" (my better instincts fighting my
generosity of spirit), and carelessly loaded up your insignificant
spell package.  After allowing it to make the substitution, I noticed
that my cursor was left at the beginning of the line in which the word
occurred.

I await your apology and explanations.

An unfortunate characteristic of the English language, namely its
apparent simplicity, has made it impossible for me to abstract any
meaning from your missive. You feel that you have made clear what
you think in the words you have written. This is precisely the problem
which foreigners have with English: Your words are mere gibberish, yet
you feel that they carry great Meaning.

Weep not, for it is not your fault; all foreigners experienced only in
weak, unexpressive languages suffer from the same difficulties which
have stymied you in your efforts to communicate your ravings.

That you were able by small grunts and hand motion to show me just
what you meant indicates that you are not generally incapable of
expression; there is hope for those who must "unlearn" the former,
constraining modes of thinking induced by early exposure to deficient
languages.

Once I understood what you meant, I was able to get about the task at
hand. Not trusting Emacs, I used the purer Teco. (That both are pure
is beside the point.) Mark my words, I thought, Teco will show me the
answer.

Indeed it did. If you type the following string into a Teco, you, too
will be enlightened. Emacs won't do, as it displays certain characters
in unusual ways.

iHere we go quietly
Nuts in may.
1:l    !* Go to the end of the line.!
.u1    !* Save the point so we can restore it later.!
-fwl   !* Go the the beginning of the last word in the line.!
d      !* Imitate the action of the spell library. It sometimes makes words shorter.!
q1j

Displaying the point at this location is where Teco does one thing and
Emacs another. I guess the reason it never shows up in normal Emacs
usage is that it is impossible to get to such a place with the normal
commands:  and such don't do it.

If you really want to be grossed out, type into Emacs
î
and then type .

I guess the only way to fix this misfeature is for spell to check
the character at the point when it restores it, and go back one if it
is a î.

Yuk,
Leigh.

Re:   your message of earlier today

Starting up a Teco, I thought, mark my point.
Mark my point and my region will be empty.
