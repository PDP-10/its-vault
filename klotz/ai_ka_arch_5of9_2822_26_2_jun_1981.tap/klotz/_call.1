You can interface your own machine-language routines to Logo using the
.CALL primitive.  .CALL takes two inputs: the first is the address of
the routine, and the second an integer argument which the routine may
examine.  The routine may output an integer, or output nothing.

During the execution of the user routine, the Apple monitor ROM is
enabled, and the Apple Language Card memory containing a portion of
nodespace, the primitive names, and text for various Logo messages is
disabled.
