This documents the RS232 output routines in modified MIT Apple Logo version 2.

The primitive LPRINT is just like PRINT, but prints to the RS232 device.
LPRINT1 is like PRINT1, but prints to the RS232 driver.

Most devices won't do anything with what you give them unless it
ends with a carriage return. If you want to print a lot of things
with PRINT1 so that there aren't any carriage returns in it, you
still have to terminate the whole sequence with a carriage return;
i.e., PRINT [].

Use the following Logo procedure to initialize the Bare 800 printer.

TO PSETUP SLOT
MAKE "RSDATA (12*4096+10*16*14)+16*:SLOT
;Reset. Auto LF with CR.
PATCHC [74 55]
ERNAME RSDATA
ERASE PATCH
ERASE PSETUP
END

TO PATCHC STUFF
IF :STUFF=[] STOP
.DEPOSIT :RSDATA 27	;27 means "command character follows."
.DEPOSIT :RSDATA FIRST :STUFF
PATCH BF :STUFF
END


The preceeding procedures set the printer to the default conditions
on page 4-10, table 4-3 of the Bare 800 manual, with the following
exceptions:

Auto linefeed with carriage return in ON.

To send a font to the printer, use a version of PATCHC which doesn't
send the 27 before every comand.
