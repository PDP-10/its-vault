USE STUDY

The following is a study of 23 cases from the data base, performed in order
to assess the tractability of the current use typology, shown below:

Legal Proposition                       Specific Case

1a. The determination of biological     2. The determination, by means of 
causality as a legal proposition.       theory, of [(biological) ()]
                                        causality in a specific case.
1b. The determination of technical
causality as a legal proposition.

                                        3. The determination of proximate

will exist to meet a legal              or will exist to meet a legal 
requirement.                            requirement.



Examples:

AMAX FLY ASH (MITDB#119) is a patent case in which action was brought for
unauthorized use of an invention.  The defendant contends that his claim is
obvious under patent law, since the method outlined in the patent is
similar to methods covered by two prior patents and outlined in a Burequ of
Mines report.  This issue of "obviousness" does not lend itself to the
typology, but is best described by category 3, proximate cause.


In SOCIETY OF THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY v OSHA (509 F2nd 1041 (1975)
MITDB#120), petitioners claim that no proof exists in the record to justify
a 1 ppm exposure level for VCM, since testimony indicated that a threshold
level has not been established.  This issue might fit category 2, except
for the fact that the issue pertains to a legal proposition, not a specific
party in interest. The category 1a does not indicate the inconclusive
nature of the mechanism involved (a theory).

In PLASTICS, petitioners rely on the Snell Report (economic impact study
prepared by an independent consultant at the request of the Secretary) to
support their contention that the standard could not be attained through
engineering means.  A category 4 issue.

Petitioners also cite the report as support for their contention that the
standard is economically infeasible under OSHA.  This is a category 4
issue.

In UPJOHNvFINCH (DB#124), petitioners seek to review order of the FDA
revoking drugs certifications.  One issue is whether there was an
"additional" death associated with one of the drugs in question; i.e., a
death due to complicattions associated with the use of Upjohn's drug.  The
Court cites a letter stating that Upjohn's Panalba drug was the cause of
death.  Upjohn disputes this, stating that death was most likely caused by
the use of another drug (not an Upjohn product) in this case. Category 3.

In U.S.STEEL v. TRAIN (MITDB#125), US Steel seeks review of an EPA order
granting a NPDES permit for the company's Gary works.  One scientific issue
is whether limitations contained in Steel's permit are possible to achieve
with present technology.  Note that the question is: Does the technology
exist now? Category 5 must include the phrase "does exist" to include such
occurences. 

Another issue in STEEL is whether compliance with thermal limitations can
be determined reliably. Note that this issue is not directly used in the
manner described by category 5, but that the thrust of Steel's effort in
raising this issue is described by 5. This issue presents a use assessment
problem.  
 
Steel also asserts that the limitations are unsupported by "accurate data
and analysis and sound scientific principles." The Court objects to the
conclusory nature of this issue, and does not consider it.  Category ?

Steel posits that EPA's method of arriving at limitations is unreliable in
that they disregarded unusually high discharge values obtained in
monitoring Steel's effluent.  EPA defends its method.  This issue is
difficult to categorize. By virtue of its place in Steel's argument, I
assign it (with reservations) to Category 5.

Steel argues that monitoring samples taken during periods of runoff
resulting from rainfall should be disregarded in determining compliance
with the permit limitations.  EPA introduces evidence showing that runoff
would have little effect.  Again, it is difficult to categorize use for
this issue.  Steel is clearly raising points designed to decrease the
apparent validity of EPA's methods, demonstrate the impossibility of
compliance, or obtain concessions through measurement fudging.  Category 5
does not do justice to Steel's use of sci/tech materials.

Steel contends that blast-furnace recycling would not be BPT because EPA
failed to consider thesix facotrs of the Act relating to BPT assessment.
The Court finds it unncessary to deal with this point in light of AMERICAN
IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE vEPA.  It reviews the record anyway, and notes
that EPA did properly consider the factors defining BPT for the STeel
industry as a whole, and for the Gary Works in particular. A category 5.

Steel also argues that recycling would not be BPT because recycling would
cause violations of sulphate limitations.  On review the Court disposes of
this argument. Category 5.

Steel challenges EPA's calculation of attainable TSS reduction, arguing
that the production figure used for outfall #l7 was too low.  The Court
rejects this argument.  Category 5?

Finally, Steel argues that monitoring under permit provisions is too
frequent and too widespread. Steel's proposal for monitoring would, in
effect, allow it a 4.5 mile strech of river to act as a treatment facility.
The Court finds this averse to the spirit of FWPCA and Indiana law.
Further, the Court notes that the program mandated under the permit would
be more expensive than the present program, but would not work an
"unjustified" economic hardship on Steel. Category 5?


In BELL v. GODDARD (MITDB#126), petitioner appeals an order of the FDA
withdrawing approval of DES as a poultry drug.  One issue is whether DES
presents a hazard to humans, considering the amount contained in
caponettes.  The petitioner posits a 1 microgram exposure per capita per
year level. Using a 100:1 safety factor (which petitioner indicates is
common practice) he states that addiitional yearly exposure to DES per
person would be 100 micrograms maximum, an inconsequential amount, in his
view.  Court answers this in part by stating that DES is a carcinogen,
noting the high degree of uncertainty associated with cancer phenomenology.
Category 2.

The petitioner also maintains that estrogen occurs naturally in foods, and
that the exposure from a variety of common foods is greater than the
exposure from caponettes. This, petitioner implies, shows that DES in
caponettes does not pose a hazard. Category 2.

Finally, petitioner contends that estrogen is produced in the human body,
and that the body has a regulatory mechanism, so that excess estrogen is
detoxified in the liver as a natural process.  The Court finds no support in
the record for this contention. Category 2.

The scientific issue in BROOKSvVOLPE (DB#127) concerns the feasibility of
the construction of a particular elevated viaduct.  Brooks, et al, contend
that the viaduct is a feasible and prudent alternative to the adopted road
construction scheme.  Court rejects this position, citing the burden on the
nearby recreation area that would be created; the marked adverse
aesthetics; the increased noise on the valley floor; and numerous technical
considerations.  The Court concludes that proposed alternatives would
create more problems than the adopted plan. This is a category 3 issue.
However, the language of category 3 must be amended to include instances of
"inference" as well as "causality". "Proximate cause" comprises too narrow
a spectrum of issues to be useful (or accurate) in practice.


In SIERRA CLUBvMORTON, petitioners bring action to prohibit the sale of oil
and gas leases by the DOI in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. One issue: Does
the EIS adequately describe the present environment? Here, plaintiffs
contend that the Statement lacks baseline studies of air and water quality,
and detailed geological data.  The Court finds this contention baseless.
This is an issue of technological inference in a specific case. Category 3.

Sierra Club also contends that the EIS inadequately describes the impact of
oil spills.  The Club criticizes Interior's use of arbitrary values
assigned to oil spills of various magnitudes.  Category 3.


In CITY OF NORTH MIAMIvTRAIN, the city brought action against EPA to
prevent the EPA from approving application by county for funds to construct
water treatment facilites. One issue--Do discharges from septic tanks,
package treatment plants and ocean outfalls presently threaten the health
and welfare of citizen of Dade County?  EPA contends that there is a
threat; plaintiffs disagree.  Court finds that the City is merely
attempting to raise issues of fact in an attempt to defeat summary
judgment. This issue is used in the determination of inference or causality
in a specific case. Category 3.

Another issue--Will major reductions in total loadings of contaminants to
the ocean, considering future growth, be accomplished?  This is a question
of prediction in a specific case.  No category presently exists for this
purpose.  The old Category 5 (prediction of consequences) included this
instance. Such instances must either be included in the present categories
4 and 5, or new categories must be formed.  This analyst would prefer an
integration into the current 4 and 5, in view of the contextual ties
between various predictive issues.

EPA says that implementation of the plan will eliminate the present threat,
while the plaintiff disagrees.  Again, a predictive issue. Category 5?

The EPA states that extension of ocean outfalls will enable more rapid
assimilation of discharge by the action of the Florida current of the Gulf
Stream.  The plaintiff challenges.  Evidence supports the EPA's view.
Category 5?


CITY OF ROMULUS v. COUNTY OF WAYNE (MITDB#132) is a case in which the city
and various citizen groups bring action to enjoin the construction of a
proposed airport runway. One issue--Are the demand figures in the EIS
misleading in view of the downturn in commercial air passengers since 1971?
This issue is used in the determination of technological inference in a
specific case.  Category 3.

Another issue--Are the demand figures based on erroneous assumptions,
including unlimited supplies of jet aircraft fuel and an elastic demand
curve irrespective of fare increases? A full description of this issue is
not possible. Category 3?

Plaintiffs contend that demand figures should have been based on passenger
demand rather than on the number of operations. Category 3?

Issue 4--Is the conclusion that the existing runway configuration is
rapidly approaching saturation unsupported by the data in the EIS? The Court
agrees with this assertion.  Category 3.

The plaintiffs argue that the conclusion that the hourly capacity of the
airport will be increased by 50% in 1976 is misleading.  The Court agrees
that several factors make this conclusion of the EIS "less than adequate."
This is a predictive issue.  Category 5?  Or should another predictive
category be established? Or is this issue non-prognostic--Category 3?

The plaintiffs claim that delay figures are based on an obsolete and
inadequate projection of the fleet mix.  The Court finds "unexplained
inconsistencies in the fleet mix" used in the EIS.  Category 3?

Another issue--Should the delay chart predicted by computer have been
verified by computer modelling?  There is little description of this issue.
Category 3?

Plaintiffs assert that the choice of 85dbA as a threshold of
unacceptability is arbitrary in view of present knowledge of the
deleterious effects of noise on man.  Court concurs with the opinion of an
expert witness, who said that the choice of threshold was higly misleading
and did not conform to what is known of the effects of hoise on humans.
This issue is used in a determination of technological-environmental
inference, in a "forefront science" context.  Category 2.  As an aside,
note that category 2 should include forefront technological, as well as
medical, issues.

The plaintiffs also criticize the results of the noise study in the EIS,
contending that several different noise level contours should have been
presented in order to adequately assess the acceptability of noise impact.
Should this issue be categorized as type 3, or does it fall into type 2?

The plaintiffs question the assumption that in l980, the fleet will be
fitted with quieter engines.  The Court finds that this assumptin is not
misleading or unwarranted. Category 3?

Another issue in Romulus concerns the Composite Noise Rating (CNR) maps for
the year 1980.  Plaintiffs take exception to the inadequate nature of this
data.  The Court--"A more basic defect [in the CNR maps] is the total lack
of information as to what the CNR...maps mean in terms of an acceptable
human envrionment."  This also presents a difficult categorization task.
Category 3? or 2?


In AMERICAN MEAT INSTITUTE v EPA (DB#134) , organizations of slaughter- and
packinghouses petition for review of EPA-promulgated regulations.  One
issue--Will the magnitute of the effect of winter temperatures on anaerobic
laggon effectiveness render compliance impossible?  Category 4.

Another issue in MEAT is the effects of summer on aerobic laggons?
Category 4.  The scope of these issues extends beyond the parties at issue.

AMI argues that the results from one test plant are so low as to reaise
questions as to the reliability of EPA methodology.  This is an issue
indirectly used in category 4.  

AMI also questions the reliability of data obtained from tests at the Iowa
Beef plant.  Category 4.

EPA's data from a Swift plant is called into question by AMI.  Category 4.

AMI questions the reliability of the process used to establish TSS
limitations for complex slaughterhouses.  Category 4.

AMI also criticizes three suggested methods of achieving the 1983
standards.  Category 4.


In AMERICAN PAPER INSTITUTE v TRAIN, manufacturers petition for review of
EPA regulations establishing limitations guidelines for five subcategories
of the unbleached phase of the paper industry.  One issue is whether EPA
failed to set attainable New Source Performance Standards.  Category 4.

Another issue in PAPER is whether EPA was deficient in its cost-analysis
for NSPS for color.  This issue lies is indirectly used in type 4.


In AMERICAN FROZEN FOOD INSTITUTE v TRAIN, manufacturers petitioned to
review an order of EPA.  A major issue is whether the limitations whould
have provided for variability in operation.  The Court finds this argument
to be baseless. Category 4?


In DC v TRAIN, D.C. petitions for review of an action of the Administrator
of EPA.  Plaintiffs challenge the validity of Vacuum Spark Advance
Disconnect regulations on the basis of cost-benefit ratio.  Category 3? or
5?

Plaintiffs also challenge the Heavy-Duty Vehicle Retrofit programs on the
basis that information claimed to be needed to promulgate regulations was
lacking.  Category 5?


In MAD v TRAINOR (DB#138), action was brought for injunction against the
opening of bids for construction on a highway.  Petitioners contest the
reliability of the traffic projections used.  The concept of "generated"
traffic is used.  The Court concludes that, given the general disagreement
of experts concerning "generated" traffic concepts, the uncertainty
involved in producing models of this type, the agency determinations must
be upheld.  A forefont Civil Engineering issue.  Category 2.

Petitioners also challenge the validity of 4 specific factors used in the
EIS .  Category 3.

Petitioners criticize the CO analysis described in the EIS.  Court
concludes that, given the "room for reasonable scientific disagreement" on
the subject of atmospheric stability choices, there was no "clear error" in
the study on this point. Category 2.

Another issue concerned the proper method to be used to calculate POX
levels?  A conflict emerged as to the proper mehtod.  The Court found that
as no evidence "bears directly on a resolution of this conflict...and the
Cort has strong doubts that [either method] can properly be utilized...the
point need not be resolved..."  Category 2.

Finally, peitioners contend that the results and methodology employed in
the 3-C(Continuing, Comprehensive, Cooperative planning) process to
evaluate the environmental impact are so unreliable as to render the
decision to proceed a clear error.  The Court, after lenthy analysis,
concludes that the methodology was within the state of the art.  Category
2.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

Categories 1a and 1b should be consolidated.  The examples above show that
technological issues may be characterized by as much uncertainty as
biological ones, obviating the theory that the two types should be
separated.  Additionally, consolidating the two types will render practical
application more feasible.

The creation of a new category is necessary: "The determination, by means
of theory, of [] causality as a legal proposition." This category will be
the counterpart of the current category 2.

The phrase "does exist" should be added to categories 4 and 5.

The word "causality" may be too narrow for practical application.
"Inference or causality" might be substituted.

Predictive issues must be covered by the use typology, either as new
categories, or in new language in categories 4 and 5.

Regarding the substantive differences between current categories 2 and 3:
Category 2 refers to forefront science issues, while category 3 describes
established, or "old" science issues.  On this point, the views of McGovern
and Ashford are, I believe, in agreement.  

In category 2 issues, a choice is made between causal models of unproven
(sci-tech) validity. In category 3 issues, a choice is made between models
of established validity.   In category 3, the decision-maker faces one (or
several) causal models, each positively known to operate under certain
circumstances.  The task here is to decide which set of circumstances is
indicated by the evidence; then, which (if any) model is consistent with
these circumstances. In category 2, the decision-maker faces one (or
several) causal models which have not been scientifically established
beyond all doubt. A decision here is based on choices associated with
scientific uncertainty. (Whether this implies greater judicial uncertainty
remains to be seen.) The decision-maker again chooses which (if any) model,
but in this category, each model of causality is unproven in the
scientific sphere.

The distinction between 2 and 3 is not always easy to make.  Certain issues
involve sci-tech material which falls between the levels of uncertainty
implicit in the categories.  Nonetheless, the distinction is useful and
necessary to the study.  I believe it will be amenable to trial as well
as regulatory-administrative approaches.
