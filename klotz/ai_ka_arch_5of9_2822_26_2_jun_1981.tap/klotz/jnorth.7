2DAVID JACOBS*

	In the summer of 1979, while seeking material for an
interdisciplinary undergraduate thesis, I joined the newly-formed
"Uses of Scientific and Technical Material in the Courts" project at
MIT's Sloan School of Management.  This effort, funded by the
National Science Foundation, is an exploratory analysis of 150 federal
court opinions.  Its purpose is to investigate problems associated
with the use of scientific and technical evidence in the federal
courts.  My work on this project led me to pursue the J. D. degree.
	Members of the project group compiled federal court cases involving
scientific issues.  This data base comprised regulatory, product
safety, discrimination, and criminal cases.  I analyzed the opinions,
identifying parameters such as standard of review, engagement,
legislative or adjudicative implications, and field of science, as
outlined in Professor J. D. Nyhart's preliminary analysis guide.  I
revised sections of the analysis guide, improving its clarity and
descriptiveness.
	Supplementing traditional legal research methods with
innovative techniques, I created a LISP (LISt Processing) computer
program to facilitate manipulation of the data base.  This program
enables group members to correlate parameters of different cases.  It
graphically displays trends in the data, and expedites the testing of
models.
	To study the relationship between the outcome of a scientific
issue and the context in which relevant scientific evidence is used, I
developed a parameter called "use."  Use describes the function of the
scientific material at issue by classifying its scientific
uncertainty, and its legislative or adjudicative implications.  Use
indicates the purpose for which scientific evidence is introduced; it
also indicates how science is used.  When correlated with standard of
review and engagement, use yields a model for the role of scientific
material in the legal decision-making process.  This model relates the
parameters of an issue to its outcome, and provides a diagnostic tool
for studying court decisions involving science.  It is documented in
my final report.
	My survey of cases shows that lawyers have a unique
opportunity to be at the locus of public policy's intersection
with science.  Legal decisions involving science affect the
implementation of policy for energy, transportation, occupational
safety, and the environment.  A lawyer may confront issues of
controverted science with far-reaching societal consequences, as in
1Reserve Mining v. EPA.  *In 1Reserve*, the outcome of geological
and biological issues determined the quality of the air and water of
communities near Reserve's iron mining complex.
	The opinions in our data base contain complex scientific and
legal issues addressed by federal courts.  The issues demonstrate the
need for lawyers schooled in science and technology.  As society's
demands on technology increase, so too will demand for the
technologically literate lawyer.
	The work described above influenced my decision to study and
practice law.  For the purpose of providing a more complete
description of my personal history, I will mention two of the
principal forces in my cultural development:  music, and my ethnic
heritage.  My study of music began at the age of five, with the piano.
I attended the Julliard School's preparatory division, and began the
study of the violin.  I continue to perform with local chamber groups.
	My background is Hispanic-American.  Born in New York City, I spent my
earliest years at my grandfather's home near Barranquilla, Colombia.
I retain familial ties with this land:  When my parents
divorced in 1977, my mother returned to Colombia.  
	During the l980's, Hispanics may become the largest minority
in the United States.  I support efforts to increase the
representation of Hispanics in the legal profession.  I would like to
explore the legal questions affecting Hispanic-Americans; among my
professional goals is the incorporation of bicultural skills in
providing legal services to Hispanics. The cooperative legal education
program provides practical experience that will focus my interests in criminal
and administrative law; it offers me the opportunity to bring scientific
and bicultural perspectives to classroom and employment settings.
