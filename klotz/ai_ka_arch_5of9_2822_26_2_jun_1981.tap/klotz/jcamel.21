	Humans have lived in the Andes at least 25,000 years.  It is believed
that they came over the Bering strait isthmus from Asia, and migrated
all the way from Alaska to the Andes, a distance of at least 4000
miles.  The earliest remains of men that have been found in Peru are
along the central coast, in the lower Chillon Valley.  This site has
been dated to about 12,000 B.C.  The highlands, at this time, were
caught in the last stages of glaciation.  People apparently moved up
to these altitudes only after the mountain glaciers had retreated far
enough to make this zone habitable.  (Lanning,'6l).  The earliest
sites in the highlands have been dated to about 10,000 B.C.  The
people who occupied these sites were hunters and gatherers who
subsisted mainly by hunting deer and camelids.  Camelids were very
important to these early inhabitants, and, as I will show, have
remained a vital part of Andean life even to the present day.

	It is useful to be acquainted with some basic facts about camelids and
their habitat in order to understand why these animals came to be so
important to the inhabitants of the Andes.  First of all, the
camelids' native habitat is the Puna, a vast, relatively (compared to
the rest of the Andes) flat grassland.  It lies between 3800 and 4600
meters in altitude and extends unbroken for hundreds of miles in the
Central and Southern Peruvian Andes.  It is very cold; the diurnal
temperature variation can exceed 30 degrees, and nightly frosts can
occur at any time of year.  In some places the Puna is scattered with
lakes, marshes and rivers, which provide a year round water supply for
the fauna and flora.  Little but grass grows naturally at this
altitude, and this is what the camelids eat. 

	There are four species of camelid:  llama, alpaca, guanaco, and
vicuna.  The llama and alpaca have been domesticated; the guanaco and
vicuna have not.  All four species are quite similar, differing mainly
in size and hair quality.  Llamas are the largest, averaging 115
kilograms in weight;  alpacas weigh about 90 kilograms, and vicuna and
guanaco are even smaller.  All the species can interbreed to produce
fertile offspring;  and since they often share territories,
interbreeding does happen occasionally.  The camelid species can share
territory without competing for food, because they have slightly
different dietary and habitat preferences.  For example, the alpaca
favors marshy, lower lying areas, while the llama prefers higher,
dryer ground.

	All species share the same form of social organization.  Only the
vicuna still exists in the wild state in any numbers, so most of the
data on camelid social organization has been generalized from studies
of the vicuna.  Camelid social organization consists of two groups of
animals:  the band, which includes one male guarding five to ten
females and the juvenile offspring, and the troop, which is composed
of up to one hundred single males.   Bands live in set territories
which the dominant male will defend against male intruders.  Troops
live at the edges of band territories, and the single males will
attempt to steal, or at least mate with, the band females.  Depending
on the productivity of the land (which can vary greatly from place to
place due to the underlying rock formations, soil cover, and wetness),
a herd of 50 to 125 animals requires about 1 square kilometer of Puna.
(Browman, 1974).

	Camelid fertility rates are low; between 50 to 70% of mated adult
females give birth.  The low rate appears to be caused by spontaneous
abortion in the first month of pregnancy.  Infant mortality rates
are high; about 25% of the neonates die in the first three months of
life.  These factors produce a population that remains stable without
curbing by many natural predators. 

	Once the basic facts are known about camelid physiology and society,
theories can be constructed to explain their increasing significance
in Andean life.  Why did the early hunters eventually domesticate the
llamas and alpacas?  When did they do it?  These questions have been
answered using data from archaeological digs in the highlands.
Preceramic men who dwelt in the puna lived in caves and rockslides
where they could take shelter from the elements.  Many caves in
favorable areas were in constant occupation for thousands of years,
and can provide us with unbroken dating sequences.

	Studies of these caves, concluded in the past ten years, have provided
data from which conclusions can be drawn about the circumstances of
camelid domestication.  This work was done in the central Andean Puna.
A model proposed by Jane Wheeler Pires-Ferriera suggests that there
were four stages of domestication that took humans from hunting
camelids to herding them.

	The first stage of this model extends from about 10,000 B.C. to about
5500 B.C.  The first humans who lived in the Puna during this period
were hunter-gatherers.  Since there was little that humans could eat,
plants provided a very limited biomass for human consumption.
Because camelids efficiently convert grasses to assimilable proteins, the
people were primarily hunters.  They ate rodents, fish, birds, deer,
and camelids.  They apparently also ate equines and mammoths for some
time.  These animals were long extinct in most parts of the world, but
pockets of them seem to have lasted much longer in the Andes.  These
people had what is termed a "generalized hunting economy"; that is,
they hunted without making any effort to obtain anything in
particular, and this is reflected in fossil remains.

	Stage II dates from 5500 B.C. to 4200 B.C.  People who lived in this
period had a "specialized hunting economy."  Camelid bones composed
84% of the faunal remains.  This suggests a heavy dependence upon the
camelid for food.  A knowledge of camelids' social organization and
habits helped humans hunt more efficiently.  Humans lived
in groups of about 25, and needed about 250 square kilometers to
support themselves.  This land area would support many bands and
troops of camelids; as long as the hunters harvested less than 20% of
the camelid population per year, both human and camelid populations
would remain stable.

	Stage III dates from about 4200 to 2500 B.C.  During this period, the
use of camelids increased even more, with camelid bones accounting for
88% of the faunal remains.  It is hypothesized that humans began to
exercise more control over the camelid population by regulating their
yterritory; humans had not yet regulated camelidBxreap breeding.
These animals were "semi-domesticated;" wild camelids still interbred
freely with the semi-domesticates.  Camelid herds are relatively easy
to domesticate.  Although camelids are shy, once one or two dominant
animals are domesticated, the rest of the herd will soon follow.

	The final stage, IV, took place between 2500 to 1750 B.C., and is
termed "complete domestication."  Camelid bones now comprised 92% of
the faunal remains.  Humans now took complete control over both camelid
territory and breeding.  Llamas and alpacas could now be bred for
characteristics such as hair color, size of animal, and hair quality.

	Camelids were a stable, productive, and non-seasonal resource that
comprised the core of preceramic highland-dwelling human diet.  Their
year-round availability made it unnecessary for human groups to leave
the puna at any season.  The early hunters had a reliable food
source that they were unlikely to abandon.  Humans could be sedentary, not
nomadic, because of the availability of the camelids.  In sum, the
social and territorial characteristics of wild camelids were key
elements both in the development of a specialized hunting economy from
the earlier generalized pattern, and in the origin of human control
over these territories, which led to the appearance of
semi-domesticated animals.  Increasing territorial control resulted in
increased breeding control and the development first of domesticated
camelids, and thereafter, of specialized breeds (Wheeler
Pires-Ferriera, 1974).

	It is obvious from studies of faunal remains that camelids were
becoming increasingly important to the human population.  This was
because man found many uses for them, other than as food. Andean
camelids are a major strategic resource, now and in the past,
providing products that are usable and valuable both in local Andean
and worldwide industrial economies.  I will confine myself mainly to a
discussion of the four major camelid assets: dung, wool, meat, and
cargo capacity.

	As beasts of burden, camelids had no competition in pre-conquest Peru.
They were the only animal suited for carrying cargo.  Once
domesticated, llamas were pressed into service carrying goods from
village to village.  Llamas can carry a maximum of forty-five kilograms for
about 25 kilometers per day.  Their ability to graze on sparse pasture
makes them irreplaceable at high altitudes.  Male llamas are more
often used as cargo carriers, and are sometimes castrated to make them
stronger and more docile.  Yearly trading caravans were common in the
Pre-Inca highlands.  Llamas carried goods and produce, and could be
sold or eaten in times of famine.

	Dung was a very important resource in the Andean economy.  The puna
has a low energy availability; there is little or no wood for fuel,
and the soil is nutrient poor in many places.  Camelid dung was used
as fuel, both for cooking and for warmth.  The animals are brought to
corrals at night, and dung is collected when they leave the next
morning.  Dung provides an intense, smokeless fire that is,
unfortunately, difficult to keep lit.  

	Modern families prefer cattle dung as fuel, but this was not available
before the Spanish invasion.  These families maintain small herds of
animals, and cultivate small plots of land, much as the typical
highlander has done for thousands of years.  The people graze their
animals on the fallow plots of land, and the animals defecate on it,
fertilizing the soil by concentrating important elements such as
nitrogen, phosphorus, and magnesium.  A modern Quechua family requires
approximately 100 animals to provide enough dung for both fuel and
fertilizer. (Winterhalder, Larsen, Thomas 1974.)

	Camelid meat was used much more extensively when the human population
was lower.  Early groups of hunters must have eaten about one hundred animals
per year, but at present, people eat about 5 llamas per family per
year.  This figure varies widely from area to area, and surely did in
the past also.  The diet of the modern population is supplemented by
agricultural products, but the early hunters depended almost entirely
on meat.  Male alpacas yield about 20 kilograms of meat, females,
about 15 kilograms, and llamas yield 25 to 45 kilograms.  The meat is
used in various ways.  When exposed to the nightly frosts and daily
evaporation, the meat freeze-dries into a sort of jerky called
1charqi0, which is widely used on trips because it is light and
nutritious.  Fresh meat was used in stews, and carcasses were probably
roasted whole on occasion.

	The best-known product of camelids is their fleece.  It comes in a
wide variety of colors, lengths, and finenesses.  Herders breed their
animals carefully to obtain the desired characteristics.  Of the
camelids, it is the Alpaca which is most valued for wool production.
Llama wool is too coarse and sparse, and vicuna wool too scarce, for
these animals to approach the economic importance of the alpaca in the
context of wool production.

	Alpaca fleece is soft, lustrous, and very fine.  Alpacas produce 3 to
5 kilograms when shorn every two years.  It can be white, cream, fawn,
tan, grey, brown, and black.  Many alpacas have piebald coats with
patches of different colors.  Different breeds of alpaca, such as the
1suri0 and 1huacaya0, have different qualities of wool.  Huacaya
wool is curly and crimped, while suri wool is long, straight and lustrous.
Environmental factors affect wool quality; alpacas thrive between 4000
and 5200 meters.  The greater cold at higher altitudes tends to
stimulate wool growth.  Altitudes below 3400 meters are warm enough to
permit the existence of external parasites such as lice and mange,
which make wool short and uneven.  Extreme altitudes make animals
prone to heart ailments, however, so herders are careful to balance
considerations of animals' health with those of wool production.

	Llama wool is coarser than that of the alpaca, and it is extremely
durable.  When sheared every 2 years, llamas yield 2-4 kilograms of
fleece.  Vicuna wool is very fine and extraordinarily soft.  These
animals yield far less fleece than do the llama and alpaca;  the
average yield is often only .25 kilogram per year.  This wool is the
most delicate of all the kinds produced by camelids.  Since the
vicuna have not been domesticated, people hunt them to get their
fleece.  In pre-conquest times, they were rounded up, sheared, and
then set free.  In more recent times they were killed and then
sheared.  At present, vicuna are protected by the Peruvian
government, and small herds live in reservations, much like the North
American Buffalo. Unfortunately, since their wool is still the most
prized, poaching, shearing and smuggling of wool still takes place.

	In many highland communities, virtually all adults know how to spin and
weave, and they make use of this skill, coupled with a wide choice of
camelid fibers, to produce almost all the textiles their families use.
Common products are a rough cloth called 1bayeta0, wide brimmed
felt hats, sacks, ropes, blankets, ponchos, and carrying cloths.  (In
the Andes, cloth is used as we would use paper:  for wrapping food,
carrying things, etc.).

	Camelid products are a source of food, clothing, and warmth.
Camelids play a role in religious ceremonies.  Seed potatoes are
dipped in llama blood to insure their productivity, and aborted
fetuses are examined and used to predict events.  During the Inca
reign, llamas and alpacas were routinely sacrificed to the gods and
the emperor; the dark spot of the milky way was named the Great Llama.

	Owning a herd of llamas and alpacas conveyed esteem in the past, and
still does.  Herders decorate their llamas with bright ear tassels
when going on a journey, and generally value them highly.  The
shepherd's herd is his most valuable possession.  His animals are
usually corralled at night , and pastured during the day.  Shepherds
are usualy children.  They may be male or female.  Adolescents are
given animals as they mature.  A boy may accrue as many as 10 animals
by the time he reaches marriageable age; a girl may receive five.  The
number of camelids one owns has traditionally been a measure of one's
wealth.  They are often given as wedding presents to newlyweds.  Even
with the animals that husband and wife had before marriage, and the
animals given as presents, most newlyweds have relatively small herds.

	The shepherd can identify each animal, no matter how large his herd.
The nomenclature he employs is associated with the technique of
shepherding; its complexity illustrates the importance of the
camelids. A study of the nomenclature of camelids was conducted by
Jorge Flores.  The shepherds discussed in his study live in a region
of the Andes which lies about 4200 meters above sea level.  The
shepherd's system of names allows him to label each animal in his
herd, and aids recovery of lost or stolen animals.

	Shepherds often think of their animals as they would of their
children.  Llamas born on special days, such as Christmas, will be
named after that day, as would a child. Alpacas are called by
feminine diminutives, while male llamas are called 1ninichos0, or
small boys.  Llamas and alpacas may be referred to as 1wiraqocha0,
or "mist."

	Wild camelids are called 1salqa0, and domesticated animals,
1uywa0.  (Uywa also means cattle.)  The wild animals are considered
to be the domesticated animals of the gods. The herd can next be
distinguished by sex.  Shepherds assign more than two sexes to their
animals.  The sterile males are considered to be between male and
female.  Castrated males also fall into an intermediate category.
Similarly, there are intermediate feminine genders, taking into
account fertile and infertile females.

	The quality of an animal's fleece may also serve as a basis for its
name.  Another important criterion of distinction is age.  The terms
used to describe an animal's age reflect not only its chronological
age, but also the quality of its feed, the altitude at which it lives,
the number of children it produced, the quality of its teeth, its
cargo capacity, and other considerations of its health.

	Finally, there is a complex set of names that correspond to an
animal's color pattern.  There are 3 primary groups of colors:
1yuraq0, or white, 1yana0, or black and 1kulur0, or red
(from the Spanish 1color0).  Kulur is the richest color range,
comprising 7 base colors; black and white are monochromatic.  Each
base color in turn comprises tones.  Black and white have two tones
each;  kulur has fifteen.  There are many other tones that not
precisely described by this scheme.  Regional variations add to the
list of color names.

	The animals usually do not have coats of one color. One exception to
this is the commercial herds of animals, which are often of single
colors.  (White wool commands a high price, so there are many
commercial herds of white animals.  Albinos are at an adaptive
disadvantage in the puna, because of genetic weaknesses;  high
mortality rates are observed in these herds.  In any case, the
preferences of major consumers of alpaca fur, especially England,
appear to be moving in the direction of kulur fur.)

	Because many animals have coats of various colors, names can be
assigned according to an animal's patches.  These names may be
categorized according to the predominant color of the animal's fleece,
or according to the color of its patches.  A name may be chosen from
the location of the animal's patches, as we might refer to a
white-booted horse.

	In summary, the shepherd has at his disposal thousands of permutations
of factors by which to choose a name for each of his animals.  The
factors include an animal's birthday, sex, quality of fleece, age, and
color. (Flores.)

	The study of modern herding techniques shows us how the ancient
Andeans may also have solved the problem of identifying and
classifying their animals.  Unfortunately, we know very little about
the herding practices of many ancient Andean civilizations.  The major
exception is the Inca.  The Spaniards took note of the number and
distribution of Inca camelids, and with this material, we can
reconstruct the herding practices of the Inca.  

	Several types of herds existed within the Inca empire.  Families owned
small herds, just as they do now, and used them to provide for their
needs.  Villages kept larger communal herds, which provided meat for
fiestas and for the poor, wool for tribute to the gods and the ruler,
and insurance against famine;  hungry people can either eat camelids,
or barter them for other food items.  Shrine-herds were kept by the
priests, left unshorn, and used in sacrifice to the gods.  Finally,
state-herds, the largest type of herd, were property of the Inca
royalty.  These animals were used as pack animals for provisioning the
army.  They were also given as rewards to good soldiers, and wool from
them was woven by state weavers into garments for the use of the
empire.  Wool from the state herds was also given to each household so
that it could weave the yearly garment that the empire required in
1mit'a0.  State herds were composed of thousands of animals.  At the time
of the Spanish Conquest, 150,000 animals were counted in the Lake
Titicaca area.

	The Spaniards brought horses, goats, sheep, and cattle with them.
These animals were not adapted to life in the puna.  They cropped the
pasturage too short, and crowded out the camelids.  However, as
evidenced by the important role of camelids in modern Andean life,
these imported animals could not replace the llama and the alpaca.

	The llama, the alpaca, and, to a lesser extent, the vicuna, have been
a major asset to the puna dwelling population.  These animals have
been utilized for at least 14,000 years, and although the uses to
which they have been put have changed, the fact remains that camelids
are still aiding man's survival.  They furnish food and fiber, and
carry loads.  They helped keep the Inca empire functioning, and now
their wool is important not only to highland herders, but also to a
world export economy.  These animals have proved a versatile resource
for the puna people, who have been dependent on them since they first
began to domesticate them.  The Andean not only values his herds, but
holds a great affection for the animals as well.  As one of Flores'
shepherds said, "Llamas...they are like my children."
