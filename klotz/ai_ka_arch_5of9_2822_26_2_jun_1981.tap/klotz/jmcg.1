This is an examination of McGovern's use typology.

McGovern's categories are based on levels of generality--the
generality of the legal principle involved in an issue of controverted
science.  McGovern considers both the applied legal proposition (in
his categories 2 and 3) and the generated legal proposition (his
category 1).  

Category 1: Causality as a Legal Proposition.  This is
the use of science and technology to establish a relationship which
rises to the level of a general legal principle.  This is the concept
of a generated legal proposition; the proposition is generated from
the causal relationship.  

Category 2: Causality in a Specific Case.  This is the application of
a general legal proposition to a specific entity, or subject matter,
which may arise in a variety of circumstances.  The important point
here is the consideration of the scope of application of the science.
This category comprises issues in which the science applies to a
specific subject matter over a range of circumstances.  Example:The
use of a particular scientific test to prove that asbestos causes
cancer.  The use of the phrase "specific case" is misleading; the
subject matter involved may arise in other cases.  

Cagtegory 3: Cause and Effect in a Specific Case.  This category
comprises the application of a general legal proposition concerning
specific subject matter to a specific set of facts in order to
determine proximate cause.  This category represents the most specific
application of a legal proposition.   

In these categories, legal propositions governing the science are
generated by category 1 issues.  Categories 2 and 3 then develop
quasi-specific and specific applications.  Is time ordering implicit
in this scheme? That is, for a particular subject matter, must cases
with category 1 issues precede cases with categories 2 and 3 in order
for an applicable legal principle to exist?

The Science: In category 1, the scientific/technical information has
these properties: generally applicable association, time ordering, and
a legally recognized general application.

Category 2: Science information has these properties in category 2:
"high level of association," time ordering, and application to a
specific subject matter in a broad range of circumstances. "High level
of association" is unclear in this context.

Category 3: The nature of scientific information in this category is
not discussed.


In summary:

Science                         Law

1.Recognized at law to have     Use of science to extablish causal
general application.            relationship that rises to the
                                level of a general legal principle.
                                GENERATED legal proposition.

2. Applies to specific subject  Application of a general legal 
matter over a range of          proposition to a specific subject
circumstances.                  matter which may arise over a range
                                of circumstances.

3.  ?                           Application of a general legal 
                                proposition concerning specific
                                subject matter to a specific set
                                of facts.


Note the congruence of the respective levels of generality of legal
and scientific aspects. Although the scientific context in category 3
was not developed, I expect it would follow this trend.
