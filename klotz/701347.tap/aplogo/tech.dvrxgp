Å PShalom,
Å P
Å PI would like to request some information concerning the Technion University.  I have
Å Pjust finished my freshman year at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and I would like
Å Pvery much to attend the Technion for my junior year.  It would be much appreciated if you
Å Pcould supply me with some of the information I will need, such as a catalog of course
Å Pdescriptions, a procedural description for foreign student enrollment, housing info,
Å Petcetera.  Perhaps you could put me in touch with someone there who I could discuss matters
Å Pwith. I am trying to find some people here at M.I.T. who are familiar with the Technion
Å P(I hear there are quite a few), maybe you could help?
Å P
Å PI studied at the Technion for three weeks in the summer of 1977, on the SSTP program
Å Pof the American Zionist Youth Foundation, so I'm sort of familiar with the Institute, and I
Å Pspent a total of six weeks in Israel, so I have a good impression of what it might be like to
Å Pspend a year there.  Of course, there's a lot I suppose I should find out, anyway, like how
Å Pwell I should know Hebrew, and if I should try to get a job - I'm hoping that you can give
Å Psome advice in this area.
Å P
Å PIf you would like to forward a copy of this letter to the Technion, please do, I'd
Å Pappreciate it.  I'm planning on graduating from MIT in 1983 with an S.B. degree in Computer
Å PScience and Engineering, and another in Philosophy.  I'm currently working in a laboratory doing
Å Pcomputer programming for education-related projects.  My future career will most likely be in
Å Pthe computer science field, although I will pursue my philosophy studies further, also.  I am
Å Pvery interested in world politics and the present situation, especially in affairs concerning
Å PIsrael, and I'm really excited about seeing the country again.
Å P
Å PI look forward to your reply, and thank you very much for your cooperation.
Å P
Å PSincerely yours,
