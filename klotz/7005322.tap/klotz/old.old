Hi.  Does this still work?

How's the chives and related plants?

I'm a student.  They call me a junior, but I'm not going to graduate
next year.  This year I'm taking the second-semester (vector) calculus
course and the second semester (electromagnetics) physics course.

There are 500 people in 8.02, mostly freshmen who advance placed the first
physics course (mechanics).  18.02 is actually 18.02U, with 20
upperclassmen, formed especially to keep the upperclassmen out of the math
class with all the freshmen who AP'd 18.01 and think it's wonderful.

The physics lectures, when I go to them, are the best.  The lecturer is
from Norway, and is a tall, big, man with grey hair.  His thesis advisor
at MIT was van de Graaf.  The one with the generator.  He blows up
capacitors while talking about the "electric veeeld wektr" in stentorian
tones.  I think he alters his vowels sometimes on purpose to keep people
interested, and to give them something to associate the various laws with.
"The electric veeeld points dune," he says, gesturing with his hand.
"This Couloumb's Law equation gives the sum of the charges IN-SIDE the
surface.  Now dohn't forget about that IN-SIDE."  I must have heard that
50 times.  Unfortunately, I forgot it on the test.  Actually, I remembered
the "inside" part but forgot the left-hand side of the equation.

Patrick's taking these two courses also.  He's taking two literature
courses in addition, but I'm just taking the third semester of Japanese.
We should be working at Terrapin also on Logo in C.  I fixed the terminal
at home yesterday so I can work form home again, since Terrapin isn't on
the way to or from anywhere anymore.  I'm having less trouble than Patrick
on some parts of the physics now that we're getting into higher things
like resistors and capacitors since I have intimations of how these things
work based on recollections of early childhood.  But then I don't know
much about magnets so I'm out of it again now for a while.

I have a Japanese mid-term Friday, and an oral interview for it tomorrow.
"Hai, I moved to Cambridge about 5 years ago and study computer science."
Usually in class I manage to say weird or unexpected things once or twice
a day.  Sometimes I argue with the instructor in Japanese.  He didn't like
me for a while because I skipped about half of the first three weeks of
class.  I think he has a better opinion of me because I manage to say
things other than, "Yes, I saw a movie and studied with friends over the
weekend."  Once I had to explain Logo -- it took about five minutes.

They have a neat use of the passive voice.  I'm sure it can be better
understood as some sort of transformation or compound verb involving the
rest of the sentence.  The passive is used to indicate that the subject
was inconvenienced by the action that occurred.

	I was played the piano by Mary.

is really something more like

        I was Mary-piano-played.

with the same sort of feeling as

	I was robbed.

When coupled with the causitive verb construction (you can keep piling
verb endings on -- somethat that apparently comes from Proto-Altaic or
whatever, since Turkish has it) it's used to say things like "I was made
to wash the dishes." but with a distinct tone of displeasure or
inconvenience.  

Just another weirdness I thought I'd report.

Some people left MIT (graduate students and such who graduate) and formed
a company called Voice Technology Corp., here in Cambridge.  They have
apparently just completed a device which recognizes connected spoken digits
speaker-independently.  What more could the Phone Company hope for?
Unfortunately, they can't use it to replace information operators, but
with speaker-independent digit recognition they should able to replace
every single customer who calls directory assistance...

Kurzweil, the comany which developed the Kurzweil reading machine for the
blind years ago has announced they're planning a voice-operated typewriter
with 99%+ recognition rate, speaker independent.  They haven't
demonstrated anything.  Popular Electronics (now called Electronics &
Computers) ran a big article that I keep seeing reprints of, but nowhere
in the article does the author say she saw it demonstrated.  They claim
90% currently, or something like that.  Susumu Kuno from Harvard is
supposedly consulting for them.  I noticed he's on leave this year.  He's
the dude with the Japanese <-> English translation stuff ten years ago or
so.

I have some sort of allergy.  I've been sneezing for about a month.
Either I'm allergic to Caryl and her friend Robin who live here now, or
Krymm left lots of dust in his room which I constantly stir up.  That
seems to fit, so I've stopped making a commotion in my room (as if my room
were the site of any commotion in the past year or two) and don't sneeze
so much.  I've ordered a small electrostatic air cleaner and have an
appointment with the mit allergy people tomorrow.  I've always had trouble
with large amounts of dust.

I should probably sleep now so I can go the appointment tomorrow and take
my mid-term too.  There's about 10 or 20 characters I might have to write
or read or something that I don't know well...but that's for friday anyway.

Let me know what's up sometime, and I'll reply sometime.  Any word on a
visit to the states?  Are you voting?

Leigh.
