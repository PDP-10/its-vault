Large Scale Ideas about what to do for an EMACS release, in no particular
order.

                               EMACS CODE:
DOCUMENTATION:
SRCCOM against current release version and note changes in files.
Note new files, and deleted files.  Try to explain the changes.  Make
notes of unfortunate or problematic changes-- don't change them back.

NEW STUFF:
Find Peter Gergely's new stuff, and possibly his new-new stuff.

Get the latest PASCAL, INTERLISP, and SCHEME libraries from wherever they live.
Get the latest MC libraries (IVORY, BABYL), TMACS.
Get new stuff from Symbolics, if any.

BUGS:
Bug in M-X Compare Windows with same buffer.
Bugs in JUSTIFY library.
 Doesn't work right in general.
 Doesn't come back when you switch buffers.
 Current solution is to eliminate Auto Justify Mode variable
  and use a special value of Auto Fill Mode (-2?)

Make sure DIRED works, on both machines.
Thing about putting in archiving.
Check Dired SRCCOM command.
                                TECO CODE:
Some FS FLAGS have been added.  Document them and see if they work.
Archiving is read-only at the moment, I think.

NEW STUFF:
Look at the non-moving mark stuff, and see if it's OK.
Look at the new TEXTI stuff, which has to be condx'd in based on monitor changes.
Line Saving?
Make FS HSTNAM(?) use SYS:HOSTNAME.TXT if not Arpa site.

BUGS:
Why does Space Indent Flag get set globally from Midas mode?  Changing order
of variable assignments makes it not happen.  The current source on OZ is like
this, but the BBN source isn't -- it's screwed.
