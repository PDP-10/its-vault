Hello.  I don't know if my last message got to you or not.  IBM-SJ
seems to be on some net called Interpod or something like that that
is in the Internet Host-table, but it is unreachable, so it's always
trying to send it to ibm-sj that way instead of they way I tell it to.

How's things?  I'm unsure of whether I'll be in Japan this summer or not.
LCSI is fast trying to take the logo business there away from the company
I worked for in Japan.  Who knows.

I missed class the last two days before the recent holiday (April 15, or
comrade's day or something.

Not much news else.  How does your garden grow?  My younger older sister
is pregnant@35.  The Atari research center Alan Kay had here (remotely,
from California) was closed but they might have a buyer for the outfit.
They wrote a book called the Atari Logo projects book.  Harper, Roe
is publishing it in the fall.  Margaret Minsky is one of the two editors.
I wasn't involved in it, though.  Henry and Julie each have a program in it,
though Henry's was re-written by someone else.  Poor Henry.  His Logo programs
in manuals always say "original implementation by Henry Minsky."

You might see it in print soon.  Now that they're not Atari anymore they
plan to adapt it for Commodore and possibly other machines.  Probably
Commodore because of the large volume, and I suspect LCSI versions
because of the connection.

Well, I'm off to pick up my homework that's due tomorrow.  I'm not learning
much new in 6.032, but just filling out things that I don't quite know.
I suppose it's good.

Rest, and let me know what's up.
Leigh.
