    Note macro bodies are not allowed to be empty.


!Auto Justify Mode:! !C Break lines between words at right margin and justify.
A positive argument turns Auto Justify mode on; zero or negative,
turns it off.  With no argument, the mode is toggled.  When  Auto
Justify mode  is  on,  lines  are  broken  at  the  right  margin
(position controlled by Q$Fill Column$) at spaces, by doing a LF.
Then the paragraph is justified to  that point.  You can set  the
Fill Column with the ^R Set Fill Column.!

!* Auto Justify Mode is on if the variable QAuto Fill Mode contains!
!* -2, and is off otherwise.  Auto Fill Mode is on if it is -1.!

!^R Auto-Justify Space:! !^R Insert space, but if at margin, justify paragraph to that point.
QFill Column controls where the margin is considered to be.
QSpace Indent Flag, if 0, inhibits indenting new lines.
With arg of 0, inserts no space, but may break line.
With arg > 1, inserts several spaces and does not break line.!

!^R Fill Region:! !^R Fill text from mark to point.
QFill  Column  specifies  the  desired  text  width.    An
explicit positive  argument (or  Auto Justify  Mode)  causes
adjusting instead of  filling.  A  negative argument  causes
"un-filling": removal of excess spaces.!
