Abstraction by Procedures/Procedural-based Abstraction

  The human mind/spirit is a thing which operates on simple concepts; the
  workings are made up mainly of the following three elements: 1. We
  create a complex concept by gathering together severaial simple
  concepts into one complex concept.  2. Either simple of complex
  comcepts, by using two of the together at the same time and
  examining them as one we derive the concept known as "relation."  3.
  We form general concepts by understanding them in actual situations
  and moving them to other concepts.  This process is called abstraction.

   John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690)

In this chapter we shall study computing processes (computational
process).  A computational process is an abstract concept ??? on a
computer.  A process, in following its execution?, operates on a
different abstract concept called "data."  The execution? of a process
is handled by a rules called "programs."  In order to control
processes, people write programs; as a result, by this incantation?
we invoke the ?spirit?demon of the computer.

Actually, computing processes are extremely similar to the use of
magic.  You can't see them, you can't touch them, and they aren't
composed of matter.  However, they are quite real.  The can do ? work,
they can answer questions.  Also, they handle money at banks, and move
robot arms around at factories [they used the wrong chinese characters
for factory]; they can influence this world.  The programs we use to
invoke these processes are like the incantations of magic; the work we
want the process to perform is encoded ???
