Sept 14   Sept 21   Sept 28  Oct  5    Oct 12   Oct 19

You should begin reading the text at once: it is "The Society of
Mind", Marvin Minsky, Simon and Schuster, 1986 - available at the MIT
COOP.  Budget plenty of time for this because the reading is a
complicated job.  As explained on page 322, there are too many issues
in making a theory of mind (or brain ) to discusse them all in any
simple, linear way; absorbing this theory requires several passes.  On
a first pass, one might try quickly to read the chapters that attempt
to give overviews - for example, chaps 1-7, 10, 12, 16-18, 22, and 29.
Then read the whole text more carefully. Allow time to stop after each
section, to think and try to write a brief summary of the main idea.
To help focus your attention, we will have a brief written exam on
Nov. 2 in which you will be asked to write a paragraph explaining the
concept of a few terms from the Glossary in pages 326-331.

The written work for the course will consist of 4 essays each of approximately 
1000 words.  (Papers can be longer if suitable constructive.)  During the term 
I will copy and distribute some of these for class discussion.  Each essay 
should theorize about some one of the issues listed below, or something 
similar, employing technical concepts from the Society of Mind theory.  Your 
theory need not agree with mine, but you must present plausible models rather 
than unstructured personal convictions.  Possible essay topics:

  Why does Seeing feel different from Hearing?
  Why does Red seem distinctively different from Green?
  What makes emotions so hard to describe?
  What is Consciousness?  Why is it useful?
  What is the Self?  Does each brain-part have one?
  What are ideas?
  Why do we like Music?
  How do words communicate "meaning"?
  Why do people become infatuated?
  Why do children, but not chimps, learn so much grammar?
  What are goals?
  How do we generalize?
  How much can we remember?
  Why are Jokes funny?
  What is pleasure, and why has it evolved?
  What's wrong with Searle's "Chinese Room" argument?

  Essay 1 due Oct 5.      Essay 2 due Nov 2.     
  Essay 3 due Nov 21.      Essay 4 due Dec 14.

I will usually be available for discussion on Thursday and Friday
afternoons.  Make appointments with Betty Dexter, 253-5864.  If you
have trouble finding me, do not hesitate to call me at home, 734-3363,
only a few minutes from MIT.
