Thanks for the message.  I sent you some mail two days ago but it came back.
I'm trying again with a slightly different address and from a different
computer.

It was good to talk to you on the phone.  I'm wish I had called you
earlier.

I have the calendars you sent me in my room and in my office.

Please say HI to Yoshiaki.  Good luck in your new house.

The Palo Alto interview went well, I think, but I'm not sure.  If all goes
well, I'll be in Japan from 9/89 to 6/90 or so.

What news have you heard about the cold fusion stuff?  I have a copy of
"Observation of Cold Nuclear Fusion in Condensed Matter" by
Jones, Palmer, et.al. from Brigham Young University, but I don't have
a copy of the Pons & Fleischman paper (the exciting one).  If you want
the Jones and Palmer paper, I'll send it to you.  It's about 28,000
characters long.

Love,
Leigh.
