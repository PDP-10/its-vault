We would like to write a letter to the translator, telling then that
we are worried about the quality of the translation.  The best way you
and Mieko could be of help is to write a few paragraphs (in Japanese)
describing the kinds of errors they are making, and maybe going
through the first couple of pages carefully.

I'd like to get together with you and Mieko to talk about this.  I'd
prefer that you and she did just a little work now, rather than
spending lots of time.  If the upshot of our letter is that they redo
large chunks of the translation, there's no point spending a lot of
time on it now.

Mieko --

Thank you very much for agreeing to help with the translation of our
book.  Our publisher, MIT Press, has written a letter to the people at
McGraw-Hill, Japan, saying that we are concerned that there seem to be
many errors.  We are waiting for a reply to that letter.

In the meantime, the most helpful thing you and Leigh could do is to
explain to us what kinds of errors there are, and show us some
examples.  I don't think you should spend a lot of time going in
detail through all three chapters.  Just look at a few sections, so
you can get a general impression of the quality of the translation.

I think that you and Leigh and Julie Sussman and I should get together
this week to discuss what to do next.  How about getting together on
Thursday afternoon around 2:00?

Please send electronic mail to let me know if this is OK.  Also send
copies of all mail to Julie Sussman -- jems@zurich.ai.mit.edu.

Thanks again, 

Hal

     I think to try to find out the kinds of erros in a few sections as possible
     with Nobuyuki's coopration until the meeting.  Can Nobuyuki also attend the 
     meeting?  He seems to have something to help you.

I'd be delighted if Nobuyuki would also come to the meeting, and I'm
grateful for his help.

For your information, here is the letter we are sending to Japan.

Dear Mr. Fujimura,

   We received your letter about a week after the package.
Perhaps when you mail us a package it would be best to include
a copy of the letter in the package.

   None of us can read Japanese, but we do have some colleagues
here who have looked at a few pages for us.  At this point, we
have several questions and comments.

1. Why do you want to publish the book in two volumes (chapters 1-3
in one volume, chapters 4-5 in a separate volume)?  This idea sounds
very strange to us.

2. What is the translation schedule for chapters 4-5?  Has the
translation been started, or are you waiting until you finish 1-3
completely?

3. Why are there no programs in the proofs you sent us?  Will the
programs be left in "English", or will they be translated to Japanese?
If they will be in English, perhaps you have not typed them yet.  If
this is true, it might be very helpful if we send you disks containing
the programs.  Then you would not have to type the programs, and you
would not have to proofread them for errors.  This could save a lot of
time and prevent a lot of errors.  If you want disks, please let us
know.  We can send either MacIntosh disks, or IBM PC-compatible disks.
The PC disks can be either 3 1/2" or 5 1/4" (double-sided,
double-density).

4. What are your plans for proofreading and checking the translation
of chapters 1-3?  It looks to us as if the version you sent us has not
been checked.
   For example, in the acknowledgments, which occupies less than one
page, there are 6 errors in the English (Seymour Papert, Joe Bowbeer,
Richard Stallman, Patrick O'Donnell, Scheme-311, Ira Goldstein).  We
do want to look over the proofs and have the opportunity to make
comments and corrections.  However, we expected to do this review on
proofs that had already been corrected by you.  We did not expect to
do this kind of basic proofreading.  If you do not have the capability
to proofread English, then perhaps we can take the time to do it.  But
if you do have the capability, we do not want to spend our time on
basic proofreading.
   Also, there seem to be many very basic errors in the Japanese.  For
example, sometimes an incorrect word appears, which is pronounced the
same as the correct word.  The first instance of this in chapter 1
occurs in the 9th line of the text (4th line of 2nd paragraph), after
the second comma.  The two characters after the comma mean "improve"
instead of "factory".
   In two or three weeks we will send you some comments by a Japanese
person and an American who knows Japanese.  These comments will point
out many of the errors in the first few parts of section 1.1.  This
should give you a good idea of the kinds of errors we are concerned
about.  But our friends do not have time to check the whole book: They
have other work to do.  We hope that their comments will show you what
you need to work on.

5. You sent us the name of the translator.  But it appears to our
Japanese colleagues that the translation has been done by more than
one person.  How is the translation really being done?  If there is
more than one person, there will be serious problems with consistency
of terminology between chapters (and even in different sections of a
chapter).  (Consistency of terminology was a big problem in the French
translation, which was done by a group of 5 or 6 people.)

6. What are you doing about jokes?  Often jokes cannot be translated.
For example, the joke in footnote 9 that "syntactic sugar causes
cancer of the semicolon" is a pun on the word "colon,"  which is both
a punctuation mark (:) and a part of the body where people often get cancer.
In the French edition, we omitted joke.

7. Shouldn't the translator be directly in touch with us?  Some of
these comments and questions should probably go to him instead of to
you.  Please give him a copy of this letter, and encourage him to
write directly to us to ask us questions.  For example, he may ask us
to explain something in the English that is not clear.  We are very
happy to answer any questions that will help him make a better
translation.

Subject: Japanese translation of S&ICP


Yesterday Hal, Nobuyuki, and I discussed the problems with the
Japanese translation, and Nobuyuki showed us notes written by Leigh.
Nobuyuki was in the process of writing his own notes.  We agreed
on the following actions:

   We would send a letter to Japan immediately.  I have mailed you
a copy of this letter for your information.  It discusses general
issues, without getting into detailed criticism of the translation.

   Nobuyuki will finish typing up his notes.  He is organizing his
comments into categories of errors.

   Leigh and the Hikichis will meet to go over their written comments.
They will produce one set of comments (probably organized by
Nobuyuki's categories) that they all agree on.  This collaboration
will prevent incorrect criticisms due to imperfect understanding
of Japanese by Leigh or imperfect understanding of English by
the Hikichis.

   We will all meet to go over the merged comments.  I will be away
next week (January 8-14), and Hal will be away part of next week and
all of the following week.  So if you are ready the week of the 16th,
I will meet with you (without Hal).  Just let me know when you are
ready, and suggest a time to meet.  In addition to using net mail to
jems@zurich, you should try to call me at 646-6825, because I may not
read my mail frequently.

   Is this agreeable to all of you?

Subject: Japanese

   We all appreciate your help, but we realize that your thesis, not
our book, must be your top priority.  Thus we feel that the best use
of your limited time will be to help us with errors (and types of
errors) in the translation, rather than with style.  Also, it is the
best use of the translators' and editors' time.  Although it would be
nice to have a nice writing style, that is a luxury compared to having
a correct translation.  So, what we need is help in answering the
questions:
 - Is this an acceptable translation?  (Understandable, makes sense)
 - If not, what is necessary to make it acceptable?  (E.g.  correct
certain classes of errors; fix inconsistent terminology; ...)

   That is, we want to ensure that the book is not gibberish, and
is not an embarrassment to us or to The MIT Press.  We hope that
when you meet with the Hikichis you will all bear these priorities
in mind.  Any idea yet when you will meet?
