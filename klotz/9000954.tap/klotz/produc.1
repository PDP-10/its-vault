I think I'll make something called "COMPUTER -- for tomorrow of workers",
which will look like a blue swiss army knife, but will contain a weird
fold-out magnet which is supposed to be used for degaussing your screen,
but actually just results in bending the mask.  the same magnet would have
a sponge on one side that you can dip in vinegar and use to clean the screen.
There would be a little line of conductive material that you could screw
to the chassis so as to avoid zapping yourself.  There would also be a roll
of tape attached; dual-purpose, for splicing tape or patching punshed cards,
and a miniature hexadecimal abacus.  Imprinted into one side would be a 
miniaturized 370 instruction set with hex codes for debugging VM core dumps.
It would be too small to read, but there would be a special magnifying 
glass that you could fold out and use to read the sides.  The other side
would contain a list of BIOS routine addresses.  Needless to say, there
would be a chip puller, a needle-nose pliers, a miniature soldering iron
that ran off penlight batteries, and a tiny roll of soldering wire.

What do you think?  Will it sell?  I'm a little worried about getting the
soldering iron to actually do anything, but I suspect it won't matter.
