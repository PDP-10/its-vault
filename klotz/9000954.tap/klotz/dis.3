Subject: thesis

I have an undated paper (rather bad copy) entitled "Boxer: An
Integrated Personal Computing Environmnet" by the Educational
Computing Group.  Also an undated project report (but it is after
Jeremy's sprite implementation, so must be much later).  Do you really
want such things?  It seems to me you are digging into soup at this
point.  E.g., if this paper is important, what about the memo that I
wrote several years earlier to the Logo group about why Logo was
obsolete (don't remember if any specifically Boxer ideas were in it,
but I think so).  I think I still have that somewhere.  What about the
day I proposed to Hal that we should shoot after the spatial
representation of programming as our central target "because it would
not be as hard as some of the other things we were considering."  I
remember that as critical.  I can't remember who came up with the
name.  Does it matter?  See what I mean? -- "documentation of Boxer's
history" seriously is something you probably are not in a position to
do, so why bother with a concern for historical accuracy/completeness
beyond public documents, your recollections and personal interactions.

(I think it's great your documenting history, a much as
you know it -- just don't think you can hope to do an "in depth," so
shouldn't pretend to.  Your technical contributions are more important.)

Look, I'm really sorry I can't help you more with your thesis.  Two
things: I'm buried; my best guess is you'd be best off listening to
one thesis advisor now (Hal) just to get done.

Let me know how things are going, and if you need particular help,
just ask.
