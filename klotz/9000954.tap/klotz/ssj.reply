title: 130 BOAT PEOPLE BELIEVED LOST IN TANKER COLLISION
author:  DAVID E. SANGER
text: 

       TOKYO -- Japanese officials disclosed Thursday that about 130
Vietnamese refugees are believed to have died earlier this month
when their overloaded boat apparently collided with a Japanese
tanker in the South China Sea.
       The accident occurred March 8, four days after the refugees left
Vietnam in a small fishing boat, the officials said. About 35 of
the refugees were rescued by the tanker, the 240,000-ton Nissei
Maru, as it was on the way to Malaysia.
       ``We have a sketchy outline of what happened,'' said Chikako
Saito, a spokeswoman for the Tokyo office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees. ``But there are conflicting
accounts of what happened.''
       Mrs. Saito said that survivors variously described the fishing
boat as being 27 feet or 51 feet long. When the boat left Vietnam,
they said, it was jammed with 165 people.
       Several of the survivors arrived in Yokohama, just south of
Tokyo, and were transferred to a holding center near Nagasaki in
southern Japan, the officials said.
       The Tokyo Shimbun newspaper reported Thursday that at around 11
a.m. on March 8 the fishing boat sighted the tanker and approached
it, but could not come alongside easily because of rough seas. On a
third attempt to approach the tanker, the fishing boat struck the
propeller of the tanker and immediately capsized.
       More than half of the fishing boat passengers died immediately,
the paper quoted one survivor as saying. ``I myself lost a
7-year-old daughter,'' the refugee was quoted as saying.
       NHK, the quasi-governmental Japanese network, said the tanker
stopped its engines as the boat approached. Officials from Tokyo
Tanker Co., which owns the craft, could not be reached for comment.
       The tanker's sailors threw life vests into the water and by 2
p.m. the fishing boat had reportedly sunk. The 35 survivors were
rescued late that afternoon.

AESTHETIC PERSONAL SOFTWARE TURNS STRESS INTO CREATIVE COMPOSURE
 
Portland, Oregon.  March 1, 1989.  Visionary Software released
"SYNCHRONICITY(TM)," intuitive decision-making software that uses fine art and
soothing sounds to help Macintosh* users turn stress into a calm state of
creative composure.
 
SYNCHRONICITY consists of a series of fine art screens that guide the user
through a personal insight process based on the Book of Changes and the
research of Carl Jung, the famous psychologist, who coined the term.   After 30
years of research, Jung formally discovered and defined "synchronicity" as the
"a causal connecting principle" that lies behind seemingly coincidental events.
 
Visionary Software's product is designed as a practical tool to help reduce the
stress that accompanies tough personal decisions.  "Almost daily, most of us
find ourselves in situations that test our wits, faced with response-choices
that have to made quickly.  Decisions that involve timing, sensitive
relationships, or threats to our security simply do not lend themselves to
logical solutions," said Paul O'Brien, Visionary Software's president.  "That's
where SYNCHRONICITY comes in.  In a playful but serious way, it help users to
calm down, clarify, and resolve dilemmas in their own minds before  reacting.
It does this by mirroring their own natural intuitive insight," he added.
 
Visionary Software chose the Mac as a development platform, because "we
perceived that more creative professionals use that machine than any other.
And creative professionals are most apt to appreciate the benefits of an
intuitively stimulating exercise that's fun to use."
 
SYNCHRONICITY helps users in four ways 1) to achieve greater clarity around a
question, issue, or dilemma; 2) to reinforce skillful detachment by helping
users disengage themselves from situations long enough to reduce the stress and
enhance objectivity; 3) to stimulate intuition, through a response based on a
very wide perspective, for better decisions, and 4) to provide a relaxing but
focused break from the hectic pace of the workday.
 
SYNCHRONICITY accomplishes this in the context of an enjoyable "ritual" that
takes a question and produces a "reading" in response to it.  The reading is
selected on the basis of the unique pattern produced by the user in the ritual
process.  According to O'Brien, "Jung proved that the system really works.
SYNCHRONICITY accomplishes its objectives even if the user doesn't buy into the
literal content of any particular reading.  At the very least, it helps us see
the opportunity in what we may currently be perceiving as a 'problem.'  A tool
that can do that for you, any time you want, is worth a lot more than $49.95."
 
SYNCHRONICITY is immediately available from Visionary Software.   A demo
version of the program is available for $5 including shipping, with full credit
toward purchase.  List price is $49.95 with discounts for students, user group
members, developers, and others who promise to distribute copies of the demo
version.

Note to editors:  Registered and unlocked versions of SYNCHRONICITY are
available to editors at no charge.

title: EAST ST. LOUIS FIGHTS FITFULLY TO SURVIVE
author:  ISABEL WILKERSON
text: 

       EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. -- Across the Mississippi River from the
bustle of St. Louis lies a city so indebted and lacking in basic
services that it evokes comparisons to the Third World.
       East St. Louis has not collected trash in a year. Mounds of
garbage lie uncollected in streets and vacant lots. Its decaying
sewer system has repeatedly backed up, heaving raw sewage onto the
streets and into houses and schools; the flooding and stench have
forced school buildings to close for days at a time.
       The city is $35 million in debt and is facing numerous lawsuits
for defaulting on its loans. It has stopped paying all but the most
crucial vendors, like those that provide gas for its police cars,
and it cannot afford even routine supplies, like soap and toilet
paper for City Hall.
       It is the subject of state and federal investigations into
allegations of mismanagement and reckless endangerment of its
citizens.
       The 308 municipal employees never know when they will be paid,
and must wait up to seven weeks for their paychecks. The city has
had to enlist state troopers to patrol its streets to fight its
worsening drug and gang problems.
       Last fall, as the sewer and debt crises deepened, Gov. James R.
Thompson set up a state group to investigate East St. Louis's
chronic problems.
       In December the panel declared that the city was in ``a state of
fiscal emergency'' and that its prospects for recovery appeared
``remote'' without state intervention.
       The group said East St. Louis needed a substantial loan to meet
its short-term obligations, but added that the state should not
make such a loan the city could identify a source of revenue to pay
it back.
       It recommended a complete fiscal reorganization and a
state-approved officer to sort through the city's jumbled finances.
       The state has set up an advisory board to approve the city's
financial actions. It is not clear where the process will lead.
       Although East St. Louis typifies the decline of many American
industrial cities, economists can think of few if any places where
the problems are so advanced, pervasive and extreme.
       ``It is a partially inhabited ghost town,'' said Charles Leven,
a professor of economics at Washington University in St. Louis.
``It is only in the most incidental sense a city. If it could have
annexed itself to another city, perhaps it would have been saved.''
       
       
        (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)

       
       
       East St. Louis was once a thriving river city, its economy built
on stockyards that fed the Middle West. By 1960, its population was
approaching 100,000. But advances in transportation and storage
caused the stockyards to shrink; many of them closed, and so did
other industries.
       The population fell rapidly. It is now just over 40,000, 60
percent of them on welfare. With the departure of so many
taxpayers, the city has become heavily dependent on state aid.
       To meet its payroll, investigators and some city officials say,
it routinely borrows against uncollected taxes and uses state aid
designated for functions like street repair.
       For the past 10 years, East St. Louis's mayor has been Carl E.
Officer, an aloof, self-confident, third-generation mortician, who
was re-elected two years ago in a race in which three of the 10
candidates were convicted felons.
       Officer, 36, a Democrat, acknowledges the city's financial
troubles but blames the loss of federal revenue sharing and the
hostility of the news media and of state and county officials, who,
he points out, are overwhelmingly white. Officer is black, as are
almost all East St. Louis residents.
       ``You always have people who say that the sky is falling and the
world is flat,'' said Officer. ``I live here; they don't. I'm at
peace with myself. Yes, we have vendors who are not paid on a
timely basis. We don't have a certain schedule. It's just the ebb
and flow of life.''
       Officer says he has a plan to save the city. It hinges on a $473
million riverfront industrial and residential project, to be
financed by industrial revenue bonds.
       The city has spent about $25 million on the project, but the
riverfront is still a bald wasteland, stalled by lawsuits and state
and federal investigations. Other problems aside, the land lies in
a flood plain, and critics of the Mayor doubt that it will ever be
built.
       Meanwhile, the city appears to be crumbling, vast stretches of
it looking as if they had been bombed. There are blocks and blocks
of burned houses, casualties of fires started by feuding drug
dealers or by kerosene heaters used to cut down on utility bills.
       City workers say the sporadic paychecks and low morale have
crippled city services. For months, the city has ignored the
demands from its creditors.
       The city's largest employer, the public school system, is facing
a $12 million deficit and plans to lay off a third of its 1,000
classroom teachers April 1.
       ``People hoped the problem would go away,'' said Elmo Bush,
superintendent of schools. ``But it can't be denied any longer.''
       Leven said he did not foresee a turnaround any time soon. ``I
don't think there is any way you can make much out of what is there
now,'' he said. ``The best you can do is keep the patient
comfortable.''

          Thank you all for your concerned responses to my observation
on a cultural difference between Japan and the US. I must after
this remain silent because I have two little ones at home (one still in
diapers), a marriage that takes time, and a dissertation to finish.
I would enjoy moving over to info-japan and discussing
many things about my visit to Japan with you.   I have "lots" more
to say about women, for example.  And I suspect you all do too.
And then there are the hot springs, earthquake experiences, eating
attitudes, consumer attitudes, work ethics, etc.

          Please do not be disturbed by my raving.  Long ago when
moving from red neck America, to intellectual white collar America,
I learned to cope with the very things I touched on in my past message.
The Japanese gentleman's entry into my life has only made "things" more
interesting, ... the way I like it.   We all marry into strange tribes.
The differences are just a "tad" more pronounced between mine and my
husband's. 

           You heard from me at a time in which the family is going
through many changes.  The parallel is learning a new technique
in tennis (or strategy in chess).  At first, it seems like you are
losing ground and your performance seems horrible.  But
in the end you become stronger and improved ... able to play the
game better.  I suspect this applies to learning Japanese too.

To those concerned about my son's wrists, thank you for your suggestions.
I am just learning to be an avocate of his learning style within the system
(WOW, there are so many systems!) 
"Slapping wrists" meant verbal negative reenforcement in the U.S.,
and a slap on the thigh in Japan.  In trying to be brief, my
language became sloppy. Sorry.  

We'll try to hang in there with the
Japanese language. We believe that education is the best
gift that parents give to their youngsters, whether
it be sewing, swimming, a foreign language or loving....  What ever
you do well, don't be stingy, pass it on if you can...

        So now I retire to listen to your mail about the Japanese
language.  The thing that most disturbs ME about my last letter
is my admission that my Japanese is still so horrible even though
there are many reasons I should learn it well.  Maybe after
the baby is out of diapers and the dissertation is done ....?

                                  JOAN PECKHAM

Between 7,8,9 we all use the same set of printers.  This is more than
necessary due to frequent breakdowns and people who need to print out
massive dvi files.  True, that the people on 4 are less likely to use
printers up here, but let's face it, they are a small minority within
the ai lab.  Unless some selfless grad student takes the time to play
with the lpr program, messages will still have to go out to all-ai.

Now go away please,
