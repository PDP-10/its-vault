I propose to substitute three courses for the three EECS department
requirements 6.033/6.035, 6.034, and 6.170.  The courses are

  6.892 Computer Systems
    In this graduate course taught by Prof. Gifford, we read
    historic and modern papers in computer science, and in
    addition to discussing the material itself, prepared oral
    and written critiques of the papers.

  6.100 Undergraduate Laboratory
    In this laboratory project, currently in progress, I 
    have participated in the design of, and am currently
    implementing, the Boxer programming language under Prof.
    Abelson and Prof. Andy diSessa, now at U.C. Berkeley.

    My responsibility has been the design and implementation
    of the language itself, and its interpreter, compiler,
    debugger, error system.
  
  6.821 Concepts in Modern Programming Languages
    Graduate core course.
