title: `PELLE THE CONQUEROR''
text: 

        ``Pelle the Conqueror'' was shown as part of the New York Film
Festival this fall. Following are excerpts from Vincent Canby's
review, which appeared in The New York Times on Sept. 30. The film,
in Danish with English subtitles, opens in New York today.
        
       Bille August's ``Pelle the Conqueror'' is not for people who
prefer to take showers. It's for the person who likes to get into a
movie as if it were a long hot bath. To hurry it would be to miss
its method and its point.
       The Danish film, which won the Golden Palm, the top prize, at
this year's Cannes Festival, is a vividly re-created, minutely
detailed panorama of a particular time (the turn of the century),
place (rural Denmark) and circumstance (life on a great farm) in
the course of the four seasons.
       The observer is Pelle (Pelle Hvenegaard), a staunch, wide-eyed
Swedish boy who has come to Denmark with his aging, destitute and
widowed father, Lasse (Max von Sydow).
       Lasse has promised his son that Denmark will be a land of
opportunity, a place of plentiful jobs where pork is served on
Sundays and butter is spread on bread. Instead Lasse and Pelle are
lucky to be hired as little better than indentured servants,
underpaid, underfed and overworked.
       For the illiterate Lasse, who drinks too much and has no spine
to fight, the farm is the end of the line. For Pelle, it is his
introduction to an adult world in which rewards and punishments are
thoroughly scrambled and arbitrary power is exercised by the few.
       August's screenplay is adapted from the first part of Martin
Andersen Nexo's Danish novel in which Pelle, when he grows up, goes
on to become a union leader.
       Von Sydow is something splendid to see as the boozy,
weak-willed, loving Lasse. Though it is a rich performance full of
wit and humor, it is never broad or self-serving.
       It is also the backbone of the movie, which sometimes looks too
big in terms of landscapes, weather and the crowds of people on
screen to have come from the comparatively small though clearly
vital Danish film industry. ``Pelle'' has a kind of Dickensian
appreciation for narrative, being packed with subplots perceived in
the melodramtic terms of an adolescent boy's imagination.
       August never indulges the pathos that is built into the story,
which is to his credit as a disciplined film maker, though it also
keeps the film at a slight remove from the audience. One is never
unaware that this is a very long movie. August brings a cool
20th-century sensibility to what is, at heart, a piece of
passionate 19th-century fiction.
       As played by Hvenegaard, who looks a bit like the young Dickie
Moore in Hollywood's old ``Oliver Twist,'' Pelle is idealized
without being softened. Mostly, he is a camera, receiving the
images of a childhood that will eventually shape the course of his
life.
       The scale of the physical production is most impressive. August
and Jorgen Persson, the cinematographer, avoid the picturesque,
which is not to say that ``Pelle'' isn't a beautiful film. It's
just that its looks are more than skin deep.
