I sent this to unix-haters@mc but I was wrong.

So, here's this fancy new HP machine in PGS's office.  I log in and it
gives me X11 with clocks and emacs's and 47 8x10 color *glossy* windows,
without my even asking for them.

But it also doesn't give me a prompt. Why?  Because the line
 	set prompt="`whoami`@`hostname | sed \"s/\..*//\"`>"
in my init file, which has been there forever, suddenly says
	Unmatched `.

Hmmm.  This is the same error I get with "which," regular readers of
this column may remember.

Anyway, I try to debug that for a while, give up in impatience and
decided to SUPDUP to AI to read my mail.  No SUPDUP.  Just "rsh to
rice-chex" Patrick suggests.  RSH doesn't work.  Somehow or other I
manage to get to rice-chex and run SUPDUP there.

About an hour later, my "console" window closes, the 46 other windows
close, and I get logged out.  Why?  Well, my login file, which got
aborted, didn't manage to get around to the last couple of lines,
which had the

	set autologout 0

in it.  And of course, since I wasn't typing in my login window,
the machine assumed that I wasn't using it.  Who cares about all
those jobs that I'm running anyway.

Fortunately, my EMACS on AI is running, detached, and will be there
when I log back in.  Too bad UNIX's idea of the connection between
terminals and jobs and job trees is exactly the wrong one.  Using a
window system just can't fix that problem.

Well, anyway, in my apoplexy I started complaining about all these
"weenix unies."

I think we should all refer to Unix as Weenix.  It's kind of like
calling TOPS-20 Twenex.  Remember, you heard it here first.

Leigh.
