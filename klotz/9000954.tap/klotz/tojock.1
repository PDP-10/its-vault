Jock,

I got your letter and check today.  Thank you.

I haven't gotten any mail from you since a couple of
days after I sent you the finished Finnish Logo, and
I was in Japan at the time.  I thought I sent you a letter
in response saying that yes, I had spent more than 40 hours on
the Finnish thing, and that I can't remember how much I spent
on floppy disks.

If not, I'll send you one.

Thanks for the check.  It helps.  I'm trying to graduate
in February.  MIT took all the money I made in Japan
and more.  I flew back to San Francisco and drove here
with PGS pulling a u-haul.  I have a drivers license
now, but I hadn't driven more than about six hours when
I started the trip.  I picked up a post card in
North Platte, Nebraska, but that was about the high
point of the trip.  We did it in 68 hours.

I understand fro Alison, who I ran into in Harvard
Square, that you flushed Brian's code and got someone
else to work on the IIgs Logo.  I heard good things
about it.  Please send me a brochure if you have one.


People send me mail a lot asking Mac Logo questions.
I don't have a manual.  Could you send me one?  Currently
I'm having an argument with somebody over whether the
"comments in procedures show up in the help window when
you mouse HELP on them" feature is documented or not.

I don't have your letter at hand, and I can't remember if
you asked anything else.  Oh, I have some things there
that I would like to pick up at some point.  I'm thinking
about building my infrared viewer sometime soon.

How are things?

Leigh.
