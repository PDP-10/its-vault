Dear Leigh,

	I met Kame-san and Hiro-kun last week.
I told them you really appliciated them for ther kindness of this
summer and you are thinkig give them presents.
They said you don't need to think about such things.
Also Kame-san was surprised when he came back home from the US
because his room was so clean and he thanked to you very much.
I think you don't need send them some presents.
Next time when you come to Japan, if you don't mind, please give them
one CD for each of them.  
I think that's enough and your favorite one is okay.

	Also I talked Kame-san about your job for ITI  which you don't
like to do next.
Kame-san said you can select your job in ITI.
If you don't have any choices that's Carl's fault.
ITI is flexible, or negociable, Kame-san said.
If you want to talk to kame-san, please send me a mail.
I will send it to him.
