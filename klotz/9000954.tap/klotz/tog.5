I've been working on my thesis and been sick for a day or two.

I would like to meet the Fuji Xerox people before saying much to them.
I'm planning to be out there in early February.  I think that any
detailed discussion of money matters is a sensitive issue, and I'd
rather not have that be the first topic of discussion, either before
we meet or after.  Right now, I don't even know what the work is, or
who I'd be working with.

But I realize that you may need to know something about my
expectations when talking to them, so I'll tell you what I'm thinking.
I know the numbers I'll be giving you will sound high, but remember
that the dollar is worth roughly half of what it was four years ago.

I'm not writing to ask you to ask them for these amounts; I'm just
telling you that when I do talk about money with them, this is what I
will ask for.  I'm not saying to keep the whole thing a secret, either.
I trust your judgement.

o	Here's what I'm planning to ask for:

Y1M/mo to Y2M/mo, plus an apartment, is what I would need for working
in Japan.  Below Y1,000,000 would not be acceptable.

The apartment could be a dorm room, but not if it is at a considerable
commute distance.  (I.e., far outside Tokyo, like Nerima or Hachioji,
are not OK.)  Simply finding an apartment and paying the brokerage
fees (roughly 6 months rent) might be OK, though.

o	Here's my reasoning:

I have been offered $5K-$6K/mo in Cambridge, without even looking.
Living in Japan is more expensive than the U.S., even if you live
normally.  It is also more strenuous to work in a Japanese company,
even one that is as relaxed as I hope FX is.

If I worked in Japan, I would expect to get paid more than for working
in the U.S., in the range of 50% to 100% more.  Remember that there
are 125 yen to the dollar now, and in 1984 there were 250 yen to the
dollar; one way of looking at it is that they should be able to pay
about twice what American companies pay.

I do know people who've been paid Y2M/mo, plus accomodations, long
term.

I realize that if I were hired directly to work for Fuji Xerox, they
might not be able to pay this amount.  Japanese companies generally
underpay new employees and overpay older employees.  This works out
fine for Japanese people who stay at one company, and who live
frugally when young and then have to provide for kids and stuff
later.  But I have no intention of working for them for the next
40 years, and I doubt that they want that either.

If they like me and want me and will pay what I need, there may still
be problems with the personnel department.  Bureaucracy in Japan is quite
incredible, with the people being sticklers for everything.  It may be
that being hired as a consultant is the only way to go.  Or, maybe
they can put some things in an expense account.

You see why I want to talk to them first.  They might be thinking
something like, well, working in Japan must be worth a salary cut.
But, in my experience, working in Japan and working for Japanese
company is a difficult task requiring constant attention to cultural
details (not to mention language).  I do this well, but I think it is
something to be compensated for.  And from what I can tell from what
you've told me, it looks to me like this job is a good match between
my skills and the company's needs.

If the best offer is something like $60K/yr plus an apartment,
then it's not really something I can do.  I can get essentially
that in the U.S., where the cost of living is much lower.

o	Here are some calculations:

The following I got from an acquaintance who is a professor of
Japanese History at UC Davis.  I added some explanations in []'s,
but they're not very explanatory.
    These figures are yen/month excluding bonuses.  As a rough rule
    of thumb, multiply by 18 for a yearly figure.  The source is
    Minkan kyu^yo no jittai (Jinji'in, 1984).  This is a survey of
    private industry wages used for setting civil service pay
    parity.  You would probably be safe to add 50 percent to those
    figures to bring them up to date and to allow for benefits.

    New university grads: 136,858.
    Factory manager: 486,348.
    Bucho^: 494,864.			[directory/chief of a department/section]
    Kacho^: 494,864.			[chief of a section]
    Kakaricho^: 356,622.		[chief clerk]
    Shunin: 324,439.			[... manager]



Following his directions:

In 1984, a section leader (kacho, bucho) got paid about 500,000 yen
per month, plus about a 50% bonus at the end of the year.  Adjusting
that to 750,000 for additional benefits and for 1989 and adding the
50% bonus gives about Y1,125,000/mo.  At the current rate of Y125=$1,
that gives about $8000/mo.
