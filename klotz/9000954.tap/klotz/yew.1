At the end of my freshman year in 1980 I left MIT to take a position as a
sponsored research staff member at the Logo Group, a part of the
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.  I worked for Prof. Seymour Papert.
After one year the group closed, and I went to work for Terrapin, Inc., a
Cambridge company which began to do work with the Logo -- a programming
language used mainly in education.

After a few years with Terrapin I returned to MIT to work for the
newly-formed Educational Computing Group, a part of the Lab for Computer
Science co-headed by Prof. Harold Abelson and Andrea diSessa.  After one
year at the ECG, I returned to MIT in 1984 for two years as an
undergraduate.  I supported myself and paid my tuition out of my savings
from my work at Terrapin, at MIT, and incoming royalty money from
Commodore 64 Logo, a product I developed at Terrapin.  

During those two years and the next year I worked on a project for
Terrapin on a royalty basis on a project which has to date netted me no
more than the $10,000 advance for three years of work.

One year ago, I discovered that Terrapin had defrauded me of approximately
$12,500 in royalties for Commodore 64 Logo dating back to 1985.  I have to
date spent $4500 in legal fees and recoverd $7500, for a total of $3000.
I expect to have about $500 more in legal fees to recover the remaining
amount, which I estimate at now about $7500, for an additional $7000.

Unfortunately, Terrapin is now in financial trouble and I may never get
the $7000.  They are well behind in payments, and have recently been
forced to vacate their Cambridge offices and move to Malden.

. From Terrapin, I can be sure only of the aggregate $3,000 I have received
this year.

This June and July I worked for Prof. diSessa, now at U.C. Berkeley, and
received $5,060 total compensation.  About $1,440 was for travel and
living expenses, and the remaining $3,620 the consulting fee.  In reality,
I spent $1000 for rent, $450 for transportation to and from California,
and about $600 on meals, for total expenses (excluding tax) of $2,050,
leaving me about $3,010.

At the end of July I went to Japan as part of a program co-sponsored by
the MIT Japan Science and Technology program, Prof. Heisuke Hironaka of
Harvard, and various groups in Japan.  I have studied Japanese for several
years but haven't been there since I started.  During my six weeks in
Japan I attended three weeks of academic conferences, learned more
Japanese, and found a company I might work for next summer.  I spent
approximately $1100 of my savings.  I consider the month and a half to be
part of my education in the most real sense.  I therefore ask that you
consider the $1100 spent to be part of my educational expenses, rather
than vacation.

. My summer earnings, taking into account the $1100 I spent learning
Japanese, come to $1910.

Second semester last academic year (1986-87), I returned to MIT full time
and paid my own tuition and room&board.  The $3,000 I received from
Terrapin in 1987 has gone to pay for that semester.  

Here is a more concise accounting:
At the end of July before I went to Japan and before I received the $5,060
from Berkeley, I had $192.60 in savings.  Since then I have received
$5,000 from Terrapin and received legal bills of $3,300, for a balance of
$1700.  I have as yet paid no taxes on this money.

Because of an investment I made in 1980, I receive approximately $13,000
in "phantom income" in the 1986, 1987, and 1988.  The money is profit on
my investment, but I do not receive the money; I do however, pay taxes on
it.  In 1989 I hope to receive approximately $24,000 from the
investment, but it is possible that I will not receive anything.  The
effect of this phantom income is to raise both my tax bracket and my tax
liability.  If I receive the additional $7,500 from Terrapin I will owe
approximately $3,000 in taxes.  If I receive no additional money from
Terrapin, I will owe more.

I currently have about $3,000 in savings.

My rent is $500/month.
