Dear Leeeeigh!!

Hi! How are you?

We are now a little bit tired because of the extra work of translation
and several social events.
But, you need not care about it because we are going to recover now.

Last week end, we were in Kyoto. Naomi's brother has married and had a ceremony.
All my family are fine.

From the end of summer seminar, I had been very busy. I got several letters
discussing about the Peer Group of Yugen Club from Shiota-san
about our future plan. We took some reaction for the letter and made a news
letter for the members of the group.

It is a plan to make another seminar for elementaly school or junior high 
school students. Now it is just a rough plan, but the out line of the story
is as follows.

It is widly said that Japanese technology lacks originality. Recently, I 
read Feynman's book and I thought we need a educational system to tell
the young people what the real mind of scientist is. As for myself, 
I have never had such a education. I learned the way to do something or
some knowledge through school education which do not help anything to be real
scientist. 
I want to tell the young people how important to think by them selves.

I am going to write about that in a few weeks.

We have another story. We had an interview from a writer.
And I found your name in his book. It has already translated into Japanese.
The detail story will be witten by Noyuri from now on.(Yoshiaki)

<From Noyuri>
We met Grant Fjermedal who is the author of "Tomorrow Makers," through
Yoshiaki's friend who works for Apple Japan.
Grant is collecting information for next book about Macintosh users in the world.
He is travelling all over the world now and the book will appear two years later.
When he wrote Tomorrow Makers Apple asked him to write about Macintosh users in the world.
So now he got money from Apple US and cooperation from other countries' apple like Apple Japan.
We were interviewed as Japanese Macintosh users.  He will write about Japanese users from only four subjects including us.
Yoshiaki found your name with Hal in Tomorrow Makers.
Isn't it amazing you are in the previous book and we will be in the next book?

We will write you soon.  Take care.

					Best regards,  Yoshiaki & Noyuri.

Dear Leigh,

	I met Kame-san and Hiro-kun last week.
I told them you really appliciated them for ther kindness of this
summer and you are thinkig give them presents.
They said you don't need to think about such things.
Also Kame-san was surprised when he came back home from the US
because his room was so clean and he thanked to you very much.
I think you don't need send them some presents.
Next time when you come to Japan, if you don't mind, please give them
one CD for each of them.  
I think that's enough and your favorite one is okay.

	Also I talked Kame-san about your job for ITI  which you don't
like to do next.
Kame-san said you can select your job in ITI.
If you don't have any choices that's Carl's fault.
ITI is flexible, or negociable, Kame-san said.
If you want to talk to kame-san, please send me a mail.
I will send it to him.
