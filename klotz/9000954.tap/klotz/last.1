I saw "The Last Emperor" last night.  (I'm not going to say anything
very specific here about the plot, but if you don't want to hear what I think
about the thematic elements before you see the movie, you might not want
to read this.)

Not surprisingly, it is mr. fatalistic movie.  But they tried to make it
end on a positive sort of "people be human" note.  It's a long movie --
over two hours.  It reminded me a lot of "Fanny and Alexander" in that
there is a tragic falling off from a first world of undivided luxury.  In
Fanue, der Biskop appears roughly halfway through the movie and dominates
the rest of the film.  The chronology is linear, but there are some
fantasy or dream scenes interjected to solve dramatic problems.  In this
movie, the past is shown in flashback identified with memories or reveries
of the main character, but there is no sense of either the past or the
present dominating the film until very near the end.  As a result, the
shock that happens in Fanny and Alexander happens repeatedly here.  There
is also one scene of questionable reality which solves a dramatic dilemma
and restates a strong theme.  I suppose if you mixed tones from the Tale
of Genji and Fanue, you'd get something like this movie.

A movie about the last emperor of China that purports to focus on his life
can hardly help be one that emphasizes the human aspects of people
(powerful or otherwise) caught up in something so huge as to be beyond
their understanding.

The emperor is protrayed very sympathetically.  Early in the film when he
is a child, other people are strongly archetypical, and not very human.
The court ladies really look like ghastly statues when we first see them.
Even by the time of his marriage ceremony, there is a feeling of alienness
that transcends the mere excotcism of the presumably ancient Chinese
rituals and customs.  But eventually, people in the court are shown as
people; not necessarily good people, but as more than good&evil.  This
kind of introduction, where characters first appear as extra-humanly good
or bad, and then change into people with understandable emotions and
motives, happens again and again.  I think it's part of a statement about
interpretations of history.  The director wants us to think about people
like this emperor in terms of their their plight, as opposed to in terms
of their place in history.

On a different level, I found the film disturbing because of what happens to
women, and of what happens to him and women.  For example, there are three
overtly sexual scenes, and all of them are purposefully disturbing in one
way or another.  They are all quite sensual and strongly affecting.  Even
here, come to think of it, the question of person as role-fulfiller vs.
person as human comes into play.  There was one of them that made me
squirm, I must tell you.  And it was also the most disturbing one.

Now, here's what Ellen Draper would have liked me to say:

When the emperor and empress arrive in Manchu-kuo, they stand around on a
hillock in the deserted landscape for some sort of ceremony.  A
sexually-oriented indiscretion occurs, and the camera cuts quickly to a
Westerner behind a chain-link fence who is pulling down his camera, having
just taken a picture of the indiscretion.

That night, at Manchu-kuo's first state function, as we see the empress,
beautiful but tottering, the movie cameras photographing the event see her
too, and she gives them a disgusted look.  Later that evening she goes to
the emperor and tells him, "Mr. Amakusa is the most important man in
Manchu-kuo; you are blind."

Thus, the most important man in the film is Mr. Amakusa, who is roughly
the same age as, and about as handsome as the emperor when he is in Western
dress.

Mr. Amakusa is the director of the Japanese film bureau in Manchu-kuo.

He's played by the young Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto, who (along
with Dabid Byrne) did the music.

Well, anyway, go see this movie so I can talk to you about it.
