Carl,

I'm sorry I didn't answer your messages sooner.  I've found it
difficult to decide what to do, and found it difficult to talk to you
about my decision.

When we last talked about the work, I said that I was concerned
because I wasn't very interested in the work itself.  Since
then, it's become clearer to me that I would not be happy working for
a year on writing a set of graphical financial analysis tools.  I
don't think I would enjoy the work, and wouldn't be able to invest
myself in the project to the degree you want.

Also, I have obligations to Andy diSessa at Berkeley to spend two
months full-time (or equivalent) over the next year working on Boxer.
It looks like it may be best to work in Berkeley in February and
possibly March, although the time is somewhat flexible.

Given these constraints, I don't think I could be your "third man."

However, I am still interested in working with you and Charles, either
some time in the future on a different project or on a part of this
project that makes better use of my particular skills.  I would be
interested in helping you conduct interviews or needs assessment,
either in February (pushing my Berkeley commitments a few months), or
afterwards.  However, I realize that you will need someone full-time
for this project from ASAP until March, and that's not something I'm
able to do.

I'd hoped to get more done during the school year, but it hasn't
worked out that way.  It's made it difficult for me to make decisions
about what I want to do after I graduate.  I'm sorry I was unable to
figure this out earlier and let you know.

Here are the high points: I don't think I could hack window system
programming for more than three months, because I don't like doing
graphics and am ambivalent about financial analysis.  I have to work
at Berkeley for two months, since I've already been paid for it.  I'd
be happy to work helping you with interviews, reading documents, and
design, but I understand that you will probably want a full-time
person to add to a team.  I can't do anything at all until February,
but if you need help in one of those areas then, please let me know.

Once again, I'm sorry if my not answering you has put you into a fix.
I should have called you earlier.

I hope all is going well with you.  Please give my regards to Mr.
Kameyama and friends.

Leigh.
