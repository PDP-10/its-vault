There are no macros for TeXing box structure.  Those somehow got lost with the
demise of X.  The LaTeX stuff has been rewritten by a summer student so you
can use that.  FTP the files latex.lisp and auto-fill.lisp from the
boxer source directory.  If you need printout, I can do it for you from
here or maybe there are some athenaoids (custer ?) you can presume upon
for the use of LN03's.

oops, I meant to say that the box drawing macros were lost with the demise
of OZ not X.  If there are backup tapes lying around (and convenient) you
might try looking in my old OZ directory
