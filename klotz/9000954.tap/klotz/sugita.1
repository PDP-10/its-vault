\noindent Dear Takako,

Thank you so much for your letter and the pictures.  I'm sorry it took me
so long to reply.  This semester was very hard.

Today it snowed a lot, and it's very cold --- 3F, and windy 18-40 MPH.
This is really a snowstorm; it's not usually like this.

I enjoyed meeting and talking to you in Prof. Hironaka's seminar.  I liked
the trip to Jigokudani, too.  It smelled so bad there that I couldn't believe
it when we had lunch overlooking the hot springs.  Do you remember how all
the potato chip bags had gotten really big?  I didn't understand the
lectures, either.  Many times I took a nap.  I hope nobody noticed.

At the campfire, I was surprised when they asked me to be the narrator for
the {\em tenka}.  It was hard to read the words I was supposed to say
because they were in Japanese, but then it was dark outside too!

Do you have entrance exams in February, or is that next year?  If it's
this year, then good luck!  I'm going to go to Berkeley, California for
one semester of school and work.  Berkeley is in northern California, near
San Francisco.  It's 65F there all year.  I'm looking forward to going
soon.  I worked for the university there last summer, and I'm going to do
some work and some classes from January until May.

This summer I might go to Japan again.  I don't know yet.  If I do go,
I'll let you know.

Good luck, and you take care too.
