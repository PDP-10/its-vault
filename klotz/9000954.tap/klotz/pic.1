Leigh, the background is that Andy wants a procedure (called move) that
transfers the bindings of one box into another box and he can't because 
we aren't looking up variables inside of virtual copies

		you need port flavored input to move or else the "to" variable

	Yes, but I don't care if it is a copy.  The MUTATED copy gets passed
	on to the next recursion of move, Right?  The thing that gets returned
	is a mutated copy of a mutate copy of ..., and that's what I intended.
	I know the bug you mean (I think) and I don't think this is an
	instance of it.  I am not intending to mutate the thing that supplied
	input, only the input that I get before I pass it on for more mutation.

ok, I see.  The problem is that binding information inside of
virtual copies is not implemented because we couldn;t figure out
a good way to do it without slowing other things down.  Perhaps the
lisp error is something Leigh put in.  We sent mail about another aspect 
of this problem last week.  The bug was that named subprocedures inside
a shape were not available.  I think the easiest work around is to
mutate the original (it is likely to be much faster than the variable
lookup inside of virtual copy).  The initial implementation (not curently
installed apparently) for looking up variables inside of VC's loops
through the items of each row of the VC looking for named boxes.

Too bad it's not documented! A great feature.
