title: FRENCH SELL `TRADITIONAL' WEDDINGS TO JAPANESE TOURISTS

       PARIS -- At least twice a week, in the chapel of his 280-year-old
family chateau, the Marquis de Breteuil earns a little pocket money
by making another Japanese couple's dream come true.
       In a solemn but absolutely unofficial ceremony, the Marquis
slowly reads the French civil marriage vows to starry-eyed Japanese
tourists, uniting them in French style, if not French law.
       The all-in-one price includes simultaneous translation into
Japanese, a champagne toast, a parchment certificate embossed with
the Breteuil family coat of arms, and the services of the Marquis
Henri Francois himself. When the marquis is absent, his cousin the
baron does the honors.
       ``It's very special for them to have a ceremony in the historic
French tradition,'' says Breteuil, who selectively offers his
two-hour chateau and marriage package only to Japanese. ``And for
us, it contributes to the upkeep.''
       After a year of buying French vineyards, chateaux, restaurants
and Impressionist paintings, record numbers of Japanese are now
making France one of their top tourist destinations.
       The normally haughty French, meanwhile, have dropped any
pretense of indifference. Like the resourceful Marquis de Breteuil,
they are learning to package and sell anything evoking French
culture to the free-spending Japanese.
       Cognac producers and boutique owners are sending their employees
off to learn Japanese. Expensive Paris restaurants like the Tour
d'Argent prepare set menus with everything from appetizer to desert
chocolates pre-selected and written in Japanese.
       The Cordon Bleu and Ritz-Escoffier cooking schools offer
half-day gourmet cooking demonstrations to visiting tour groups,
complete with a Japanese translator. The jet-setters' beauty salon,
Carita, welcomes Japanese tour groups for half-day makeup sessions.
       Miki Travel Agency in Paris even contacted the Hotel Ritz,
suggesting a tour group stop at the exclusive Ritz exercise club.
The hotel discouraged the idea. ``We prefer to deal with clients on
an individual basis,'' said assistant director Helmut Profunser.
       Meanwhile, nearly every weekend at the Nikko Hotel, Japanese
women wait for the man who symbolizes the essence of French
elegance and charm. When movie star Alain Delon appears, they utter
their newly learned French.
       ``Je t'aime,'' they whisper. `I love you.' ``
       ``Moi, aussi,'' the actor responds, handing out samples of his
new line of toiletries. ``Me, too.''
       Delon has a contract to appear at 35 hotel dinner parties for
visiting Japanese. Hironobu Taninaka, general manager of Miki
Travel, said the arrangement is good for both sides. It gives
tourists a chance to meet their idol and gives Delon a chance to
pitch his products.
       An estimated 650,000 to 700,000 Japanese will have visited
France in 1988, 20 percent more than last year. Only about
one-fourth are business travelers, a change from earlier years, and
most ignore the landmarks and museums to head for the stores.
       ``They come to Paris now just for shopping,'' says Mikio Aoki,
director of the Japan Travel Bureau office in Paris. ``It used to
be that the Paris portion of the trip was four days. Now they say
there is nothing to see. They just want to buy.''
       Their purchasing power leaves French merchants awestruck.
       At Cartier jewelers, the hottest-selling item is the classic
three-gold ring. Price: $1,100. At Chanel, young couples wait
patiently to stock up on quilted leather purses. At Hermes,
Japanese women are three deep to buy signed silk scarves.
       At Louis Vuitton, Japanese tourists line up outside to get into
the store to buy armloads of luggage, briefcases and, in
particular, a bucket-shaped purse that costs $450. All must have
the trademark ``LV'' printed on the leather.
       ``They are not interested in our lines that don't have the
monogram,'' said Florence Cardon, who manages one of the Paris
Vuitton shops. ``But they are easy customers. They don't hesitate.
They know exactly what they want before they come in. And what's
more, everybody who comes in with them buys exactly the same
items.''
       Some items are popular for mysterious reasons. Fauchon, the
gourmet food purveyor, has seen sales of its apple tea quadruple in
four years without any special promotion or advertising.
       ``I'd say that 95 percent of it is bought by Japanese
tourists,'' said Jean-Claude Crochard, the store manager. ``We
really don't know why. We just know that they love it, they come
here just to find it, and they have to buy it.''
