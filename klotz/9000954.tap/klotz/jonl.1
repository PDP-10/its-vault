Subject: compiler-let

A succinct, well-illustrated, easy-to-read and *useful* example would 
go a long way to dousing some flames on this topic.  Could you do it?

Glenn has offered a different solution -- something that could be
implemented as a new special form, and that would be helped by
SYNTACTIC-ENVIRONMENT-ACCESS.   But a solution isn't nearly so
impressive at this point as a good illustration that the case is
well founded.
