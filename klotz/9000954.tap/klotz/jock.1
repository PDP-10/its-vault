[JOCK -- PLEASE COUNT THIS AS 15 MINUTES BUG TIME. -- LEIGH]

Hello. I intend to go there tomorrow.

The only reason for STAMPTEXT to complain about not liking 12 would be if
the guy changed the font size to be something bigger.  Like maybe he has
made the default font be something else using the Configuration program.
The width and height can't be too small or else the Mac internal character
printing routine will crash.  In order to avoid that lossage, STAMPTEXT
refuses to stamp into an area that's too small.  Since it doesn't crash
for you, and he hasn't modified the program, he must have changed the font
size, either with Configure or automatically (because he's in Switzerland)
as part of the International Utilities package.

  He was also pissed because he insists that nowhere in the documentation
  does it state that the files contained in the Logo System folder have to
  be kept in that folder, even under HFS (I did mention that in the update
  letter I sent out to people, but he's right that it is not stated anywhere
  in the documentation.
I can hardly say anything about this.  When the manual was published there
was no HFS compatibility.  I went through the version you have and put in
notes about all the things that needed to be documented.  I'm sure that's
one of them.  Also "even under HFS" is a misconception -- it's "only under
HFS."  If he REALLY wants to, he can use the Apple Resource Editor
(RESEDIT) to change the string resource in Logo that says "Logo Folder" to
say "Faulde du Logeau" or whatever he wants in whatever langue or lingue
he speaks.  

See, I thought of everything.  It's just not an option in Configure
because it's supposed to be for translations.

See you soon,
Leigh.

Hi Leigh.

Sorry, but it's another Logo for Mac question.

This guy in Switzerland says the Logo Demo is buggy for the following
reason:

When it prints...

	The shape of any turtle can be changed.  Here, turtles
	are given the shape of letter tiles.

Logo crashes and says...

	STAMPTEXT didn't like 12 as input.
	It expected a number greater than or equal to 14 at level 3 in line
	(STAMPTEXT FIRST :STRING 12 12 0) of TILESHAPE

That line is indeed there, but why STMPTEXT should complain is beyond me.
Anyway, we had the demo running for hours at the ECCO conference just a
few days ago and it never crashed.

He was also pissed because he insists that nowhere in the documentation
does it state that the files contained in the Logo System folder have to
be kept in that folder, even under HFS (I did mention that in the update
letter I sent out to people, but he's right that it is not stated anywhere
in the documentation.

Any ideas?

Thanks, Alison.

P.S. It looks like we'll never come out with an IBM Logo at this rate.
Brian's not going to do it, I know.  I'm not even sure that he will ever
finish Logo PLUS (the ProDOS version.  This is the second time he's said
it would take a few weeks and it's now been a few months!  Any guesses
about why it's taking him so long (except for the obvious, which is that
this place is depressing).  Sigh.
