The only non-stop flights from Boston to San Fran left at 8:15 am or 6
pm.  The return was booked since the cost of this round-trip ticket,
if issued today, is $440.50 (25% penalty for changes). A one-way
ticket would be $473 or $568. The ticket needs to be issued today, so
I hope you can send me an e-mail answer today to say this is ok or
not. We can send the ticket to you Federal Express, so let me know the
best mailing address (not a box number). Also advise your airline seat
preference...smoking or non-smoking, aisle or window..and if you
belong to United's mileage program.  carol@dewey.soe.berkeley.edu

Subject: travel tickets -- oops, I almost forgot

Leigh Klotz (cc'd on this note) is coming to work for us for us from
2-14 through 5-1.  Business was working on travel advance, but I have
not heard from Jacqui or Teras, and don't know what's up.  You might
check, but in any case we should look into getting reasonably costing
tickets for these dates, from Boston on the 14 of 2, returning to
Boston on the 1 of 5.  If we can still get cheapie cheapie tickets for
this time, I think we should go ahead and do that.  If not, would be
good to know the options.  You can go ahead and charge my account if
we need to process tickets today.

My guess is schedule doesn't matter much, leave Bos. around mid-day
should be fine.  Leave here to get back to Bos. at a reasonable
hour, so probably morning.  I bet Leigh would sacrifice going to SF so
that he could get a non-stop.
