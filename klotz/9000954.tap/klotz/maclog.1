Subject: Mac Logo

I had tried to get help on procedures, and did find it useful that
one is told what inputs are required. But I would never have guessed
that comments would appear in the help window.

This feature seems to be one advantage Terrapin Logo has over Object
Logo. Another is that it's a lot easier to get a handle on. The fact
that it is less powerful one can live with, especially in pre-college
education.  The ability to work with fractions, complex numbers,
arbitrary accuracy in integer calculations are all really cool of
course. But the biggest shortcoming of the Terrapin Logo over Object
Logo in everyday use is in superficial friendly features they provide
that you didn't. Specifically: better Mac interface; better scrolling
control; when you close edit windows you're asked whether you want to
save; zoom boxes; graphics don't get erased if covered up; there is a
prompt in the Listener (Logo) window; bold characters to distinguish
what you type from what Logo types; it's possible to execute only
part of an edit window; and so on.

The reason I'm listing all this is in the (foolish?) hope you might
spruce up the Terrapin Logo some day.

By the way, I may never have told you, but Commodore Logo was one of
the great discoveries of my life. I have had such a great time with
it -- fooling around myself, teaching Logo to kids of various ages,
programming large tools and games... and now the fun continues on the
Mac. Thanks for making all that possible for those of us not in the
Apple 2 universe!!!

On another subject:
Am I right that THROW and CATCH are in poor taste style-wise? Or are
there things they are necessary for?
