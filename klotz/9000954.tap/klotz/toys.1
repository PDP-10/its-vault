title: POST OFFICES TO PROVIDE FOREIGN MAIL ORDER CATALOGS
text: 

       TOKYO -- Ten mail order companies from the United States, Canada,
Britain and France will soon get an unusual sales partner in Japan
-- the country's postal service.
       In an effort to help consumers take advantage of the strong yen
through what the Japanese call ``personal importing,'' 24 post
offices in nine major cities will set aside an area where people
can look through the catalogs. Order forms prepared by the Ministry
of Posts and Telecommunications will also be provided.
       The idea for personal importing is rooted in Japan's complex
distribution system, which has prevented consumers from seeing
lower prices for imported goods that should have resulted from the
yen's steep appreciation.
       Several organizations have been formed to help consumers bypass
trading companies and other middlemen and import goods directly
from mail order houses and other foreign companies.
       The postal ministry said it decided to provide the unusual
service to help consumers who live in cities that do not have such
personal importing agencies.
       The companies whose cataloges will be made available at the post
offices are Cherry Tree Toys Inc., E&B Marine Inc., Edmund
Scientific Co., S.T. Preston & Son Inc. and Short Sizes Inc. of the
United States; Kay & Co., MCA Far East Exports Co., and Stockwell
China Bazaar of Britain; Les Vins Guy Jeunemaitre of France and
Adanac Trading Co. and Winnipeg Fur Exchange of Canada.
       According to the Manufactured Imports Promotion Organization
(MIPRO), a semi-governmental group that promotes imports of
finished goods, the prices of goods imported by individual Japanese
consumers tend to be 20 percent to 30 percent cheaper than the same
goods sold on the Japanese market.
       MIPRO opened a consultation office for personal importers in
October 1986. The organization said there are now at least 11 such
agencies in Japan.
       Some, like the Lupic Co., operate on a membership base.
Membership in Lupic has grown from 1,000 in August 1987, six months
after it was established, to 6,200 in May.
       Seibu Department Store began providing a consultation service
for personal importers at two of its stores in March 1987. The
number of people using the service has since grown from about 100 a
month to between 500 and 700, a company spokesman said.
