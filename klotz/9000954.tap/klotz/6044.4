   Not to be a real spoilsport or anything, but end of term regulations
   require the assignments in a class without a final to be "one of" a 
   quiz, problem set, oral assignment. As well, the quiz is supposed to 
   be in class. I happened to notice this since I had a serious conflict
   with a humanities class I would normally punt, but can't this time.
   Lord knows I could use a decent quiz score, but the combination of a 
   quiz and a problem set are becoming a real hassle.

   On another note, is there any consensus on the grading for this class?
   At first quizzes and problem sets were to count equally. Then Mike Ernst
   mentioned something about two-thirds one-thirds weighted in favor of the 
   quizzes. And are we going to be measured against the mean or the median?
   Prof. Meyer made a big point about the median being the real measure.

   Whatever, I'd just like to see some of this stuff resolved before the last
   minute.

----------
mea culpa: I just looked up rules and reg's and confirmed Brian's summary.
This is the first time I can remember running an undergrad course w/o a
final, and I wasn't familiar with the detailed reg's.

So let's get back in line as follows:

1.  Problem set 5 as of now is review only.  Don't turn it in; it won't be
graded.

2.  We'll have Wednesday's quiz in class, and that will be the end of the
course.  This means no summary lecture Wednesday.

3.  I will reschedule the missed Wednesday lecture during IAP for those
interested.

Finally, quiz's will be about 2/3 and Problem sets 1/3 of the grade, but my
grade system is not strictly linear: OUTSTANDING performance on quiz OR
problem sets will be given extra weight.
