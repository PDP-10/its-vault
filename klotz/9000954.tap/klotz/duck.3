Leigh,

I don't have a very fine-grained recollection of the various debates
that went on over BUILD syntax. I think that the eventual decision
(like a number of others) was strongly influenced by the fact that a
particular version of BUILD (and a reasonably internally consistent
one) was actually implemented. My feeling about the final version of
the syntax was that it was versatile and powerful, but at the time I
first wrote the code it I had no inkling of the kinds of nested-marker
problems (e.g., !@! and so forth) that would occur with this
quasiquote-like syntax. I don't know how much of the original syntax,
with both its power and hair, has survived.

As for credits: it is fair to say that I had a large hand in the
original implementation of BUILD and GLUE, but the basic ideas and
desiderata were generated by Andy. I think the fairest appropriation
of credits would be (in this order) to Andy, me, and Ed.

Hang in there and keep thesis-ing,

Mike

Hmm. I recall asking for (and implementing) entry and exit triggers
for boxes, but that was really minor. On the other hand, if you
discuss any Boxer offshoots, I'd appreciate a mention of Bochser, the
Scheme-system-with-Boxer-editor that I made for my master's thesis.

Subject: Boxer

I will try to get things arranged for Feb and March; future: to be
discussed.

Give me a day to find time to think a bit about Boxer issues; I'm
swamped with administrivia.

Will express mail papers.  Unfortunately, there is a selection issue
in that we never wrote all the principles in one place, wrote mostly
about the ones that were easiest to talk about.  Some pretty biggies
(not all of which got written up) are:

static spatial hierarchy and scoping issues, use of boxes for environments

copy and execute model

BUILD vs ordinary constructors

flavored inputs (described in a paper called data construction and
reference in Boxer, I'll send)

no atoms (do we want to admit to a public discussion on this)

the basic data/procedure distinction as a box-type rather than syntax,
etc.

no dots and quotes!

definitions don't execute! (as opposed to labels in the library mean
definition)

I remember talking about this way to gewt lexical scoping long ago,
maybe even with you, certyainly with Andy.  But, sure, go ahead and
attribute it to every one you can -- the more people you attribute an
idea to, the more true it is, right?
