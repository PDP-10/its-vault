   I want to install webster on the 4th floor HP machines.
   I can't find the source.

   Does anyone know where the source is, and whether it will
   work on those machines?  Will there be some chaos lossage?

Try /src/local/mit/webster on the suns. This is a tcp/ip version so if
you link in the appropriate library on the hp's (that has support for
the 4.2BSD socket library) things should just work.  

I dont know what you mean by chaos lossage?!
