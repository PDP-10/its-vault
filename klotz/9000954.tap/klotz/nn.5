Dear Leigh,

I got two messages from you just after I sent you small message.
That's because of the worldwide virus maybe you know.
When I received and sent messages between Prof. Sayeki sometimes it takes one week or more and the mail system of Univ. of Tokyo had been down for two weeks in the last month.

I am really sad you are so mad at me and wrote me a second message
in bad words without asking me my situation.
I was working for translation work so hard as a part time job for two monthes.
I was so busy that I could sleep ony a few hours a day those two monthes.
I got a letter from Marlene about a month ago but I have not answered her yet neiher.
Even Marlene I didn't answer to her.
I didn't write to Steve but Yoshiaki did by using my account
because he got VCR tape from Steve.
You can ask Steve that there is Yoshiaki's name in the end of the mail.


I don't want say any excuse anymore.
But I hope you understand me.


					Love, Noyuri.

Dear Leigh,

	I am sorry for not replying to your mail for a long time.
I got your mail in Japanese without any problems.
I sent Christmas presents for you and Aoki-san (Cafe Sushi) today.
I want to send one for Debbie.
Could you give me her address?  Thank you.
I will write you soon again.

					Love, Noyuri.

Dear Leigh,

	I won a second prize of the Logo Prize.
The award is 100,000 yen.
So now I can buy a printer for NEC-PC.

	I am a little bit sad because Yoshiaki and I 
had a plan to visit you when I won the first prize.
