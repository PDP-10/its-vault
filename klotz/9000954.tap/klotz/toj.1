title: HIGH-POWER LAMPS FIND USE AS HEATING DEVICES
author:  PHILIP E. ROSS
text: 

       In 1980, Vortek Industries of Vancouver, British Columbia,
developed the world's brightest light, an arc lamp that used 100
kilowatts of electricity and could illuminate 40 acres, or 10
football fields.
       But no one wanted to light such a large space using so much
electricity, so the lamp became a technological innovation waiting
for a use.
       Nearly a decade later, the lamps are finding uses as heat
sources in a variety of manufacturing processes, ranging from
semiconductors to agricultural implements. The intense beams of
light, which also include much heat, are trained on specific
surfaces that must be heated uniformly and quickly.
       Vortek's largest lamp consumes 300 kilowatts of electricity and
produces 120 kilowatts of optical power. But the company is working
on a one-megawatt lamp, a monster so bright it could illuminate 170
acres and generate so much heat that it could melt a compact car in
minutes. The temperature of the arc itself would reach 14,000
degrees Celsius, more than twice the temperature believed to be at
the surface of the sun.
       ``There will be no way to view this lamp while it's working,''
said David Camm, a Vortek scientist working on development of the
lamp. The company envisions the lamp being used for heat-treating
of large surfaces, like an entire wing of the proposed aerospace
plane.
       The company, which says it is the only concern manufacturing
such high-powered lamps, had its beginnings in a research program
conducted by Gary Albach and several colleagues at the University
of British Columbia. The lamp was originally intended for outdoor
lighting.
       ``When it became commercially available in 1980, it was too
expensive for that purpose, though now a company is interested in
it,'' Albach said.
       But in the early 1980s, the lamp was a solution in search of a
problem. It was used once to melt highway ice, and Hollywood
studios occasionally rented it for special effects.
       ``Then we turned to industrial applications that needed a
powerful source of radiant energy -- solar simulation, heat testing
for aerospace materials and heat treatment of crystalline
substances,'' Albach said.
       In a system developed by the Eaton Corp., the lamps briefly heat
silicon wafers on which hundreds of integrated circuits have been
etched. This heating and subsequent cooling jostles and realigns
the atoms, knitting together any imperfections in the silicon's
crystalline structure.
       The more traditional process used hot gases in ovens to bake the
silicon wafers, a slower, less even form of heating that can
introduce impurities. ``This is much cleaner and more highly
controlled, and you get higher quality and a higher yield,'' Albach
said.
       He said it is used by the International Business Machines Corp.,
Motorola Inc., N.P.T. of Japan, Hyundai, Siemens and N.V. Philips.
       Metalworking is probably the lamp's biggest growth industry. The
precisely metered energy that the lamps can produce is being used
to case-harden the cutting edges of agricultural implements, like
plowshares, that require special hardening.
       Norm Arrison, a scientist working for L.S. Techamer Ltd., a
metallurgical research company based in Calgary, Alberta, said his
company had just bought a Vortek lamp to heat-harden metal surfaces.
       ``It can be used to heat-treat just a part of a product, and
it's a heck of a lot cheaper to purchase and more efficient to
operate than a laser,'' he said.
       ``We are using it to harden cultivator sweeps, which turn over
the soil and plow under plants. You need strength and ductility so
when you hit rocks, you don't break it; but the edge has to be hard
so that you get good wear, especially in sandy soil.''
       Arrison said the Vortek lamp could lay down hardened surfaces so
precisely shaped that they were self-sharpening. Preliminary
studies indicated that this might save 20 to 40 percent of the fuel
now used by tractors that pull the sweeps, he said.
       Hardening in the past had been done with radio-frequency
devices, which induce a current in the surface of metals. But the
hardening is difficult to control precisely. Lasers, on the other
hand, are effective and controllable, but much more expensive to
buy and to operate than the Vortek lamp.
       

       Current aerospace applications for the Vortek lamp exploit its
ability to heat several square inches of a material to enormous
temperatures at low cost.
       ``We're in the second supersonic era, the hypersonic, and you
have to test different compounds for nose cones and leading edges
of wings,'' said Sanford Lustig, head of the Structures Test Branch
at the Flight Dynamics Laboratory of the Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base in Ohio. ``One of the reasons we got it was to simulate laser
energy in a cheap, sensitive process.''
       Arc lamps use charged clouds of gas rather than metal filaments
to conduct electricity and thereby generate light. They can achieve
much higher power because they continue to conduct electricity at
temperatures far higher than any metal can withstand.
       But their brilliance is limited by the temperatures their
casings can withstand. At such high temperatures, the tubes tend to
melt if uncooled, and to crack if cooled externally.
       Vortek's method was to cool the arc lamp from within the tube
with a swirling wall of water.
       Water is injected into the lamp's seven-inch-long quartz tube on
a tangent, forcing it to trace a helical path that protects the
tube. Nested inside is a thinner spiral of argon ions, called a
plasma. The rifle-like twisting of the gas forms a constraining
force that holds the arc so steady it cannot flicker. Little argon
is consumed, so hardly any energy goes to waste as the gas
recirculates.
       The lamp can be precisely and instantaneously controlled. Its
quartz tube has a longer life because the water rinses away debris
from the lamp's tungsten electrodes, which otherwise would sputter
the tube to opacity.
       The standard 100-kilowatt lamp operates hundreds of hours before
needing service. The 300-kilowatt model lasts only three to four
hours, although it is rarely run for more than a few minutes at a
time.
       ``There are mechanical limits to our design that have to do with
the bursting of seals as the water pressure rises, but you could
have a lamp above a megawatt, if there were an application for
it,'' Albach said.
       Vortek is now improving its lamp by reducing its complexity,
said David Camm, one of the company's scientists.
       ``Previous systems used a gas compressor to recirculate the gas,
but we have found a way to reduce the pressure needed so that we
can use waste momentum from the water to provide the small pressure
we need,'' he said. This should reduce the price of the
100-kilowatt model to about half of the current $175,000, he said.
       Increasing the power to 1,000 kilowatts, or one megawatt, is
more complicated. ``We will increase the length of the arc and
increase the power density on the electrodes to 80 kilowatts per
square centimeter from the current level of 50 kilowatts,'' Camm
said.
       ``Arc temperature will go up to about 14,000 degrees Celsius,
from the current level of 12,000 to 13,000 degrees.''
       The sun's surface has been gauged at 6,000 degrees, he added.
