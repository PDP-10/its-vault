    is the cl type system = expert system thing published?
    i'd like to cite it as a reason for my limiting the boxer
    evaluator to seeint numbers, symbols, and vectors with symbols
    in slot 0.

Probably not.  This was Jussi Ketonen who wrote subtypep, or whatever it is
that's at fault.  Maybe Rod has knowledge of a paper that talks about
inefficiencies in the CL type system?
