    Unfortunately, I believe there is no way to use prototypes to give the
    type of variables that you pick up with varargs, so
    "va_arg(var,float);" will never work in draft-ANSI C.
	...At any rate, if you feel strongly about this, you'd be better off
    addressing your complaints to the ANSI committee than to SUN, who do
    have an entirely correct implementation of a crufty, beat-up old
    language.

There are other solutions.  A few years ago, before we were all slimed
on by unix, people used to use another programming language here at
the AI Lab.  Rumor has it the language was developed at MIT, and that
(contrary to popular belief) it was shown to produce excellent
compiled code.

I think it fell into disfavor because its name has too many letters,
and so it is less convenient to invoke than C.  Also, the built-in
function names are long -- many more than six letters.  Unfortunately,
I can't remember the name of the language, but I hear that there is a
version for the Sun.
