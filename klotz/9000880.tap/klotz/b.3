\noindent Dear Sir or Madam:

I am writing to petition for Concurrent Enrollment in Physics 7A (Physics for
Scientists and Engineers).

I am an undergraduate at MIT, in my senior year in the Department of
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.  I was admitted to MIT in
1979, and have taken two leaves of absence to do research at the MIT Logo
Laboratory in educational computing, and to work in industry bringing the
research results to market.  I have supported myself and paid my own
tuition at MIT with earnings from my work in computer science.

In 1983 I became involved in the "Boxer" educational computing project
with Prof.  Andrea diSessa, who was then co-chair of the Educational
Computing Group at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science.  I continued
to work on the Boxer project at MIT after Prof. diSessa received his
appointment from U.C. Berkeley, in cooperation with with his research
group in the Education in Math, Science, and Technology program, while
continuing my undergraduate studies at MIT.  

1988 marks last year of the five-year NSF-sponsored research program under
which most of the Boxer research has been done.  I would like to work more
closely with the Berkeley group in the final stages of the project.  Also,
as I am self-supporting, I need the job in order to continue paying my
educational and living expenses.

Unfortunately, working means once again suspending my academic studies at
MIT.

In order to graduate from MIT, I must complete two to three EECS
department requirements, one Physics requirement, and one Humanities
requirement.  Only one of the department courses is offered at MIT in the
Spring semester, so the majority of my courses at MIT would not be in my
major field.

I have proposed to Prof. diSessa that I take my two remaining
non-department requirements at Berkeley, and work for his research group
half-time.  I am sending this letter by way of Prof. diSessa's office, and
have asked him to include a letter with his recommendations.
