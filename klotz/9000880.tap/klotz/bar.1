1.  ${\mit C}\(\inf\) = \{ {\textstyle continuous functions} f\(x\), 
{\textstyle continuous for all\} x}$\\
  $\(f \oplus g\)\(x\) = f\(x\) + g\(x\)$\\
  $\(f \otimes g\)\(x\) = f\(x\) \times g\(x\)$\\

Not an integral domain because\\
$a \, b = 0, a \neq 0$ does not imply $b = 0$\\
E.g.,\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
So $a\(x\) \, b\(x\) = a \otimes b \(x\)$ is identically zero, but neither $a$ nor
$b$ is zero.  Thus, ${\mit C}\(\inf\)$ is a commutative ring.
\\
\\
${\mit C}_{a} = \{f \in {\mit C\(\inf\)} | f\(a\) = 0\}$\\
The set of all continuous functions of $x$ with a zero at $a$.\\
There is no multiplicative identity function $i\(x\)=1$ since $i\(a\)$ must be 0.\\
Therefore, not a ring.\\
\\
\\
${\mit M}_{2}\({\cal Z}_{2}\) = \{2 \times 2 {\textstyle matrices with entries 
in} {\cal Z}_{2}\}\\
A commutative ring.  Not an integral domain because\\
$\[ \begin{array}{c} 1&1\\1&1 \end{array} \] \[ \begin{array}{c} 1&1\\1&1 \end{array} \] = \[ \begin{array}{c} 0&0\\0&0 \end{array} \] = 0$\\
but neither factor is $0$.

\\
{\mit Z}_{101} is a field -- narrowest classification.
