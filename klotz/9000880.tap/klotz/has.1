Dear Mr. Hasegawa,

I was pleased to hear from you.  I'm glad to hear that you have found a
new company and are enjoying your work.

I'm a student again, and hope to graduate next year.  The Boxer project
has moved to Berkeley, because Andy diSessa is now a professor there.  I
work there during the summers and in January.  We expect to have a version
of Boxer running on Sun III 68020 computers available for university use
this year.

I'm sorry to hear about the problems you had with Leona.  It seems like
Japan is not very interested in Logo these days.  Terrapin, too, is no
longer as big as it was.  Patrick Sobalvarro and I wrote a version of Logo
for the Macintosh for them, but they haven't sold many copies.  I
understand that Mr. Goto left UNY and is now working for an industrial
education company.

Thank you for the books.  I know the founder of Lotus, Mitch Kapor.  He
will be a visiting researcher in our group for the next year.  He's not
here yet, but when he arrives I will ask him who I should send your book
to.  It may be a month or so before he arrives, but I think it would be a
good idea to wait.

There is a chance I might be working in Japan this summer.  If so, I'd
like to say hello to you and your wife, and see your new daughter, and of
course visit your parents if they have time.  I enjoyed staying with them
very much, and often wonder how they are getting along.

Please give my regards to everyone.  Good luck at Audemain.


Sincerely,
