\begin{center}{\large \em Modern Times}\end{center}

{\em Modern Times} was made in a time when the language of film was
well developed.  Chaplin was a gifted filmmaker, and used his talents
well in acting in, and directing this film to produce a complex work
which articulates its themes in multiple ways.  {\em Modern Times} is
both a last hurrah for the silent movie, and a warning about the
dangers of a possible future way of life.

Made during the Depression, the film explores labor and social
problems that were then apparent.  The film is concerned that big
business does not care about people.  By using machines and tools as
major forces in his movie, the movie points an accusing finger at
bottom-line capitalism and its institution, the factory.  Although the
factory was already well established, the period of rapid industrial
growth in the early 20th century produced the assembly line.  It is
now generally understood that (in Western culture, at least) working
on an assembly line is boring and taxing and will drive you crazy.
Chaplin understands the dehumanization that the assembly line brings
about.  Articles are no longer made by artisans, but by people working
like the sheep in the opening sequence of the film.  Chaplin takes on
the role of the lone black sheep in the opening sequence.

A second set of themes concerns the movie itself, as an art form, a medium
of communication, and as a machine.  Silent movies are still viable,
Chaplin says.  Actions are louder than words, in other words.  Movies are
powerful things.  This movie itself is a proof of all three statements.
In some sense these are secondary themes, but they are interwoven with the
socio-economic themes, and also serve as supporting devices in the
articulation of the primary themes.

By 1936, it was understood that the experience of watching a movie is
not the same as experiencing reality, and need not necessarily imitate
it.  The thing in human experience that the movie is most like is the
dream, but it is someone else's, very orderly dream.  Like in dreams,
devices (both props and devices of plot) have multiple, simultaneous
meanings and multiple uses.  Broadly speaking, the machine in
{\em Modern Times} stands for a kind of inexorable social
change not necessarily for the better: Machines control people, or at
least control most people who encounter them in {\em Modern
Times}.  Each machine, though, has some purpose in real life,
and motivation in the movie also.  Sometimes the motivation is purely
to advance the plot, but sometimes it articulate expresses a subtheme
or sets up tension with another theme.  Like in a dream
interpretation, it is difficult to work these separate functions into
a succinct, whole interpretation.  It is better to start from the
machines themselves and try to understand their individual roles.

Most of the machines in the two factories perform no obvious function,
like the machines in the earlier film {\em Metropolis} or the recent
{\em Brazil}.  However, unlike the machines in those films, the {\em
Modern Times} ones are very clean and stylish.  Most of them are
visually appealing.  Sometimes they are daunting, with a multitude of
switches and knobs.  There is an overwhelming abundance of large,
exposed gears.  The machines are not in general familiar ones, but
quite abstract objects which can be understood only to stand for the
category ``machine.''

The first machines shown are large, apparently internally rotating
machines which look like motors or generators.  Their function, taken
together with their size, makes them initial representatives of power in
the movie.

One of the machines in the first factory, the Electro Steel Corp., which
does have a clear function is the large ``TV'' screen that the president
uses to give orders and to spy on workers.  (TV had been invented and was
known, but had not yet been demonstrated at the 1939 World's Fair.  Thus,
Chaplin was being futuristic, but not implausible.)  The TV screen serves
an important function in the plot of the movie, allowing the president to
speak, and making his orders become orders coming from a machine.  Later,
the president uses it to tell the Tramp what to do even in the bathroom on
his own time.

The large control panel staffed by a strong young man with no shirt also
has the direct function of controlling the factory, but exactly what the
levers and wheels do is never clear.  It seems to require little
attention, as the man is usually somewhere else when ordered by the
president to control something in the factory.  The TV panel and the
control panel serve as a non-human top node in the control of the workers.
[The man with no shirt seems somewhat animal-like, but he is also virile
because of his body and because he is a potent link in the chain of
command. So what?] 

At the bottom level is a machine which the people use directly in their
jobs.  People work together on the assembly line and the conveyer belt
which it comprises.  The workers do not like each other because they
interact only when something goes wrong.  There is music associated with
the assembly line machine.  It is a fast, lilting tune.  We first see the
Tramp when he works on this assembly line, tightening bolts with a wrench
in each hand. The Tramp looks like he is playing music when he turns the
bolts with the two wrenches.

Eventually the routine and the pace of the labor get to him, and he goes
crazy.  In his efforts to reach bolts he has missed, he goes further and
further towards the entrance to the machine to which the conveyer belt is
connected, and despite the efforts of his co-workers, eventually enters
the machine.  He seems to want to go inside the machine.  Indeed, there is
both an aspect of muted sexuality to the scene, as the Tramp, brandishing
phallic wrenches, enters the machine through a small opening.  Once he is
inside, though, the music changes to something like a lullaby, and we see
a side view.  What had been a frightening, frenetic machine is now now
pleasant, and surprisingly not dangerous.  The large gears also have a
kind of Art Decco flair to them, and are bright and clean.  The Tramp
tightens bolts on them, and moves through the machine in graceful curves.

Now we see that the tramp is protected from the outside in a womb-like
environment.  The co-workers reverse the machine, and the Tramp emerges, as
if he were born from the machine.  His earlier frenzy continues, but this
time he performs spontaneous physical association in a child-like,
unthinking way.  First he tightens bolts on work pieces, and but then
applies the wrenches to the chest of one of his male co-workers.  A
shapely secretary with breast buttons that appear to fit the wrench comes
by, and he chases her off-camera.  Taken together, these two people are a
surrogate, breast-feeding mother, and the Tramp an infant, but the real
mother is the machine.  The new, crazed Tramp is a product of his modern
environment.

However, the machines do form a kind of escape for the Tramp, and for the
audience, so the relationship is ambiguous.  Almost all of the action in
the scenes in both factories centers on the machines, or on the Tramp and
the machines.  The Factory is a sort of never-never land full of large,
clean, machines with lots of big gears.  When the Tramp is working with
the machines, we are entranced with the pure physical aspects of what he
is doing.  The physical humor and appeal of these scenes is a distraction
from the realities of the workplace, and the labor and economic problems
of the real world.

For example, in the second factory when the Tramp works with the mechanic
and the mechanic gets trapped in the machine, we suspend disbelief and
laugh at the way the Tramp tries to free him.  Then, the foreman comes to
tell the mechanic that a strike has been called, and never-never-land mood
vanishes as the harsh reality of the world and its labor problems
reasserts itself.  The Tramp brings the mechanic ``down to earth'' on the
conveyer belt, just as he himself is brought down to earth from a lift
hook at the end of his mania in the first factory.

Early in the first factory, scene some representatives of another company
want to demonstrate a feeding machine to the Electro Steel Corp.
president.  The Billows Feeding Machine is designed to feed employees
while they work.  

The representatives wheel the machine onto the factory floor and strap the
Tramp in.  At first all goes according to plan, with the soup being poured
gently in to his mouth.  The mouth wipe, though surprising, is also gentle
(and even genteel, in reference to Chaplin's aristocratic mien).  As the
meal progresses (or, is progressed) the machine goes awry and pours soup
on the Tramp.  It then quite viciously attacks the Tramp several times,
with its corn feeder.  Despite the violence of the scene, its absurdity
makes it quite humorous.

The technicians are not concerned about the Tramp, but do stop to adjust
the machine and ladle in more soup.  This time, through human accident,
the machine force-feeds the Tramp two bolts like the ones he has been
tightening all day, and then uses the mouth wipe to keep them in his
mouth.  At this point, Chaplin introduces the ancient pie-in-the-face gag,
in this brilliant, elaborate mechanized setting.  The machine attempts to
feed the Tramp desert, but succeeds in putting pie in his face.  The
feeding machine then attacks the Tramp viciously with the mouth wipe.

The feeding machine is easily the most malevolent machine in the entire
movie, but the president is unaffected.  He dismisses the machine and its
creators with the solid, capitalistic, ``It's not practical.''

Oil cans also play a role throughout the film.  The oil can represents a
basic need the machine has for human attention.  In the first factory, the
Tramp on his crazy rampage runs about squirting everyone in the face with
an oil can, as if he were spitting.  When the ambulance drivers take his
can away, he has another one ready.

In the second factory sequence, the Tramp accidently allows an oil can to
be squashed in a hydraulic press, much to the dismay of the mechanic,
whose job it is to fix the machines and keep them running.  The Tramp points
out that the oil can is now a shovel or a hoe, but the mechanic dismisses
these simple tools of an more earthy lifestyle.  The hydraulic press is
one of the few recognizable machines in the movie, and seems to be present
only to squash things accidently.  When the Tramp puts the mechanic's coat
and watch on the press work surface, the fact that it looks like a clothes
press and has already destroyed one oil can make it virtually certain that
it will smash all three objects; but he has learned, and saves the oil can
at the expense of the mechanic's heirloom pocket watch, now comically
flattened.  This entire sequence seems to advance the thematic material
very little if at all, and serves mostly to provide comedy.  The hydraulic
press and oil can are indeed atypical machines in that they are familiar
machines and tools whose function is clear.

Much of the rest of the second factory sequence is a mirror of the first
sequence.  The Tramp, through only a small amount of ineptitude, manages
to drop tools into the a large machine of unclear purpose.  It spits the
tools out at the Tramp and the mechanic.  Soon afterward, it engulfs the
unwitting mechanic (rather than the willing Tramp).  Chaplin uses this
opportunity to construct an ad hoc feeding machine, wherein the Tramp
feeds the mechanic his lunch while he is still inside the machine.  This
scene, thus, provides some familiarity in its echoing of the previous
machine scenes, and reinforces the thematic elements those scenes present.
The the man inside the machine, and the recalcitrant machine, and the
feeding machine are all reiterated in this scene.

One of the two most important statements of the movie themes of the film
comes in the feeding machine introduction in the first factory.  This
thematic statement is powerful because it comes in the same package as a
statement of the socio-economic themes.  In the Electro Steel Corp., when
the Billows Feeding Machine representatives first arrive, they wheel into
the president's office a large, windswept machine vaguely reminiscent of a
platter of food under a silver dome.  The inventor of the machine is
dressed formally, and looks somewhat like a waiter. (The Tramp later gets
a job as a waiter, and carries around a silver platter of food.)

The Billows eeding machine is promoted on a purely capitalistic basis:
``Be ahead of your competitor.''  There is no human motivation at all,
no compassion for the worker.  The machine is even introduced by
another machine, a gramophone, which describes the feeding machine in
terms of its ``aerodynamic streamlined design,'' ``smoothness of
operation,'' and ``synchromesh transmission.''  All three terms could
describe automobiles of the era, and along with other less meaningful
terms, impart a 1930's futuristic flavor to the machine.

No human speaks directly in this scene, or in any other scene in the
movie, as it is indeed a ``silent'' film.  (It is true that a group of people
sing at the end, and the Tramp himself sings alone, but in a nonsense
foreign language.)  Even the company president, who speaks through the
TV-device in other scenes, doesn't speak here.  The gramophone intones one
of the themes of the entire movie, in prefacing its request for a
demonstration by saying, ``...for actions speak louder than words.''

The movie itself tells the audience that ``actions speak louder than words''
in a subtle, profound way that is at the same time entertaining.  The
gramophone spoken phrase falls flat and is ignored along with the rest of
the advertising puffery to which the audience was no doubt inured.  In
this scene, we are reminded that a movie is a kind of mechanism, and like
the rest of the machines in the movie, is a powerful tool available for
use or misuse.

Chaplin the director articulates the social themes of the movie with
clarity and understanding, and shows that he is a skillful operator of the
movie machine.  In not using speech in the movie, he is showing the power
of silent movies, and of visual images in general.  But in having one of
his central points introduced in speech by a machine, he is acknowledging
changes in the world which are leading to the demise of the silent movie,
and at the same time to changes which are depersonalizing and mechanizing
daily life.  Chaplin uses machines to stand for this depersonalization.  By
making the machines in the movie conform to trends in the art of the day,
he also uses them to show the era's fascination with machines.

It is ironic that today, when the world is much more mechanized than
it was in 1936, society agrees with Chaplin that it is the visual
image which holds the most power, and has learned to exploit that
power in just the ways that Chaplin feared other machines would be
used to shape and control people's lives.

\begin{center}{\large {\em Lonely Villa} and {\em A Beast at Bay}}\end{center}

These D. W. Griffith short films are not comparable to {\em Modern
Times} on the basis of artistic merit, a fact not surprising as {\em
Modern Times} was made nearly thirty years after them.  Griffith's
greatest strength as a director was in his technical developments,
whereas Chaplin's was his artistic developments.

Nevertheless, Griffith's films capture the {\em zeitgeist}, and
represent a way of perceiving the world which is, although perhaps
less conscious than Chaplin's articulation, an expression of social
ideals.

In some of Griffith's films, machines play a substantial role in advancing
the plot.  Their part in these two films is confusingly similar.  In both
films, one or more women are in danger, and various kinds of technology
are used in attempts to save them.  In contrast with Chaplin's film, the
machines are quite realistically portrayed.  They are grubby, work-a-day
machines, and yet they have power over the people who would use them.

In {\em Lonely Villa}, (see Appendix I), the husband makes
sure to lock the window and leave his wife with a loaded handgun when
he has to leave the house unexpectedly.  While he is away, burglars
break into the house and threaten his family.

Coincidentally, the husband's car breaks down and he uses a telephone
to call his wife.  Although the telephone had been established since
the mid-1870's, it was still a technological kind of machine.
Griffith takes care to include a Bell Telephone sign in front the
hotel where the car fortuitously breaks down.  The husband finds out
by phone that his family is in danger, but he cannot use the car to
save them.  He has been failed by his dependence on modern technology.
The failure of the car to start can also be taken as a metaphor of
impotence.

When he returns to the telephone to tell his wife about the car, he remembers
the revolver, and tells his wife to use it.  Unfortunately for them, one
of the burglars has removed the bullets from the gun.  The husband
gestures to himself strongly, saying that he did load the gun.  Once
again, the dependency on a machine to operate as expected turns into a
failure to save the family.  The gun is a kind of extended presence of the
husband, a connection strengthened when he gestures to himself in
connection with the weapon.  Once again, it is difficult to avoid the
suggestions of impotence in the husband's gun not firing.

Just then, burglars cut the wires and the husband is again foiled in
his attempts to help his wife with technology.  He beats a desk in
frustration, and goes out to try the car again, but is told that it
still will not go.  This time in his frustration he clenches his fists
and gesticulates wildly.  Meanwhile, the burglars begin to attack an
interior door of the house with a crowbar and pliers.

The husband and some policemen run towards a horse and buggy that they
spot.  They successfully commandeer the vehicle and take off.  At the same
time, the villains also succeed in using their own simple tools, and break
down the door.

In an unintentionally comic moment, the wife and daughters flee to a
further inner room and close the door, but the burglars are strong and
break through.  One of them grabs the wife and imperils her while another
looks for valuables.  Just then the husband and the police burst into the
room and save the day.

{\em A Beast at Bay} also involves the failure of machines to operate
as expected, and uses this failure to make statements about masculine
power.  In {\em Beast,} the male protagonist is shown to be
unmanly early in the film.  He has no car, and the woman (Ruth) offers
to drive him home.  On the way to their car, the two are accosted by a
drunk, and the man does not defend Ruth's honor.  Ruth drives him
home, and asks him to get out.

On her way away, a ``minor mishap'' (she drops her scarf) forces Ruth to
stop.  An escaped convict forces her to drive him to safety.  

The earlier man just happens to have a pair of binoculars with which he
sees this interchange.  He runs about ineffectually, bumping into people
while trying to find a car.  Eventually he seizes on the idea of taking
the train.

The filming of moving trains already had a history by the time
Griffith made {\em Beast.} Trains are visually exciting in
movies, and exciting in physical presence.  Trains are also a symbol
of male potency.  Griffith needs little provocation to include a
racing train sequence in any movie.

However, Griffith includes a puzzling scene.  When the man goes to the
train, an engineer is oiling the wheels with an oil can, and refuses to
help at all.  The man is unable to make the train go.  He is frustrated in
his attempts to help the lady of his desires.  He runs off to the station,
and leaves alone, but when he arrives at the train one of the policemen
seems to have turned into a station master, whom he presumably brought
from the station.  All board the train, including the previously
recalcitrant engineer.  This scene is nothing if not confusing, but the
interpretation of the train as an inherently unreliable machine casts some
light at least on its motivation.

Back in the car, Ruth pretends that the car will not go.  The criminal
wastes no time in forcing her to drive on.  Her ploy that the machine is
broken will not work with a powerful, animalistic man.  In this scene,
Griffith shows his Victorian attitudes about men and women fairly clearly.
Even though he has allowed Ruth to be strong earlier, in the face of an
encounter with a ``real man'' she is unable to take care of herself.

The rest of {\em A Beast at Bay} is a standard train-car
chase sequence, with an additional car thrown in when the train tracks
diverge from the road.  The man gets the girl in the end, and the
criminal is recaptured.  All of this happens through the benefits of
cars and trains, but there are many false starts and failures along
the way, showing that the machines are unreliable.

Griffith is undoubtedly a strongly moralistic film director.  These films
have a strong undercurrent of a fear of dependence on machines, and
especially modern technology.  The technology with which Griffith is most
intimately connected is the movie.  Whereas Chaplin has fairly clearly
used the gramophone and the mock-television screen to stand for movies,
Griffith has less clearly and perhaps less consciously used other, more
remote machines.  His fear of dependence on machines could also be
interpreted as an unconscious desire not to be associated with them, and
hence some reservations about making movies.

An alternative explanation of this undercurrent is a desire to return
to an earlier way of life.  {\em A Corner in Wheat}
celebrates the simple beauty of a rustic life through cinematography
and through the occupation of its protagonists, but this theme is
secondary to the socio-economic examination of the stereotypical
greedy capitalist.  Since meaning in movies is multi-faceted, these
various interpretations of the importance of the failure of machines
in Griffith's films are not necessarily incompatible.

\begin{center}{\large Appendix I: {\em Lonely Villa} Summary of Relevant Shots}\end{center}


(1-5) (establishment of three burglars outside and family inside)

(6-7) Husband at home with wife and three girls.  Burglars deceive him into
leaving the house by sending one of their number in to deliver a fake
letter.  He locks the window, loads a gun, and gives it to his wife.  He
calls for a car and leaves.  While he isn't paying attention, the
messenger burglar unloads the gun.

(8-9) (burglars outside)

(10) The husband calls for a car, gets onto it and is driven away.

(11-18) The burglars break down the door and rush into the house.  The
wife and children hide in a room and use furniture to block the door.  The
men use a crowbar to try to open the door.

(19-25) The car breaks down in front of a hotel with a Bell Telephone
sign.  The husband goes to the phone to call his wife, and finds out the
burglars are in the house and his family is trapped.  The husband, still
on the phone to his wife, raises his right arm and gestures to the car.
The next shot is of the wife, standing in the same position, with her
right arm already up, gesturing to the robbers.  She brings her hand down.
The husband runs out to the car but is told it still won't start.

(26) One of the robbers leaves to cut the phone wires.

(27-33) The husband comes back to the phone and continues to talk to his
wife. He makes his right hand look like a gun, and repeatedly makes
violent firing gestures.  The wife gets the gun and the man continues to
make firing gestures.  The wife points the gun in the general direction of
the door and pulls the trigger.  Nothing happens.  The wife checks the gun
and reports that the chamber is empty.  The man excitedly points to
himself and indicates that he personally loaded the gun.

(34-37) At this point we see one of the burglars cut the telephone wires
at the house.  The husband and the wife both excitedly click at the
telephone.  The man gives up and pounds the reception desk in frustration.
The husband runs out to the car, leaving a hotel clerk to talk into the
telephone, presumably to an operator, since he actually appears to be
having a conversation.

(38) The car still won't start.  The husband clenches his fists and
waves his arms in frustration.  Two policemen have appeared and one
points into the distance.  All run off.

(40) In the meantime, the robbers are trying to open the door with a pair of
pliers and a crowbar.

(41) The man and the police come to a group of people who have a carriage
and two horses.  They commandeer the vehicle and take off.

(42) The burglars succeed in breaking open the door, but just as they come
through the wife and daughters retreat to another room and close that
door.

(43)  The carriage continues to race towards the house.

(44) The burglars attack the next door with the crowbar.

(45) The women push from the other side

(46) The carriage comes around a corner.

(47) The wife and children try to hold the door by themselves, without
furniture.  The burglars push open the door.  One grabs the wife while
another rummages through drawers.  Just at that moment, the husband and
the police burst in the room and capture the robbers.  The man comforts
his wife and daughters.
