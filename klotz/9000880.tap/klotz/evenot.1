Prof. Draper,

I've tried to cut down on the verbiage at least some.

This paper is built along somewhat the same lines as my Chaplin/Machines
paper.  This time I've picked an element of the plot and shown its
interconnections with a structural element of the film.

When I saw _The Lady Eve_, I was at a loss to explain the severity of the
punishment Jean metes out in terms of the plot without resorting to a
psychological argument which makes it seem likely that Jean will decieve
and mistreat Charles in the future.

In this paper I've given the plot element (the relationship themes) less
attention than the structural element (the integration of Jean the
character and Jean the "director").

In particular, I haven't shown convincingly why Jean falls in love with
"Hopsy," either in the context of the plot or in terms of my thesis.

A more serious problem is with my thesis itself:  I haven't given any
motivation for the use of the Jean-as-director device, other than as a
metaphor for ideas of control and dominance in relationships.  I think it
may be possible to explain the connection in feminist terms, but I really
have no idea what motivated Sturges to use the device.
