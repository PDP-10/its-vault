     This is a notice to all Mac users who are either interested or
would like to use the Japanese language.

     "Basic House" located in the prefecture of Tochigi in Japan has
started the shipment of a Japanese language printer interface box by the
name of Print Jack as of May 11.  The retail price is 45,000 yen.

     Print Jack enables the connection of the Mac to various 24-dot
Kanji printers sold by, for instance, Epson, NEC and Brother.  By using
it along with Kanji Talk or Egword, the use of kanji and graphics will
be possible.

     The following is a list of Kanji Printers which may be connected
(the model numbers are those of domestic models in Japan):

     NEC:  PC-PR201   Epson:  HG-2500   Brother:  M-1724P   Star:  AR-2410
           PC-PR101           VP-2500             M-1024P          TR-24CL
           PC-PR406           VP-135K
           NM-9000            VP-130K
           PC-PR-TL           VP-85K

     Since the Imagewriter uses an 8-dot printer head, there was always
a problem that the printed image of a complicated kanji character did
not appear as clearly as it should.  In Japan, therefore, various
companies have come up with printers having very fine 24-dot printer
heads.  Unfortunately, it was not possible to connect the Mac with these
printers.  One software company came up with a printer driver for the
Epson Kanji Printer.  This, however, could not print out graphics.

     Of the printers listed hereinabove, for instance Epson's ink-jet
printer HG-2500 has not only Kanji characters (JIS-1, JIS-2) but some
English fonts in its ROM.  As a matter of course, the English fonts
printed out using it are very beautiful.  In the case of other printers
which do not have English fonts in their ROMs, the English fonts will be
printed out using the 8-dot mode. However, even in this case, the fonts
printed out using such printers will be more precise due to the fact
that it uses a finer pin.  Empirically, graphics printed out using these
printers appear to be slightly smaller than those printed out using
Imagewriter.

     The size of Print Jack is the same as Apple's 800K external drive.
The price includes that of the AC/DC converter.

be very helpful to those who wish to print out clear Japanese writing.
