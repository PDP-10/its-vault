Friday mornings are out due to classes.  I can make it Wednesday
afternoon, as that's when I'm usually there for work anyway.  Sorry
I can't make it any other times.

As far as this week's meeting (which I can't make), don knows of a
bunch of fairly smooth demos in a directory named "demo."  On Wednesday
I'll try to put a few more in -- for instance the 21 game we've
worked out for stats, and possibly some beginning of a probability
microworld which teaches kids probability from the old technique
of drawing from an urn.  Doubt this will be in any working condition,
though.

Good luck at Xerox, and that "coming-out" party sounds fantastic.

See you,

Dear Leigh,

I think you are grown up enough to visit Laurel, but probably shouldn't.
There are two reasons:  one is that it's awfully expensive and your
money and time situations are not too good.   (I mean her life doesn't
actually depend on people like you and me visiting so money is a
consideration.)  Also, now that she's out of the sterile environment
(when I talked to her she was behind plastic) she needs to restrict how
many people she sees so as not to be exposed to so many germs.  She'll
be back in December.  However, something you can do is send her
something for the apartment, which is pretty bare.  But whatever you
send her should be basically cleanable and clean.  For example, leather
is not good, plants are completely out.  She has more stuffed animals
than one would think possible.  I am going to send her a poster which
she was talking about when I was there.  She has a MacIntosh, a VCR, a
CD player---so things for those might be good.  Why, you could even call
her on the phone!  

Actually, also, Leigh, I spent alot of time with Michael Fredkin while I
was there, because he was kind of freaking out.  The reason that he was
freaking out is that it's so hard to accept that you can't actually do
anything.  I'm sort of used to the concept, having worked in hospitals
and all, but I think it would be hard for you, you'd get kind of
miserable.  Perhaps that's what you mean by wondering if you're grown up
enough---I know you are at base, but your relationship with Laurel is
very complex.  I wouldn't say the same thing if it were me, not because
of it being "me" but because we have a less conflicted relationship.

Better do some work,

dgt

We would like to spend some time this week talking, perhaps showing
demos of Boxer.  (The reason is Boxer's "coming out party" in January
at a national conference hosted by EMST and the Lawrence Hall -- we
hope).  It is also true I am scheduled to give a Boxer demo at Xerox
PARC in a week or so (Ed, we need to worry about how to get a Boxer
with demo files down there a bit.)  Bring your favorite ideas and a
hand to volunteer for more.

It is also true that our usual time, Thurs. at 2, appears to be
getting worse and worse -- people are having more schedule conflicts.
This poses serious problems as Hal, for example, can only make it on
Thurs. or possibly Fri Morn.  (I would ordinarily try for some time on
Weds. afternoon (early or late).  How would Fri. morn be for folks?
For my info., also let me know if Weds. would work.  It's too bad to
be losing so many Boxer folks from meeting for scheduling conflicts.

Dear Leigh,

Is Noyuri going to be here for one day only?  I would love to see her,
but am quite busy that Sunday.  Perhaps she'll be here a couple of days?

Leigh, I have to write a preface to the Japanese edition of my book.
Could you vet it so that it will make sense when they translate it?

I may be in Boston for a day or so in November.  It looks like it, even.

Laurel looked really well.  I was glad I went up.

[JOCK -- PLEASE COUNT THIS AS 15 MINUTES BUG TIME. -- LEIGH]

Hello. I intend to go there tomorrow.

The only reason for STAMPTEXT to complain about not liking 12 would be if
the guy changed the font size to be something bigger.  Like maybe he has
made the default font be something else using the Configuration program.
The width and height can't be too small or else the Mac internal character
printing routine will crash.  In order to avoid that lossage, STAMPTEXT
refuses to stamp into an area that's too small.  Since it doesn't crash
for you, and he hasn't modified the program, he must have changed the font
size, either with Configure or automatically (because he's in Switzerland)
as part of the International Utilities package.

  He was also pissed because he insists that nowhere in the documentation
  does it state that the files contained in the Logo System folder have to
  be kept in that folder, even under HFS (I did mention that in the update
  letter I sent out to people, but he's right that it is not stated anywhere
  in the documentation.
I can hardly say anything about this.  When the manual was published there
was no HFS compatibility.  I went through the version you have and put in
notes about all the things that needed to be documented.  I'm sure that's
one of them.  Also "even under HFS" is a misconception -- it's "only under
HFS."  If he REALLY wants to, he can use the Apple Resource Editor
(RESEDIT) to change the string resource in Logo that says "Logo Folder" to
say "Faulde du Logeau" or whatever he wants in whatever langue or lingue
he speaks.  

See, I thought of everything.  It's just not an option in Configure
because it's supposed to be for translations.

See you soon,
Leigh.

Hi Leigh.

Sorry, but it's another Logo for Mac question.

This guy in Switzerland says the Logo Demo is buggy for the following
reason:

When it prints...

	The shape of any turtle can be changed.  Here, turtles
	are given the shape of letter tiles.

Logo crashes and says...

	STAMPTEXT didn't like 12 as input.
	It expected a number greater than or equal to 14 at level 3 in line
	(STAMPTEXT FIRST :STRING 12 12 0) of TILESHAPE

That line is indeed there, but why STMPTEXT should complain is beyond me.
Anyway, we had the demo running for hours at the ECCO conference just a
few days ago and it never crashed.

He was also pissed because he insists that nowhere in the documentation
does it state that the files contained in the Logo System folder have to
be kept in that folder, even under HFS (I did mention that in the update
letter I sent out to people, but he's right that it is not stated anywhere
in the documentation.

Any ideas?

Thanks, Alison.

P.S. It looks like we'll never come out with an IBM Logo at this rate.
Brian's not going to do it, I know.  I'm not even sure that he will ever
finish Logo PLUS (the ProDOS version.  This is the second time he's said
it would take a few weeks and it's now been a few months!  Any guesses
about why it's taking him so long (except for the obvious, which is that
this place is depressing).  Sigh.

BRINGING UP BABIES
 
  -- Dave Barry
 
The main thing you should know about raising extremely young babies is that,
physically, they are not at all like you.
 
If you were to open up a baby--and I am not for a moment suggesting that you
should--you would find that 87 percent of the space normally reserved for
bodily organs is taken up by huge, highly active drool glands.  Famous child
psychologists like to go around claiming that, even at a very early age,
babies are learning about spatial relationships, etc., but the truth is that
for the first two or three months all they do is drool.
 
Oh, I'm not saying babies don't have moods.  They have three of them:
 
Mood One:  Just about to cry.
Mood Two:  Crying.
Mood Three:  Just finished crying.
 
Your job, as parent, is to keep the baby in Mood Three as much as possible.
This means you have to figure out why it's crying.  Here's a tip:  Babies
never cry because their diapers are full.  You change their diapers only to
make yourself feel better.  You could leave the same diaper on a baby for
months, and the baby would be perfectly happy, although considerably heavier
and less pleasant to be around.
 
So that leaves only two reasons why your baby cries:
 
1.  It is hungry.
2.  Some other reason.
 
If your baby is hungry, you should feed it.
 
You can either bottle-feed or breast-feed your baby.  Many noted health
fanatics recommend breast-feeding on the grounds that it is good for the
baby.  This may be true, but for fathers the real advantage is that only
women can do it.  This means fathers don't have to get up at the insane
hours babies like to get up.
 
At first you may feel guilty, and you'll get up in the middle of the night
to give your wife moral support.  But after a while you learn how to do
so without waking up.  In the morning, when she's exhausted, you can 
commiserate with her.  You can say, "I know how you feel.  This morally
supporting is no bed of roses, either."  She'll appreciate this.
 
If your baby doesn't stop crying after you feed it, you should hand it
back and forth and say, "I wonder what could be wrong?"  This does
no good whatsoever, but it passes the time.  You can also try making funny
faces and playing funny baby games.  Here are three that I found particularly
effective:
 
 o Oklahoma Baby Chicken Hat:  Grasp your baby and put it on your head 
   like a hat, stomach down; then stride around the room and cluck like
   a chicken in time to "Surry With The Fringe on Top", bouncing in time
   to the music.
 
 o Wild Teenage Babies From Outer Space:  Lie on your back and hold your
   baby over you, facing down.  Move it slowly up and down, like a flying
   saucer, making flying-saucer-like noises and feigning great fear when
   the baby appears to be about to land on Planet Earth.
 
Note:  Wear protective clothing for the preceding two games.
 
 o Attack of the Baby-eaters:  Lay the baby on the floor, face up.
   Announce that you are very hungry, and start nibbling at the baby's
   toes, then its hands, and finally, with great gusto, its stomach.
   Every now and then, yell, "Great baby!  Delicious!"
 
After you've had your baby for a while, you should try feeding it some
solid food.  Many kinds of solid baby foods are available, all of them
disgusting.  The baby food industry takes things that no normal human
being would dream of eating (such as beets), grinds them into mush and puts
them into jars.  Babies would much rather eat the kind of food you eat, such
as cheeseburgers and beer.  But federal law, passed at the insistence of the
immensely powerful baby food lobby, requires you to feed your baby mush.
 
Scientists now know that babies eat solid foods by absorbing them through
their chins, which is where you should smear the mush if you want a healthy
baby.  Many inexperienced parents try to feed babies through their mouths.
This is foolish.  If you put a spoonful of mashed beets into a baby's mouth,
then another, you may think the baby is actually eating the beets, but it is
not.  Those beets will never get near the baby's digestive system.  About
a half hour after you have cleaned up, the baby will start emitting a fine
spray of mashed beets, like a little beet volcano.
 
What the baby will put in its mouth is horrible things.  If you put the baby
on the floor, it will crawl along, looking intently at the floor and ignoring
all the safe, expensive toys and any bits of actual food that have fallen
from the highchair, until it finds, in some corner, a piece of maggot-ridden
waste or, better yet, a small, sharp object covered with lockjaw germs.  
Then, with a motion faster than the adult eye can see, the baby will pop
this horrible thing into its mouth and chew contentedly for the rest of the
afternoon.
 
So, when you see your baby chewing contentedly, you know you have an emergency.
 
Here is the first thing to remember:  You must not try to reach into the
baby's mouth and remove the horrible thing.  Put yourself in the baby's
position:  Here you have worked very hard to find a horrible thing, and along
comes this giant person, perfectly capable of finding his own horrible thing,
to take it away.  You'd rather swallow yours than give it up.
 
So the trick is to come up with something even more horrible than what the
baby has and pretent to offer it in trade.  You'll have to prepare well in
advance because babies are much better than adults at finding horrible things.
So, whenever you're in a disgusting place, such as a public restroom in
northern New Jersey, keep an eye out for something that would attract a baby--
a blob of industrial waste, say, or a decomposed toad that has been lying
on a highway for three weeks.
 
Keep this thing in the refrigerator, away from the potato salad, and use it
to trick the baby into spitting out the horrible thing in its mouth.
 
After a while, babies get to be pretty hard bargainers.  Sometimes they'll
demand two or three things before they'll trade.  You'll find yourself
squatting on the floor like some kind of deranged Arabian rug trader, waving
little plastic bags of sewage or jellyfish parts enticingly in front of your
baby's face as it sits and chews contentedly, waiting for your best offer.
 
It's all part of that special bond that develops between parent and child
during the first year of life.

Right.  Although many of characters of Chinese are familiar,
more or less, to native speakers of Japanese, the grammer is not. 

BTW, the relationship between Korean and Japanese is a contrasted example.
While Korean's peculiar characters (Hangul), and most of its words and idioms,
are entirely unfamiliar to (most of) Japanese people, the grammer is similar
to Japanese one.

came from Portuguese.  Anyway, nowadays we feel it as if peculiar to Japanese.
As Klotz-san says, it is written in kanji ($@1lAp(J), in Hiragana ($@$?$P$3(J),
or in Katakana ($@%?%P%3(J).
(In () are JIS kanji codes.  I wish all of you can see them.)

Wayne Lui san:
> Other times, Japanese just borrowed the SOUND of certain hanji. The word SUSHI,
> although it can be written in kanji, its definition doesn't root from Chinese. 

Moreover, there are several "kanji"s originally created in Japan (in old days).
Thay are called "kokuji" (national character).  The kanji for
"hataraku" (work) ($@F/(J) is an example.


Klotz san:
> A contrasting word is "sebiro," which means "men's suit" and is written "wide
> back," but actually comes from "Seville."

You might be right.  However, I have heard another opinion that the root is
"Civilian suits".

Dear Leigh,

I don't think you don't consider people's feelings.  I think you do,
most of the time anyway.  You are not the absolute most social person in
the world, but I think either Noyuri was just trying to rationalize
things or there was something in particular you had overlooked or done
and she didn't feel she could tell you directly.

I don't see the second season word besides summer.  It must be peculiar
to Japanese.  There is an interesting question: is it that somehow you
were being a strange foreigner in making up haiku and she was
embarrassed, or is it that she was jealous because they are rather cute
and good?

I am going to visit Laurel this weekend.

Since the original messages were not on NIHONGO@MC, I don't know what has
been said already.  I think everyone on Nihongo knows already, but
the clearest way of showing that Japanese and Chinese are different is to
point out that Chinese is, in general, a word order language and Japanese
is, on the whole, an inflected language.  In Japanese, parts of speech
called particles are used to indicate the case of nouns, whereas in
Chinese (as in English) word order is used.  Where word order does count
in Japanese, it is in the clause construction subject-object-verb. In
both Chinese and English the order is SVO.

Chinese bears the same sort of relationship to Japanese that Latin and
Greek do to English: a grammatical influence in classical times and a good
source of roots, prefixes, and suffixes for new words until recently.

A couple of nit-picking points: "tabako" came from Dutch in the 1600's,
and thus ranks as a real Japanese word by being so old.  It has kanji, and
is written "burning weed," but is given a pronounciation which doesn't
match with the characters.   As Wayne Lui points out, though, it is quite
frequently written in hiragana.

A contrasting word is "sebiro," which means "men's suit" and is written "wide
back," but actually comes from "Seville."  In this case the pronounciation
atches, but the meaning is misleading.  Many Japanese people have no clue
as to the origin of this word.  I believe sebiro is usually writen in kanji.

"Tempura" is thought to come from either Portuguese "tempora," meaning
"time" (referring to Catholic religious dietary restrictions) or
"temperato" (referring to seasoning) and is written with three Chinese
characters which have the correct pronounciation but no meaning that I can
discern.  Hiragana is also quite acceptable.

Offhand I don't know of any English words that are regularly written in
kanji, though modern Japanese writers do play language games and do so on
occasion.

When I spoke to Laurel last night, she asked that I take a photograph of the

told her that I didn't have a camera to hand (it's in the back of that
closet), but that I'd arrange that one be taken and sent to her.  Would you
like to be the taker and sender?  She also asked me to check the inside and
see that everything's okay; we think I have a key, and I think she also might
like photographs of the interior.  So perhaps we should undertake a photo

Hello there! You may already have been asked this by someone in our

Louis, I thought I would ask. There is a lot of data left on Joe
related to Boxer and the EC Group (I assume). Is there anything there
that we should save, such as backed up versions of Boxer or peoples
accounts? If there is, then we will be happy to keep it around until
you tell us to blow it away. If there isn't, then we would like to
clean the disk up so as to make backups easier. Incidentally, I just
finished a full dump of Joe Louis, so anything that is currently on
the machine is on tape.  Please respond within a week if possible.
Thanks!

I think this perfectly expresses, better than anything I've ever seen before,

Dear Leigh,

I'm glad to hear from you!  I have been a little bit down.  I've been
working really hard and need to continue doing so at least until the
beginning of December.  It's particularly at times like these that I
miss friends I'm really comfortable with.  I was pretty happy with Susan
as a room-mate, but now I hardly get to see her, and now even Danny's
gone away, so there isn't anyone else out here I feel I can just relax
with.

I can imagine that you're not very happy in school.  However, give it a
try....  If push comes to shove, I would be happy to make you a loan
myself for your tuition.  I don't say that lightly, I take money matters
pretty seriously but when I say it, I really mean it.   You know that I
think your education is really important, and also that I respect your
not signing up for the draft (and also that I care about you).

How is the Wellsley woman?

I spoke to Laurel a little while ago.  The graft has taken, and her counts
are significant now -- her poly count is 80, up from about 20 a few days ago;
her doctors say that when it reaches 500, she'll be released from the
hospital.  They expect that to happen in another two weeks, if everything
goes well; at that point she'll still be very ill, but will be able to live
outside of the hospital.

Laurel had been experiencing a liver problem that is a fairly common side
effect of the treatment, but it responded very well to medication and has now
disappeared.  Her bone marrow was aspirated today, and one result is obvious
right now -- there is a normal (for this stage in the treatment) amount of
marrow present.

Laurel's mouth is feeling much better; she's down to 5mg of morphine per
hour, so she's much more alert.  She has laryngitis right now, so that she
may not enjoy telephone conversations over the next day or two, but it sounds
like she's getting desperately bored in that little LAF room, so letters
would be a good thing to send.

any English-y classes this term? I'm taking one that focusses on the 
1950's spy story genre...short books, things like "The Killer Inside
Me", "Farewell, My Lovely", etc. The books (despite being very easy
to read, and inexpensive) are starting to bother me b/c of their
portrayal of woman: either frighteningly large-chested, or viciously
masochistic. Ick. (Okay, the real reason that I'm even NEAR a terminal
is that I should be typing a paper about one of the abovementioned
"novels"...but I really don't feel like it..)

But, then again, it's due at 5:30.

Take care,

Hey,

I was looking for you today, but you weren't around.  I don't know
where jocks brain is.  This implies that he had one to begin with, and
now it is gone.

Sure, I'll come in here maybe on Saturday early in the day, and we
could thrash the lisa into shape.  If we work this out right, I could
get you a date with my dates friend (no lie, nice looking girl).  The
only drawback to dating these chicks is that they are 20 years old.
Nice looking, good brains, well traveled (just around the world, not
the other way!).  Maybe we could do something stupid, like go to
Harvard Square, where I could kiss my girl so much that the other one
would jump your bones.

Call me at home so we can talk for real (884-5454) and leave your
phone number!

Hookay.  I've finished synching OZ's Babyl to XX's.  My wart on ECC's
original kluge has been transformed into something more palatable.

What isn't done:
o  The EMACS 165/EMACS 169 issue.
o  I haven't even looked at the ITSen to see what their state is.
o  JBA, I haven't acted on the hack you mentioned to me.  It won't
   happen today (I'm waiting to see if I blew it somehow), but
   probably later in the week.

What happened:

I have installed the most recent versions of BABYL and BABYLM from XX.
There were some problems, but things appear to be working okay now.

First, the stuff in XX:PS:<EMACS>BABYL.OZ-INIT-KLUDGE doesn't quite
work.  I'm reasonably sure it's a quoting issue:  the ^]'s in the
string cause ?QNS errors (evaluation of q7 is probably happening too
early) if I try to set the variable that way, and using ^A in place
doesn't cause errors, but the ^A'd items don't seem to match any
strings.  I haven't taken the time to figure this out; since the whole
thing is OZ-specific anyway, I've just substituted MIT-OZ (what would
have been in q7, the idea of the ^]7's) in place.  That variable is
now in OZ's SITE.INIT.

Second, it appears that the process of dumping a Babyl *never* reads
SITE.INIT, nor does the dumped Babyl read SITE.INIT when it comes up.
Hence, the variable setting in SITE.INIT will not take effect for
dumped Babyl's.  (Use @SET TRAP FILE if you don't believe me...  I
found it rather odd, too, since TECO.INIT *is* read, and it sets
*Initializations* to have the right pathname for SITE.INIT.
*Initializations* should get run on entry to ^R mode, and then
EMACS.INIT reads SITE.INIT, but this isn't happening for the
dumping-Babyl case because it never reads EMACS.INIT.  I haven't
pursued this any further than that.)

What I did to fix that was to embed the variable in the
DUMP-BABYL.INIT file as well.  This doesn't seem to me to be a great
idea, since I don't know if that file is sent in a distribution, and
furthermore it means that both locations have to be updated (there are
comments in each location that points at the other).  I'm not sure if
instead maybe DUMP-BABYL.INIT should read the contents of SITE.INIT or
EMACS.INIT.  That seems to be the best way to solve the problem, but
there might be a screw that I don't know about.  If nobody can think
of one, I'll try that solution instead in a week or so.

Subject: profiling


I just profiled the boxer equivalent of CDR'ing down a list (recursively)
and found that the evaluator is chewing up 22 % of the time and that
stack-frame consing is taking up another large chunk of time.  Wasn't there
some sort of stack frame allocator ?  Or am I losing cause IF needs to
cons special kinds of stack frames ?
