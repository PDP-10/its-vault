\maketitle
Jean, a professional gambler, and Charles, a naive young rich man, meet
on a luxury liner.  They fall in love and through some
deception and some misunderstanding, come to hate each other.  Charles
deals with his anger quietly, but Jean embarks on a revenge the
magnitude of which surpasses all reason available within the scope of the
plot.  Her anger is explicable only by appealing to the structure of the
film, which identifies Jean with the director.  This identification, in
turn, calls into question ideas about control, aggression, and passivity in
relationships.

Jean, her father Harry, and a third man are aboard a luxury liner in
search of rich people to bilk.  Jean first sees Charles and decides to
trap him into playing cards with her and her father Harry.  Using a
mirror, she shows the camera various women trying get to his attention, and
describes their actions or perhaps directs them.  She trips Charles when
he comes by, and leads him to her room to get help changing her shoe.

The tripping begins her manipulation of Charles.  For the rest of the
evening she treats him like a buffoon, calling him by his boyhood name
``Hopsy.'' She seats him on the floor, puts her arms around him and plays
with his hair while talking about her ideal man.  ``Hopsy'' endures it all
unquestioningly.  He seems simply too naive.

Eventually, Jean begins to see Hopsy not as a mark or a mug, but as a man.
In his naivete, he is certainly different from her father and gambling
friend.  He must, though, in some way be different from the other men on
whom she must have used her charms before.  Hopsy is the complete mug; he
is entirely too trusting.  Jean thus believes that she can control Hopsy
completely.  Somehow she begins to feel responsible for Hopsy, and wants
to protect him from her father.  In doing so, however, she also orders
Hopsy not to play cards with him.  Thus, in order to protect Hopsy from
his own gullability and passivity she must make use of it.

When Jean first tells Harry of her feelings about Hopsy, she says,
``No, you don't understand; this is real.''  Ostensibly, Jean means real
in the context of the play-acting she and Harry do with all their marks.
But since the mirror scene has strongly identified her with the movie
director, Jean is also foreshadowing her loss of control over Hopsy,
herself, and their relationship.  Jean is not prepared consciously,
though, for the consequences of that necessary loss of control.

Harry agrees not to ``take'' Hopsy, and in turn Jean agrees not to tell
Harry of their true mission until the end of the cruise.  ``A man who
couldn't forgive wouldn't be much of a man,'' she opines.

Soon Hopsy proposes to Jean, and she accepts.  Her last words in the scene
show that she expected the proposal and still feels that she is in charge:
``The moonlit bow of a ship is a woman's business office.''

Unfortunately, Hopsy's factotum Mugsy obtains confirmation of his
suspicion that the three are professional gamblers, and presents it to
Hopsy in the form of a photograph.  Until that point, Hopsy has
rejected Mugsy's assertions as unfounded.  He retires to the bar and
sulks.

Just then Jean comes to meet Hopsy, and, incredibly not sensing his mood,
reveals to him how she set about to catch his heart.  Jean is engaging in
a little rewriting of history, since she had first set out to catch his
wallet, but wound up falling in love with him.  In the light of Hopsy's
new knowledge, though, the admission of her planning is highly damaging.
Jean eventually senses that something is wrong and spies the envelope.
She asks about it, and Hopsy shows her the picture.  Jean realizes that
Hopsy knows all, and says, ``It's not a very flattering image.''  By
discussing images explicitly, Jean is acknowledging that something has
gone awry in her direction.  Assuming that he will forgive her, Jean tells
Hopsy the truth, that she had first set out to rook him but fell in love
with him, and was planning to tell all at the end of the voyage.

Hopsy is left trying to cope with the disillusionment accompanying
learning that he is a gullable character, while in the state of just
having fallen in love for the first time.  He is unable to believe that
Jean could both be in love with him and have tried to deceive him in the
past.  He is unable to untangle the pro-gambler deception, the womanly
entrapment deception, and the simple postponement of disclosure deception.
Hopsy has discovered a new world of being in love, and then lost that
world in finding out that he has been living in a complex world of
deceptions.  To protect himself, he denies ever having been deceived.  He
cannot, though, recover his lost innocence.

Jean believes his denial wholly, and leaves him, saying tearfully, ``If
your intention was to humiliate me you've succeeded admirably.''  Hopsy
makes no reply.

Jean fell in love with Hopsy because his innocence and his unknowing
acceptance of her made her re-evaluate her own life of deception.  She
decided to give up her life of gambling with her father for a new kind
based on trust with Hopsy.  When he claims to have known all along and to
have been been deceiving her, she faces a dilemma: either he is lying
then, or he had been lying in the past.  In either case, she has been
deceived, and loses the grounding for the change in her life.  In
addition, she has lost control of Hopsy and thus also her directorial
control.  

In the next scene, Jean gloats when Harry produces a winnings check that
Jean had thought destroyed.  She plainly despises Hopsy.  Although the
idea of forgiveness has already been discussed, it is not Hopsy's lack of
forgiveness that Jean finds so disturbing at this point; it is the
humiliation resulting from the loss of control and loss of support for her
newly-accepted values that makes Jean so angry at Hopsy.

Some time later, through a chance encounter with an old con-man friend,
Jean hears about Hopsy.  She hatches a plan of deception.  She puts on
airs and a fake British accent and appears at Hopsy's residence as the
Lady Eve.  She calls Hopsy by his given name Charles, and insists that she
has never met him.  In her persence, Charles suffers many falls, and even
gets a pie in the face.  It is clear that Jean has regained control of the
movie, and of Charles.  In the Eve persona, she taunts him cruelly without
his realizing it, and punishes him for having lied to her.  As Jean the
director, she exerts influence slightly outside the plot of the film to
punish him for her loss of control.

Talking to her con-man friend, Jean describes how Eve, by her charm and
physical resemblence to her Jean persona will make Charles fall in love
with her and propose.  The description dissolves into the actual events,
still with the Jean voice-over.  Charlie proposes, in exactly the same
words he used before.  For the audience, the painfulness of her cruelty
reaches its height when she finishes his speech for him.  Completely blind
that he has already to her before, Charlie is only further convinced that
he has found the right woman.

Since the Charles and Eve have now reached the point where Hopsy and Jean
had their confrontation, the audience expects Eve to reveal her true
identify or to disappear.  To do either of these things would be
consistent with Jean's motivation of restoring the consistency of her
world view she lost when Hopsy lied to her.  She has deceived Charles in
the same way that he thought she had before, and in doing could achieve
satisfaction through the deception.  Instead, the movie (with Jean in
charge) proceeds with no intervening dialog to their wedding.  Jean the
director must also get her revenge.

Their honeymoon night takes place on a train.  Charles is still taking
pratfalls at Jean's direction.  She puts into place her master plan: she
has Eve spin incredible stories about her past lovers to an ever more
agitated Charles.  At last, he offers to forgive her.  The forgiveness
that Jean spoke of to her father early in the film is now available to
her.  But it rings hollow both in Henry Fonda's acting and in the face of
the levels of deception.  Eve takes the advantages of Charles's
gullability to hurt him even further, and tell him more stories of more
previous lovers.  Charles reaches his nadir in the next scene, when he
jumps off the train into the mud.

At this point, Charles is clearly to be felt sorry for.  Even if his earlier
unending gullability has made him despicible to both Jean and the
audience, the severity of her punishment has pushed the balance far in his
favor.  Jean, though, has yet to realize this.  She has taught Charles the
final lesson, but has more to learn herself.

On the telephone with Charles's father, Eve insists that Charles come
``ask me to be free.''  Just who will become free is purposefully made
ambiguous.  Charles refuses either to grant her freedom or to beg for it
from her.  The Eve persona is shocked, as is Jean the director.  Again,
she has somehow lost control of Charles.

We next see Charles aboard a luxury liner, just as at the beginning of the
film.  Jean trips him again, but this time the tripping is shown from
outside her point of view.  We neither see Jean, nor see what she sees.
Jean has lost control of what the audience sees, but she retains some of
her old influence over Charles.

Charles is so happy to see Jean that he forgets about having fallen, and
forgets the anger present when they parted.  He takes Jean by the arm and
pulls her to her room excitedly.  Charles has retained some of his
straightforward honesty, represented by his pratfall, but he has lost his
cloying passivity and has gained the ability to assert himself.  This
integration is necessary for a happy ending: Charlie must regain the
qualities that Jean loved in him, while tempering them with what Eve and
Jean have taught him.

To understand the Eve/Jean transition, we must step back to the telephone
conversation with Charles's father.  Just as losing control of Charles the
first time was the stimulus for an abrupt and total change in Jean's
behavior, the second loss of control tells Jean that she has somehow erred
again.  However, when Jean became Eve, her actions gave us enough
information to understand her transformation.  The degree to which she
punished Charles can be explained only by the combined shock to Jean the
jilted lover in the film and Jean the director controlling the film.

In the Eve/Jean transition, the plot of the film ends before we work out
her reasons or have a chance to see that she is no longer deceiving
Charles.  We do not see what happens to Jean in the process of changing
her mind, nor do we see anything other than that she apparently wants
Hopsy back.  The only explanation consistent with a happy future for the
couple is that her education is now complete, and that she has integrated
her two selves: not Jean/Eve, but Jean in the movie and Jean controlling
the movie.  On this basis, it seems believable that Jean will no longer
deceive Charles, and that the source of her anger has been identified and
dealt with.

In the final scene, Charles and Jean admit to each other that they are
married, Charles first as is appropriate for his regained honesty.  The door
closes as Jean says, ``But so am I, dear, so am I.'' The door alone is in
the frame for a few seconds, and then the knob slowly begins to turn.  It
could be Charles, unable to deal with the relevation of, from his point of
view, the fused Eve/Jean character.

Instead, though, it is Mugsy who leaves, saying ``Positively the same
dame.''  There is an integration, or perhaps a segregation, here.  Mugsy,
who has represented the cynical, negative aspects so long absent from
Charles's character, gets the last word in the film.  He must leave Jean's
cabin for there to be a happy ending.  But it is unclear whether his
departure signals a tempered absorption of some of the cynical
characteristics he represents, or a rejection of those characteristics.
This confusion is furthered by his name, which could indicate that he is a
``mug,'' a word which Jean and Harry use to describe Charles when they see
him as a mark.  In any case, it appears that Charles has achieved whatever
education and integration is necessary for a happy relationship.

The movie thus ends ambiguously intellectually, but positively
emotionally.
