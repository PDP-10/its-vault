Dear Michael,

Thanks for forwarding me the MIT bill.  I wondered where those things
had got to.  I got my driver's license too, a while back, but I haven't
made any use of it yet, except to pull it out on the unsuspecting and say,
"State o' California, ma'am."

I guess you're still living at the old homestead?

I got some El Cheapo brand postcards to send as Christmas cards.  I've
enclosed one, along with your pig print that I somehow made off with.  The
Kodak people got the color right, as you can see, but it's not on card
stock like I thought.  I'm working on an idea involving peel-away sticky
labels in 3x7...

Not much else is happening.  I just finished my two mid-terms.  I don't
know whether I'll be working in Berkeley this January or not.  I have a
plan whereby I work at Berkeley all next semester, and take one or two
classes there also.  But I may be working here, instead.

See you,
