Clementine
Henry Fonda, Victor Mature, Linda Darnell


Ford is the foremost genre director.  He was immediately recognized as an
artist.  He had made about 30 silent films by 1921.  He was an
action/Western director.  _Clementine_ was produced in the middle of his
career.

In the early 60's he made movies with John Wayne.  In the late 40's,
Calban Trulugsfd? _Ford Apache_, _She Wore a Yellow Ribbon_, _Rio Grande_.
Also Jimmy Stewart, Gary Cooper, Henry Fonda.

What is the nature of the Western?  If the myth didn't fit the fact,
that's OK.  The idea of "The West" was falsified.  _Cheyenne Autumn_
(1964) was his only movie to realistically treat Indians.

The "Western" genre film has three elements: the founding story, the love
story, and the hero/saviour tale.  

. The founding story is about winning against savagry, about creating and
establishing a community and about bringing civilization to the wilderness.

In Ford's films, the founding story receives a patriotic, celebratory,
affirmative treatment.  The immensity of the physical spaces and camera
position in his films show the miniscule scale of human endeavor, and the
transitory nature of human activities.  Many of Ford's films were shot in
Monument Valley, Arizona.  Other filmmakers avoided the area.

. The love story necessarily introduces some tension into the movie.  The
Western's ideas of masculinity and civilization/domesticity are put
head-to-head.  There is generally a rough man involved, sometimes
reluctantly, in romance.  There is sometimes a rival.  For the hero, love
reduces independence.  He must resolve this conflict.  Usually he resolves
it by "riding off into the sunset."  The apparent contradiction between
ideas of masculinity and ideas of c/d is a reflection of a parallel
struggle in American society.

. The hero is responsible in some way for the establishment of the
society or civilization.  There is inevitably a cost to the hero.  The
hero/savior tale celbrates individuality.  There is an intellectual
incoherence in this tale as well; the founding of a community needs the
help of a strong man, a man who feels ambivalent about the resulting
gentleness/feminization.  The hero doesn't feel comfortable in the society
he helped create, and therefore "rides off."  Sometimes he feels nostalgia
for the old world.

A Western, by virtue of being a genre film, must buy into previous films
and the roles that actors have played.  The audience is expected to
understand the conventions and note the deviations from the norm.  In this
way, the movie can express itself subtly.

McCabe and Mrs. Miller turns the conventions of the Western on its head,
or on their heads.  Yet, at the same time it lives by the conventions.

. The love story is between a weak man and a strong woman -- a madam, in
fact.  She knows more about the world than he does.  She is more
masculine.  The love story is shown in a strange light.  "Probably the
only woman I could fall in love with would be a whore," McCabe mutters.

McCabe is trapped into a macho image he can't live up to; he can't take
the advice of a woman (Mrs. Miller), and he dies because of these
failings.  Before he dies, though, he kills all his assailants; he should
have thus "redeemed" himself, but the movie portrays death in the Old West
as an unheroic thing.

. The founding story is on the periphery in _McCabe_.  McCabe moves in and
stimulates the local economy.  At the beginning of the movie, there is
only one building, an unfinished church.  McCabe has a building built.
Mrs. Miller comes in and gets McCabe to put up more money for a bigger
building.  Throughout the movie we see more and better buildings.  There
is no explicit mention of any building, other than the whorehouse and its
attached bathhouse, which McCabe denounces as unnecessary.  Yet, the town
grows up around him, almost mysteriously.  His land holdings are the
immediate cause of his downfall (he refuses to sell them, and is
assassinated).

The church remains unfinished throughout the film.  While McCabe is being
hunted by the killers, the church catches on fire and the townspeople rush
to save it.  There is a tragicomic sequence at the end with cuts between
McCabe and the killers on one hand, and the townspeople on the other.  At
first it's funny, but then it's not, but we still have some "funny" left
over, so it makes the ending unsettling.  The townspeople do put out the
fire, and McCabe does kill his hunters, but he dies (or freezes over) and
Mrs. Miller dissipates in an opium den.

There is, thus, a shootout in the end, but there is no "honor" involved --
people get shot in the back, for instance.  The hero dies.

The minister is shown in a bad light.  He also gets the grossest scene.
(His hand gets shot off, and we see it for just an instant.)  This, and
the unfinished church and the weirdness of the people about it say bad
things about religion (and authority, says Thorburn, but I dinna see it).

_McCabe and Mrs. Miller_ has lots of background noise and overlapping
dialog, to enhance the realism at some cost in understanding.  It rains a
lot.

There are lots of Chinese people in the film, all in labor jobs.  There is
a fairly well-to-do, young black couple in the town.

There's a young boy who gets killed here as in Clementine, but his death
is not the motive for any revenge.  It does set us against the assassins,
if such setting against we needed.  His death is ignominious and
arbitrary.  He lands in icy water.

_The Lady Eve_
Henry Fonda, Barbara Stanwyck

_The Lady Eve_ is a "comedy of remarriage."  It is also a "screwball
comedy."  Howard Hawkins (1896-1977) made 3 classic screwball comedies:
1934: _20th Century_, 1938: _Bringing Up Baby_ (Grant/Hepburn), 
1940: _His Girl Friday_.

Comedies of remarriage call into question the meaning of marriage.  What
sanctifies matrimony?  What about chastity?  

_The Lady Eve_ further calls these questions into question.  The "slimy
snake," which frigntens the woman, shows that although she is
sophisticated, sexuality is still a problem for her.  It used to be the
case that this wouldn't have been an issue.  The fact that the snake is so
obviously a symbol of her difficulties (and just that -- her
difficulties), pokes fun at our acceptance of this new morality.  But it
also shows us that if we're still to have romantic comedies, we need
something to replace virginity.  A "metaphysical loss of innocence" fills
the bill quite handily.  There are two narrative requirements that stem
from this change: 1) that we find romance within marriage itself and 2)
that the couple be able to discuss topics other than the promises of love
(Harry's "whatever it is young people talk about"), such as the facts of
marriage.  [All this is from Stanley Cavell, _Pursuits of Happiness_, p.54].

Comedies of remarriage typically contain not merely philosophical
discussion of marriage, but metaphysical discussions of the concept that
underlines the classic problem of comedy and that of marriage; namely, the
problem of identity, either in the form of what becomes of an individual,
or what has become of two individuals. [Cavell, p.55]



Structure, Dialog, Satire: sexual hypocracy/"innocence", Stanwyck's complexity

After WWII the zany, escapist qualities of screwball comedies became less
important; satire was more important.  "A zany female puts a conventional
male through complicated paces."  American sex comedy.  This film is
slightly post-screwball, in that the acknowledgement of physical
attraction is stronger and that there is an intrusion of unpleasant
reality (Mugsy/Hitler parody).

Singin' in the Rain
Gene Kelly, Stanley Donen, Debby Reynolds

_Singin' in the Rain_ is the culminating MGM "integrated" musical.  It was
imperfect, in that it was artificial and implausible, but there was a
systematic attempt to link the singing and dancing to a setting, a story,
and a psychological state.  This effort is in contrast to Astaire and
Busby Berkeley movies.

The movie is about the silent/sound transition.

Arthur Fried conception.  Songwriter.  He came into power in the late
30's, gathered together a reportory company, and worked with the same
crew/actors/staff to the result of a communal feeling.

Communal activity and shared responsibility for a task are a recurring
theme of musicals.  There's no competition between Kelly and Donen.  They
are supportive of each other.

1. Gentle Satiric Energy -- satire and parody
   parody -- a text which systematically mocks or imitates another text
   prior history of musicals and movies

2. slides into: aware of movies as a cultural artifact
   recapitulation of movie genres: swashbucker/epic
   "audition scene"
   "beautiful girls" b berkeley
      the performance theme
      nature of performance
      making a movie - remaking a movie

   "make 'em laugh" -> keaton, vaudville

3. the place of dance and song
   represent exuberance, individuality, energy
   give expression to our feelings of exuberance
   constraints fall away
   express things ordinary behavior won't allow

speech coaches: meaningless dialog -- implicit high culture snobbery
words lose meaning. dance changes meaning of room -> chaos
upsetting convention.  pleasure comes from our recognition of overcoming
inhibitions, stepping over boundaries

good morning: object and space transformed in answer to spontaneous
decision of dancer: couch->stage
singin' in the rain: ditto lamppost, rain, street, lamppost

final scene: experience dance in unique film way: only 8 cuts???

"idea of transformation" musical: especially clear and naive
expression of american optimism or democratic values
unease about established authority and constrint
speech->song
walk->dance
objects->stage
