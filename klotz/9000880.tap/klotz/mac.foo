Subject: macintosh for sale

My mother is the principal of a Hebrew school and she is looking for a
macintosh she can get cheaply.  I mentioned to her that you are
selling, and she said that I should offer you $500.  I told her that
wasn't enough, but she says that's all she has.  I'll mention to her
that there's an external drive involved and see if she's willing to
pay more.  I don't think she'll care very much about the optical mouse
or the keyboard or fan, so she isn't going to give you any extra money
for those.

Also, the 512K mac is an obsolete machine.... there's no room for
upgrading.
