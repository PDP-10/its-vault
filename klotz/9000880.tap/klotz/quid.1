Thank you for the chocolates.  They arrived some few days ago,
miraculously in full working order.  After a short warming period, I
hastened to sample their delights, when quid marlberg in pleno, I was
confronted with a resplendent array of the fruity wonders.  Whilst a happy
prisoner in this unhappy state, I was unable to behave rationally and I
took the morsel near'st the door without even so much as a glance at the
flavor.  Imagine my delight when, awash the flood of now-dissolving
chocolate, my palate detected that most astringent fruit of my childhood:
Had I perchance chosen a quince?

In short order I indulged myself with the framboise, the kirsh, the pear,
and the exotic ``khioui.''  Fortified with the fortification I found
therein, I curiously found it all my muster to gather up and take respite
among the bedclothes.

You may rest assured that the I enjoyed the remainder in a more restrain,
though no less joyous, fashion.
