 1. ITS OUTPUT BUFFER CODES.

The internal ITS output buffer codes are 8 bits long.
Sty handlers should read them in unit mode only.  To read
more than one at a time, use SIOT with 8-bit bytes.
Real terminals are assumed to be able to receive only
7-bit characters;  for them, codes 0 - 176 are sent as
is;  codes above 176 have 176 subtracted from them and
are escaped by a 177.  200-codes that have following arguments
which can reasonably be zero (%TDMOV, %TDMV0, %TDMV1)
have 1 added to each argument, so that 0 need not be sent.

Note that not all 200-codes are meaningful on all types
of terminals.  Programs outputting them in superimage mode
must be careful to use codes that work on the terminal
they have.

 0 - 177	Characters, to be output as is.
		Normally, only single-spacing graphic characters
		will be sent this way.  Other characters will
		appear if programs output them in image mode.
%TDMOV=200	Move cursor.  followed by 4 bytes of arguments:
		first, the old vertical and horizontal positions
		(these are probably not needed by the sty
		handling program); next, the desired vertical
		and horizontal positions.
		Should not be used on "raw" ttys (%TORAW set),
		though it will work.
%TDMV1==201	Should never be encountered.  If it is, it is
		followed by 2 bytes of args - the desired
		vertical and horizontal positions.
		Should not be used on "raw" ttys (%TORAW set).
%TDEOF==202	Clear rest of line and rest of page.
		Does not move the cursor.
		Does nothing on terminals that aren't selectively
		erasable, even if they are displays.
%TDEOL==203	Clear rest of line
%TDDLF==204	Delete character after cursor, without moving cursor.
%TDMTF==205	Turn off motor (should not come out except on terminets).
%TDMTN==206	Turn on motor (" ").
%TDCRL==207	Crlf.
%TDNOP==210	No-op.
%TDBS==211	Backspace - used only on tty's with %TORAW set.
%TDLF==212	Linefeed -		 (").
%TDRCR==213	Carriage return -	 (").
%TDORS==214	Output reset.  Put in the buffer when a tty
		output reset is done, to inform the sty handling
		program or the terminal.  Should never be sent by
		a program explicitly.
%TDQOT==215	Quote the next character so that it is output to the
		terminal without being interpreted by ITS.
%TDFS==216	Move cursor forward one column.
		This is identical to an appropriate %TDMOV command, and
		exists to increase the efficiency of utilisation of
		space in the output buffer.
%TDMV0==217	Move cursor, followed by 2 args: the desired
		vertical and horizontal positions.
		Should not be used on "raw" ttys (%TORAW set).
%TDCLR==220	Clear the screen, and move the cursor to the top left.
		On printing terminals, it does nothing.
%TDBEL==221	Produce a sound on the terminal, or otherwise try
		to attract the user's attention, without permanently
		altering the contents of the screen.
%TDINI==222	Sent at system start-up to all terminals,
		to tell them to reset themselves.
%TDILP==223	Insert Line Positions.  Followed by a byte containing
		the number of lines to insert.  The current line and
		all lines below it are pushed down on the screen that
		many positions.  Lines pushed off the bottom of the
		screen are lost.  Blank lines appear at the cursor to
		replace the lines shifted downward.  The cursor does
		not move.
		This code and the following one should be used only
		on terminals which have %TOLID set, and only with the
		cursor at the beginning of a line.
%TDDLP==224	Delete Line Positions.  Followed by a byte containing
		the number of positions to delete.  That many lines,
		starting with the current line, disappear.  The lines
		below them are shofted up to take their places.  Blank
		lines are shifted in as necessary at the bottom of the
		screen.  The cursor does not move.
%TDICP==225	Insert Character Positions.  Followed by a byte
		containing the number of spaces to insert.  All of the
		characters on the current line from the cursor to the
		end move that many positions to the right.  The last
		few move off the right margin and disappear.  The
		terminal is not expected to know anything about
		continuation lines.  Spaces are shifted in at the
		cursor to replace the characters that are moving
		right.
		This code and the following one should be used only
		on terminals which have %TOCID set.
%TDDCP==226	Delete Character Positions.  Followed by a byte
		containing the number of character positions to
		delete.  All of the characters to the right of the
		cursor move that many positions left, except for the
		first few, which disappear rather than move past the
		cursor.  Spaces appear at the right margin to replace
		them.
%TDBOW==227	Turns on inverse video mode for characters which are
		output subsequently.  The terminal should use some
		sort of alternate display mode to emphasize them.
%TDRST==230	Turns off inverse video mode.  If any other similar
		modes are created, %TDRST will turn them off too.
