;;;  Table coordinates - physical motion of the mouse
;;;  Mouse coordinates - (only deltas exist here)  These are the table
;;;			 coordinates after (possibly non-linear) scaling.
;;;  Screen coordinates - these are where the mouse-blinker appears on
;;;			 the TV screen; the same as mouse coordinates except

;;; The Scroll-Bar

;;; Moving out the left edge of a window that has a scroll bar causes the
;;; window's mouse handler to call this routine.
;;; While the mouse is inside the scroll bar, the mouse buttons are used
;;; to scroll the window for which the scroll bar was brought up.
;;; You can tell that you are in the scroll bar, because the mouse cursor
;;; changes to a fat doubleheaded arrow and part of the left margin of
;;; of the window is darkened, showing where in the buffer is the visible portion.

;;; The commands in the scroll bar are:
;;;   Left: Move the line next to the mouse to the top.
;;;   Left-double: Move the line next to the mouse to the bottom.
;;;   Right: Move the top line to the place where the mouse is.
;;;   Right-double: Move the bottom line to the place where the mouse is.
;;;		Note that this does not call the system menu as you would
;;;		normally expect.
;;;   Middle: Jump to a place in the "buffer" as far (proportionally) from
;;;	     the beginning as the mouse is from the top.
;;;   Middle-double: not used


;;; The window should handle the :SCROLL-POSITION message by returning these four values:
;;;  TOP-LINE-NUM - the line-number of the line currently at the top of the window
;;;  TOTAL-LINES - the total number of lines available to scroll through.
;;;  LINE-HEIGHT - the height (in pixels) of a line
;;;  N-ITEMS - the number of items displayed on the screen (there are occaisions where
;;;	       this is not trivially calcuable from the other information)
;;; The window should handle the message :SCROLL-TO line-number by scrolling
;;;  to that line, or trying to.  This handler should truncate its arg into range.

;;; A window which can use the scroll bar should send a :NEW-SCROLL-POSITION
;;;  message to itself whenever it scrolls, for any reason, mouse-related or not.
;;; This causes the scroll bar to update its display.
