;Compute the motion that would be caused by outputting a string.
;This is used by the editor.
;Note that this does not use the "case shift" flavor of font hacking.
; Instead, it uses the 16-bit-character flavor that the editor uses.
; This means that if you give it an ordinary 8-bit string it will
; be assumed to be all in font 0.
;*** Actually the code seems to be confused about this. ***
;Args are: sheet, X and Y position to start at (NILs here use the current
; position of the sheet), string, and optionally the starting and ending indices
; and a flag saying to fake a CRLF at end of the string.
; Optionally you can give two additional arguments which are the X and Y to stop at,
; if not given these default to the end of the sheet.
;Returns 3 values: FINAL-X, FINAL-Y, and an indication of how far down the
; string it got.  this is NIL if the whole string (including the fake
; carriage return, if any) was processed without
; reaching the stopping point, or the index of the next character to be
; processed when the stopping point was reached, or T if the stopping point
; was reached after the fake carriage return.
;*** The interface to this crock should be redesigned.  Also note that the
;*** exact treatment of STOP-X and STOP-Y does not agree with SHEET-STRING-LENGTH.
