This directory contains
1) Various DEC programs, which will boot in TS DEC if they are run
2) The files that DEC programs expect on the SYS: device.
if a DEC program opens SYS:, it really looks on this directory.
3) The DEC emulator source(MC only), binary, and pure dump (TS DEC).
4) The DEC bootstrap (DECBOT BIN).  If you have a DEC program in core,
   do $$1L DECSYS;DECBOT BIN<CR> 46$9B   to arrange for the DEC
   program to be ^K'able directly (it will load in and start TS DEC).
   If you created the core image using DECUUO, this is not necessary.
   Use :PDUMP instead of $Y.
