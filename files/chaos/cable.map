The cable propagation speed is estimated at 5 ns/m.  This is consistent
with the reflection measurement when it was first put in.  The transceiver
delay is measured at 220 ns.  Using the 2T rule and a 50% margin for error,
the delay between turns is 700 ns for the transceiver + 15ns/m of cable.
Guessing the TS-campus distance at 700m and the total cable length at 1000m,
and the units of the my-turn counter as 500ns, we have:
	Distance	Number of turns
	0-20m		2
	20-50m		3
	50-80m		4
	80-110m		5
	700m		23	Tech Sq to Campus
	1000m		32	Recycle from end of cable to beginning
We need to make a chart of where hosts are on the cable, to determine
the new host numbers.
