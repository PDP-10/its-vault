 true, but I don't accept the Hypothetical'?"
	"Certainly there might.  He, also, had better take
to football."
	"And neither of these readers," the Tortoise continued,
"is as yet under any logical necessity to accept Z as true?"
	"Quite so," Achilles assented.
	"Well, now, I want you to consider me as a reader of the
second kind, and to force me, logically, to accept Z
as true."
	"A tortoise playing football would be--" Achilles was beginning.
	"--an anomaly, of course," the Tortoise hastily interrupted.
"dont't wander from the point.
Let's have Z first, and football afterwards!"
	"I'm to force you to accept Z, am I?" Achilles said
musingly.
"And your present position is that you accept
A and B, but you dont accept the Hypothetical--"
	"Let's call it C," said the Tortoise.
	"--but you dont accept:
.space
	(C) If A and B are true, Z must be true."
.space
	"That is my present positon," said the Tortoise.
	"Then I must ask you to accept C."
	"I'll do so," said the Tortoise, "as soon as you've entered it
in that note-book of yours.  What else have
you got in it?"
	"Only a few memoranda," said Achilles, nervously fluttering the leaves:
"a few memoranda of--of the battles in which I have distinguished myself!"
	"Plenty of blank leaves, I see!" the Tortoise cheerily remarked.
"We shall need them all!" (Achilles shuddered.) 
"Now write as I dictate:
.space
	(A) Things that are equal to the 
same are equal each other.
	(B) The two sides of this triangle are things that are equal 
to the same.
	(C) If A and B are true, Z must be true.
	(Z) The two sides of this Triangle are equal to each other."
.space
	"You should call it D, not Z," said Achilles.
"It comes next to the other three.  If you accept A and B and C,
you must accept Z."
	"And why must I?"
	"Because it follows logically from them.
If A and B and C are true, Z must be true.
You don't dispute that, I imagine?"
	"If A and B and C are true, Z must be true," the 
Tortoise thoughtfully repeated.
"That's another Hypothetical isn't it?
And, if I failed to see its truth, I might 
accept A and B and C, and still not accept Z,
mightn't I?"
	"You might," the candid hero admitted; "though such obtuseness would
certainly be pheno
