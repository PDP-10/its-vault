Subject: Trademarking EMACS
To: tops-20@SU-SCORE.ARPA, bug-emacs@MIT-MC.ARPA, info-emacs@CMU-CS-C.ARPA

There was recently some discussion on the Tops-20 mailing list (and I
think maybe some others as well) about ads from Unipress that have shown
EMACS as a trademark.  Since I had more confidence than some of you in
the sanity of the folks at Unipress, I decided to check with them to
find out what is going on.  The following response is from Mike
Gallaher, one of the EMACS technical support staff.  It was written in
consultation with the president of Unipress.

			------------------

Unipress is NOT trying to claim the name "EMACS" as a trademark.  We
do claim the names "Unipress Emacs" and "Gosling Emacs" as
trademarks, which we have done for three or four months now.  For a
period of about two months, between April and June, we did
ill-advisedly place the TM device on the name Emacs.  Because of the
lead time for magazine ads, the ads with Emacs(tm) just appeared in
the last two or three issues of BYTE.  

Originally, our ads simply used the word EMACS, with no TM.  We
received many threatening letters and phone calls from several LARGE
computer companies who claimed that they owned the name EMACS and
that we could not use it.  The use of TM on the name EMACS was a
hasty action to defend ourselves from such threats.  

After realizing that it is absurd to trademark the name EMACS,
because it has really become a name for a generic class of editors
(as Mark Crispin noted), and to avoid conflicts with trademarks
like "CCA EMACS", we decided to claim the phrases "Unipress Emacs"
and "Gosling Emacs" instead.

Our reason for claiming a trademark in the first place was in
self-defense.  We certainly have no intention of keeping anyone from
using the name Emacs for any program, public-domain or otherwise.

I think it is quite unlikely that that trademark would stand up in court.
The original meaning of "EMACS" became lost once the EMACS interface was
implemented in other than TECO on a PDP-10, and has since come to mean a
generic class of display editors with certain characteristics.  This is
precisely the sort of thing which keeps a name from being a trademark --
in the USA "Asprin" lost its trademark status and great lengths are gone
to protect "Kleenex" and "Xerox" from becoming generic names for tissues
and copying machines respectively.

Because of this, even RMS couldn't trademark the name EMACS (assuming he
wanted to) any more.

The question is, who is going to sue Unipress?  I suspect it'll be one
of the other companies which have proprietary versions of EMACS.  A pity,
because Unipress ought to be hit for a nice amount in $$ for damages
(restraint in trade, etc.) and it'd be nice if the people who worked on
PDP-10 EMACS got it...

    I dearly wish that some public-spirited person would give Dired

    /phil

CCA EMACS does this by having a Dired Mode (a Major Mode) for buffers.
With ITS EMACS it's hard because Dired is a Subsystem, which takes over
completely, and runs inside a recursive ^R loop.  It would take just a
little bit of hacking to make this happen.  I'm not sure about the overhead
for all the local variables, though.  I don't know if that was the reason
it was done as by hand instead of as a major mode.

What about Info and Babyl and so on?

I don't know how I missed this, but since the August issue of BYTE,
UNIPRESS is claiming a trademark on EMACS in their ads.  I say
"claiming" because the first requirement to be able to register a
trademark is to have claimed the trademark associated with a product

unchallenged, I suspect we may be forced to give up using the name
EMACS, as absurd as it sounds...

Subject: Ambassador terminals
To: bug-emacs@SU-SCORE.ARPA


I use an ambassador terminal, and among other things, I run a status line
on the 60th line.  To do this, I define the bottom line as a Lower Host 
Area, using the escape sequence ESC[60;;1p  

When I start up emacs, it automagically sends the sequence ESC[x;;;xp
, where 'x' is the line length (apparently as obtained from the exec).
This unfortunately, wipes out my status line.  It also seems that it
sends this sequence twice, for no apparent reason.

I have written an Ambassador library myself, which among other things
sets up the function keys, and places default defnintions on them.
I could just add a line which output the screen size I wanted, but 
that would be less than optimal.

This seems to be because, when & Spell Replace Word looks through the
file returned by the spell checker, it uses the word commands like "fwl"
to pick out the suggested spellings.  The ..D delimiter table seems to
indicate single quote as a delimiter, so it just picks out "simplicity"
from the word "simplicity's" that is actually in the file.  It seems that
& Spell Replace Word should set up a temporary ..D that has single quote
as a letter.  Is someone able to fix this?  I haven't munged EMACS for
so long I would not feel qualified to do this reliably.

There are two types of H1500 terminals: ones that use ESC as a leadin character
for cursor commands, and ones that use a tilde as a leadin character.
The H1500 that is supported by the -20 uses tilde.  You should be able to
set switches, jumpers, whatever, on your terminal to make it use tilde instead
of ESC.  Another thing you might try is the ESPRIT terminal type -- I am not
sure if that works correctly with the H1500 but it is worth a try.

Subject: Emacs problem solved!
To: bug-emacs@SU-SCORE.ARPA

In reference to a BBoard posted that complained about SCORE-Emacs being too
slow even when the load was very low:

I just  found out  what the  problem was.   What happened  to me  was  than
whenever I typed a command  that would reposition the  page (^O, or ^K  for
example) the terminal would  freeze for about 10-15  seconds.  Of course  I
blamed this on the  system being slow.  But  what really happened was  that
Score either sent a whole series of null characters, or a string of control
characters that effectively froze up  the terminal.  I made this  discovery
by observing the CHAR-RECEIVE LED on my MODEM.

After much searching I isolated the following line in my Emacs.INIT file:

!* If the System doen't know what Baud Rate the terminal is using, !
!* set it to 1200 baud to avoid excessive padding. !

@:I*| 2 FS Echo Lines FS OSpeed"E 1200 FS OSpeed' | FS TTY Macro
FS TTY Init

I really don't have the foggiest idea  what TECO is all about.  I got  this
line straight from the LEDIT init file at CMU!  But just in case some other
poor slob is complaining, you will know what to tell them.  --Shawn

    I'd think it would be easier to get the source for the terminal emulator

This is probably the thing to do, because:

    Unless someone wants to hack this into the exec like they did 
    ter reverse (delete and underscore characters).

There's more to doing this than hacking the Exec.  The Monitor also
has to be hacked (as it is in TERM REVERSE (DELETE AND UNDERSCORE)).
It's not that much code, but it's not very pretty either.  Also,
if we started doing this for lots of pairs of keys, the nomenclature
would kill us.  Would you like to see this?

@TERM REV ? one of the following:
 COLON-DQUOTE		CONTROL-C-CONTROL-Z		DELETE-UNDERSCORE
 ESCAPE-BACKQUOTE

No, neither would I.

which this keyboard doesn't have...

Unfortunately, however, it's not easy to do.  You could change the
definition of escape to insert a backquote and change backquote to be the
^R Prefix Meta.  You could also change Search Exit Char to backquote, but
it wouldn't do any good since I-Search seems to think it has to be a
control key instead of looking at the definition of the key.

Also, anywhere else that wants an escape (like babyl, teco minibuffers for
M-%, etc) won't work.  It's just hardwired in in too many places.

I'd think it would be easier to get the source for the terminal emulator

Subject: saving and recalling emacs keyboard macros
To: bug-emacs@MIT-XX.ARPA

I have had trouble recalling EMACS keyboard macros.  I have bee following
the directions in the manual (I think), nameing the macro with Name Kbd Macro, 
writing it with Write Kbd Macro; and then trying to reload it in another
incarnation of EMACS with Load Library.  As far as I can tell, the macro
does get into the library (it's there when I list it), but I can't invoke
it either as a M-X function or bound to a key.

I have seen other people do it, with (apparently) the same set of commands,
on their own EMACSs.

Thanks.

To: bug-emacs@SU-SCORE.ARPA

When I use the heath library I occasionally get "x"s or "r"s when I move
through the file using the <uparrow> or <downarrow> on the numeric keypad.
It seems to happen whenever I do about 4 or 5 in rapid succession.  The
extra characters are usually accompanied by a beep.  I have not noticed the 
problem when I use the ctrl-p or ctrl-n keys directly.  Is there a way to
fix the problem?  Is the problem in the tips?  In the Heath library?

I would like to be able to do the following
task in emacs. Please tell me if there is an easy
way to do this. If there is not an enasy way to
do this, it would be nice if someone would
fix emacs to give it this capability.

desired task:
I would like to be able 
1) to assign names to sequennces of emacs commands (OK)
2) to execute such keyboard macros (OK)
3) to save such keyboard macros
4) to have my emacs init file read in my keyboard macros

Furthermore, I DO NOT want to have to use teco or
have to know anything about teco.
It would be nice if emacs provided keyboard macros
facilities with the same high level interface
that is provided for word abbreviations.

Also, it would be nice if emacs had better programming
primitives (conditionals, numeric operators, variables)
for use in keyboard macros.

Any decent text editor should provide these
fundamental building blocks for
creating new editing commands.

    I'm running a terminal program on my Apple that emulated a VT52 with 
    line/character insert/delete, using $L, $M, $P, $Q, and $R for insert
    line, delete line, delete character, enter insert mode, and exit insert 
    mode, respectivly. I use
    :tctyp vt52 +%tolid +%tocid  .....
    :tctyp<cr> gets:
    VT52, Padtab=1, +%tocid, +%tolid, Query
    I did not specify the padtab. I tried :tctyp padtab 0<cr>, and restarting 
    emacs, and now it uses a series of $C's instead of spaces. When I type
    a tab, it then goes to the right with $C's, too. 

On display terminals the PADTAB field is recycled to control cursor
positioning options rather than padding for tabs (only printing
terminals need padding for tabulation.)  Unfortunately TCTYP doesn't
know to print the field with a type-dependent name.

Part of what's happening to you is that ITS is smart and compensates for
the numerous bugs in (some) VT52s having to do with cursor positioning.
The value of PADTAB you want might be 3, I don't remember for sure.

	You might pass this on to MIT, but I have found that when one is
editing a narrowed region of a file, such as narrowing the region to a single
page and that region has no CRLF at its end, that EMACS prompts you: The file
does not end with CRLF should I add one when you write the file out.  It 
does this even if the FILE itself does end with a carriage return line feed.
Apparently EMACS is just looking at the narrowed region for the terminal 
CRLF and it should look at the file as a whole.  Indeed, if you respond Yes,
to add a CRLF, EMACS adds one at the end of the region rather than at the 
end of the file.

	I think this is a BUG because most people editing narrow regions
are usuallyediting PAGES of a manuscript (at least I am) and these regions
are almost always followed immediately by CRLF-FORMFEED, hence there is no
reason to add a CRLF to the end of the narrowed region. I think that
the check for  a terminal CRLF should look at the file as a whole, even if
the user is only editing a narrowed region.

Get a multi-screenful file into a buffer, go to the end, do C-5 C-L
then use C-X D to get into Dired, then use Q to exit it.  The screen,
under all conditions I've tested anyway, will be as if C-L'ed, with
the point in the middle rather than on the 5th line like it was before

words such as "Find", "Blank" or "Line"] in the

Why is there such limited access to blanklines?

I'm running a terminal program on my Apple that emulated a VT52 with 
line/character insert/delete, using $L, $M, $P, $Q, and $R for insert
line, delete line, delete character, enter insert mode, and exit insert 
mode, respectivly. I use
:tctyp vt52 +%tolid +%tocid 
...It's got 80 columns by 24 lines... Now, the problem: it seems to like
to use relative cursor motion instead of absolute, and in Emacs, when I do 
something that moves the cursor forward several columns, it moves it by
printing spaces, which wipes out what is on the screen between where the 
cursor starts and ends up. I am typing to MAIL right now, and when a line
exceeds the screen width, and wraps around with a ! in the right column,
and I ^W the word that made it wrap, the cursor first erases the end
of the word on the line it's on with a series of <bs><sp><bs>'s, then
spaces out to the right side of the screen on that same line, moves up, and 
erases the rest of the word with <bs><sp><bs>'s. This is quite annoying at
300 baud... I have never had this problem until recently. It seems to
have started within the last several days, although I have not used this
terminal program for a month or two. I have always had the same problem
when I specify :tctyp hp , which gets the line/char ins/del codes right,
but uses relative cursor motion all the time. (could have something to
do with the god awful absolute cursor motion sequences of the hp.)
In Emacs, after, say, refreshing the screen, the cursor is moved to
where the point is in the file with an $H for home, a series of spaces, and a 
series of ^J's. I have yet to see an $Y for absolute cursor motion.
:tctyp<cr> gets:
VT52, Padtab=1, +%tocid, +%tolid, Query
I did not specify the padtab. I tried :tctyp padtab 0<cr>, and restarting 
emacs, and now it uses a series of $C's instead of spaces. When I type
a tab, it then goes to the right with $C's, too. 

Oh, sigh, I hope I've been concise enough...

We are trying to use EMACS when logged into EECS with a PC/XT running UNIX.
We are using the canned CONNECT program, and do not have the option of 
easily changing our terminal characteristics. It is quite inconvenient to 
reboot PC-DOS in order to run KERMIT or an H-19 emulator. We are not with 
ATHENA. 
	The VT100 terminal type almost works. We would like to add the 
IBMPC type to whatever table EMACS uses to decide what it is talking to.
By way of example, if we were talking to a UNIX system, we would add a 
suitable termcap or terminfo entry. Can this be done for the EMACS which 
runs on EECS? That is, can we define a new terminal type which EMACS could 
use to talk to us?

Subject: need help with Ungermann-Bass interface!

Date: Wednesday, 29 August 1984  15:04-PDT
From: SLOAN

 I'm back again, with another problem...
 His office terminal connects to the outside world (including Ward) via
an Ungerman-Bass box which interprets several control characters for its
own purposes - making them inconvenient to type.  In particular:

	Character	Meaning
	 ^S, ^Q		Flow control between terminal and U-B,
			NOT passed through to Ward
	 ^T CR		Hang up.  The U-B HOLDS the ^T until
			it sees the next character; if it IS NOT
			CR, then both ^T and CR are sent.
	 ^P		Datalink escape.  Any character treated
			specially can be quoted by ^P.
 That's all I've discovered so far.  Also, this isn't quite right,
since we could not reliably get a ^S to Ward (using ^P^S.); similarly
for ^Q.
 So, the bottom line is: {^P,^Q,^S,^T,...?} are unusable.  This is
bad, but perhaps there is a work-around?  Immediate problems:
	1) When typeout longer than 1 page go from Ward to the
	   terminal, output stops at the page break - waiting for the
	   ^Q we can't type.  Current fix: set the page length to 0
	   and try to read fast.  Can we do better?

	2) EMACS is a disaster without {^P,^Q,^S,^T}.  Can you advise
	   on how to bind a different set of keys to get their
	   effects?  Note that we really need substitutes for these
	   keys in every context (the fun started when he asked me how
	   to save a file he was editting, and I said "^X^S" - guess
	   what happened?)
 All help appreciated.

I'll theorize that HSNAME: only contributed to this problem by being slow

Subject: Crash when directory full
To: BUG-emacs@MIT-OZ


It seems that LEDIT/EMACS dies when the directory one is working with 
gets full.  Lisp gives nasty messages regarding its subprocess LEDIT
in this case, and there seems to be no way to recover the editor.
Since the latest changes are not written out in the process, work may
be lost.  Expunging files does not help, the LISP to EMACS connection
is garbled permanently.

To: BUG-EMACS @ MIT-MC

I would like to inquire why emacs does something the way it does.
Suppose I am working on an 80-column terminal.  If I have a line which is 
exactly 80 characters long, it could be displayed all on one line.
However, instead emacs puts a ! in column 80 an the last character on the
next line.  This is annoying when editting a file containing many lines
of exactly 80 columns.  I would think the right way to do it would be to
put character 80 at the end of the line, then if I type in an 81st
character, put in the ! and move 80 and 81 to the next line.

While using Pascal mode, if I use <LF> at the end of a line containing
balanced parentheses to auto-indent the next line, I get the error msg:

UTC Unterminated Conditional?

and the next line is not indented.  Auto-indentation works normally if
there is a extra ')' on the line (but the compiler finds this
unacceptable).

The problem occurs whether or not I use my emacs.vars file.  I do not have
an emacs.init file.

(I reported this a couple of weeks ago with no apparent response.  Is the

C-U C-X M should get you back into the *Mail* buffer even
if you left it with C-X B rather than with C-].  Presently
it says "You are already in the process of sending mail?".

Multiple mail buffers would be nice; I often want to send
mail while composing mail in a mail buffer.  They could
be called *Mail1* or something.  Seems reasonable if you
can use buffer moving commands to move amongst them.

Used to be that C-X M smashed any existing mail buffer.

Using the modeline library, if you have a long directory name, the
filename can disappear outside the window it has to fit in.  Zmacs
solves this problem by displaying the filename first, a space, and then
the directory name.  This would be featuroidal.

When I use <LF> at the end of a statement to auto-indent the next

jumps to the first '(' with the error msg:
	UTC Unterminated conditional? 
 at the top of the window.  A new line is inserted, but not indented.
When I type the ')', the cursor momentarily jumps to the correct '('
as it should.  I was able to get rid of the UTC msg by typing an extra
')'.  However, the compiler does not like this!
   This did not happen when I last used Pascal mode, some days ago.
Removing my emacs.vars file made no difference.  I have no emacs.init file.

    make a change in FOO.TXT
    get out with ^Z^Z, thus forcing an auto save

    do M-X Revert File

Then the version number for FOO.TXT in the mode line will not be 69 as
it should be, but will be FOO.TXT.1 (or whatever the version number of
the auto-save file was).

This confuses numerous parts of Emacs, so I generally have to kill the
buffer and read the file in again.

Sam,
     I tried editing my directory <WHITNEY.ACCENT> from within EMACS.
When I gave the command to update the directory, most of the files
could not be deleted because they were offline.  The problem was that
all of these files were given a JFN.  The result was that I could not
run many of the EXEC routines.  Finnaly I stumbled on the close
command and was able to clear most of the JFNs.  There were some that
remained.  Did I use the directory editor incorrectly??

Thanks.  As long as I have your attention, there is something I have
always wished I knew how to do - maybe you know.  Has anyone ever
figured out how to make tabs behave like motion commands instead of
insert commands?  (just moving the cursor to the next tab stop instead
of adding a bunch of spaces).  Ideally, they would behave like motion
commands if one were in the middle of a line, but like space-inserting
commands if one were at the end of the text on a line.  This would be a

The user is editing mail to send, in the *Mail* buffer, and turns on
Auto Save Mode.  The autosave filenames chosen are
[SAVE].*MAIL*.0.  The asterisks, however, cause
invalid-wildcard-designator errors.  They need to be quoted with

Well, you also need to catch the [System Expunge Completed] messages
and such.  I think these are the most difficult, since they require
the Twenex site to incorporate changes into the monitor.

In-Reply-To: The message of 24 April 1984 23:38-EST from Pandora B. Berman <CENT @ MIT-MC>

At a recent DECUS, it was suggested that there be a way to trap
messages sent by the system, so that a user program could do whatever
it wanted with them.  DEC was relatively receptive, but I doubt whether
this will ever actually come to exist, given DECs 20 decisions.

Even if this were done, the mailer, and the user SEND program dont
use that form of SENDing to a terminal  anyway.  theoretically, it
would be possible to have EMACS trap SENDs now.  All it would take
is modifications to TECO, SNDSRV, and MMAILR...  Any Volunteers?

When in emacs and a send comes through, the result is a jumble of
characters on the screen.  Would it be possible to have the exec clear
the screen in this case? That would make it far easier to read the
incoming message. (Or would that cause far more problems than
it creates?)

To: EMACS-HACKERS%MIT-OZ@MIT-MC.ARPA

There are several system programs that call up EMACS as a sub-fork
(MM, LISP, and WATSON come to mind as examples).  Is there any way to
get these programs to use an existing EMACS fork instead of calling up
a new one?  This would save a lot of waiting around when the load is
high and also save the system a bit of work and core if it could use
the existing copy instead of making a new one.

Thanks,

	Our EMACS seems to have developed a strange problem lately that
nobody can explain (there are no apparent software changes):

	Over an Interlisp-D CHAT connection, EMACS is not responding to
cursor positioning commands sent by the mouse.  For example, the mouse
would say C-U 4 C-F and the cursor would just stay still.  If you
refresh the screen with a ^L you *will* find the cursor in the correct

 (1) Use full name of file always, so EMACS doesn't get confused
 (3) Add /GOTO: switch to go to a specific character in a file
     (for programs like TeX to use to go to error locations)
 (2) Reuse old EMACS fork even if given a new filename, using FS SUPERIOR.

Contrary to what I said in the previous two messages, this should require
no changes to EMACS itself.  A SRCCOM of EXECED.MAC is available in
<ANONYMOUS>EXECED.DIF on Sierra; you will also need to add GOTOR as a
global somewhere (I did it in EXECGL).  I don't think this relies

Problem:
	Syntax for FS SUPERIOR and normal JCL are different.

       J :S,"N .(ZJJI),Z@FX1 -D' !* IF LOCATION TO GO TO, ADD IT TO Q1!

	A better solution would also put the escape code in FS SUPERIOR,
	or make a common routine for them both to call.

In case you are wondering why I care about all of this, I am working
on the EXEC EDIT command so that it uses FS SUPERIOR if you ask to
edit a file and you already have an EMACS fork, and to have a switch
so that you can type

@EDIT /GOTO:123 FILE

and be put at character 123 of the file (this would be for programs
such as TeX that like to put you in the editor at the position of an error).

I have seen someone (Dan Brotsky) with his EMACS customized to

(respectively).  The cursor is then left between the () to allow text
to be inserted.  Dan does this in his own macro file (which has other
features that I don't want and I can't figure it out anyway) and I
believe that other people have this in INIT files.

Can anyone help me get the appropriate code to generate the matching
delimiters?  I would like it for (), {}, and [].  I would also like it
for matching $$ if I can hook it to only happen in TEX mode.  If these
can not be hooked into TEX and LISP modes only, then I can live with
the keys always defined in this manner.

It seems to me that this feature would be handy to have in an EMACS
library--I would think that several people would use it if available.

While I was at it, I made some changes to TTYSRV to make short
string output to terminal more efficient.  The patches have

effects.  The changes to EMACS are less well debugged, but
seem to work for the most part....  I have not done any
performance measurements to figure out how much this has
helped, but it seems that it ought to do quite a bit...

Interested parties may FTP the following files from the EMACS
directory on SRI-KL:

	TECO.DIF	SRCCOM of the new TECO with the standard MIT
			TECO.MID.1209.  TECO.MID.1237 is the updated
			source code....

PS:  This should serve as an example: people have been suggesting
     changes such as this for a long time, but nothing had ever
     been done.  I had assumed that this was because it had been

    It looks probable that Teco is considering all macro frames to be live,
    rather checking to see if they really are.

Your guess is right.

To do it your way, you can change GCC2 to chain through the macro pdl
list starting with what's in MACPTR and following by way of MFLINK.
Something like (untested of course):
GCC1:	MOVE T,MACPTR
GCC2:	MOVEI T,MFCSTR(T)	;POINT TO CSTR
	SKIPE (T)
	 CALL GCMA
	ADDI T,MFARG1-MFCSTR
	CALL GCM	;MARK MACRO ARG 1 (MAY BE A STRING POINTER)
	ADDI T,MFARG2-MFARG1
	CALL GCM	;MARK MACRO ARG 2
	SKIPE T,MFLINK-MFARG2(T)
	 JRST GCC2

Probably an easier solution is to have FLSFRM do SETZM MFCPTR+1(A), so
that the (now dead) frame doesn't point to the string at all.

In-reply-to: Msg of Sat 10 Mar 84 04:52:36-PST from Ethan Bradford <BRADFORD at SU-SIERRA.ARPA>

I recomend the following low-level algorithm for updating marks:
The list of marks is kept as a sorted list of real buffer offsets
(i.e. include the size of the gap when they're above it).  The
position of gap in the mark list is maintained.  The only mark
updating ever required is when the gap is moved, and when the gap
is widened.  In both cases the work required is proportional to
the number of marks in the characters moved/deleted.

For an implementation of this algorithm in Lisp, see

Subject: GC not reclaiming impure strings held by macro frames
To: BUG-TECO @ MIT-MC
cc: BUG-EMACS @ MIT-MC, BUG-NEX @ MIT-MC

This message records a discussion I had with RMS regarding a 
probable bug in the Teco GC relating to impure strings held by 
inactive macro frame pointers.

I have a Teco init file for dumping an Emacs which does some setup, 
then does:

  er  @y fsrgetty"n@' ftAttempting to macro buffer... :m(hfx*)'

The start file which gets loaded is very large (about 5K) and does

  :m(@:i*| -1f? ei@ejw@ft
  Dumped to N
  0fsechoactivew164000.fs exit|)

at the end of it so that the 5K string can get reclaimed by the -f?

Unfortunately, if I read the resulting BIN file into an editor and 
search for the 5K start file, I find that the string is still present
and not getting GC'd.

From DDT, did searching for the ASCII text of the start file and
found the rubout leading off that string to be in the first char of
47440(8) Given that QRBUF holds 277306(8), I computed the string 
pointer as -34359735078(10), which Teco recognizes as a valid string
pointer and g(-34359735078) seems to yank my start file so I'm sure
I'm looking at the right object.

Using W from DDT again, I determined that the only locations pointing
to -34359735078(10) are MFSTRT+20, MFSTRT+27, MFSTRT+36, and MFSTRT+54,
so it looks to me like it's Teco internals that is holding onto the
only pointer to this.

It looks probable that Teco is considering all macro frames to be live,
rather checking to see if they really are.

For now I will attempt to kludge around this by making my start file into
a library and just not :EJ'ing it upon startup after dump, but if someone
who knows enough to fix this bug for real could do so, I would 
greatly appreciate it.

Thanks, -kmp

Subject: Journal Files

I have been trying to use the JOURNAL library to keep records of my
keyboard interactions so I can analyze what character sequences I most
often type while editing.

Unfortunately, the library doesn't seem to work as advertised.  It is
claimed in the EMACS manual that the journal file is updated every 50
characters.  As far as I can tell, this is completely untrue.  The
output file is created, empty, and NEVER is any information written in
it unless M-X End Journal File is invoked.

Does anyone know anything about this that I don't?  Is there some
aspect of the operation that I have overlooked, or is the library just
broken?  I really want to get records of my editing sessions to
analyze.

Subject: Updating marks in EMACS.
To: bug-emacs@MIT-MC.ARPA

I have made fixes to TECO and EMACS to implement marks which are updated
for changes before them in the buffer.  Here is a copy of my announcement
of the release locally:

    We have put up a new version of EMACS on SIERRA.  This is a test
    release and it is not yet available on the other DEC-20's.

    The new release implements marks which (1) are automatically updated
    for changes in the buffer (standard TECO marks are screwed up if you
    insert or delete characters before them in the buffer) and (2) are
    specific to one buffer (thus setting an updating mark in one buffer
    will not mess up the mark stack in other buffers).  The useful
    functions are in the library MARKER; to get them you must give the
    command M-X Load Library$MARKER .  When you load MARKER you will find
    C-@ set to the function M-X ^R Set/Pop Updating Mark$ and C-X C-X set
    to the function M-X ^R Exchange Point and Updating Mark$.  These will
    work pretty much like the old C-@ and C-X C-X.  If you kill the
    library, the old definitions will be restored.

    You will have to be aware, when you use this package, that currently
    all the other functions in the system use the old, TECO marks.  This
    is fine for functions which just read the mark because ^@ and ^X^X
    will still set the TECO mark; otherwise, use ^U^X^X to make the
    updating mark match the TECO mark.

    Other useful new functions are M-X Make Marker$ and M-X Access
    Marker$, which respectively save and access a marker stored in a
    single letter variable (which you will provide).

    Suggestions and bug reports should be sent to Ethan Bradford
    (BRADFORD@SIERRA).

(If you want to look at any of the files, SIERRA keeps its EMACS files in
the directory <EMACS162> (or use EMACS: instead of a directory name) and 
Sierra supports the anonymous FTP login (i.e. login as ANONYMOUS with
password GUEST from FTP).

The main reason I'm sending this message is that I need help in deciding
how thoroughly the changes should be integrated with the rest of EMACS.

In the current implementation, the MIDAS code for TECO just keeps a list
(in a buffer) of the changes made and the TECO code for EMACS uses that
list to update the markers when they are referenced.  I have these EMACS
functions in a seperate library which the user must load to get the
updating marks.  When this library is loaded, I bind C-X C-X and C-@.  This
has the problem that the user must keep track of whether the point he wants
is marked with a TECO mark or an updating mark and he must know which kind
of mark he needs for his next operation.

A second solution would be to integrate the changes with all the most common
functions in EMACS and leave the more obscure functions alone -- this would
cause occasional glitches for the user, so I don't recommend it.

A third solution would be to replace all calls to ^V (or to redefine ^V).
This would would be needlessly inefficient and it could lead to errors if a
function relies on the mark not being updated (for instance, it might
adjust for the changes itself).

Perhaps the best solution, and the one requiring the most work, would be to
search all EMACS libraries and replace those calls to ^V which have
external effects.  If we did this massive integration of the updating
marks, we would probably want to rewrite some of the TECO algorithms into
MIDAS for efficiency -- perhaps we could allow ^V to keep its definition
and add @^V to mean "^V on the updating mark stack."

Does anybody have any suggestions?  Should we just implement the first
option for a while and see what seems best over the long run?  Comments to
Bradford%SIERRA@SCORE.

Highlighting can't easily be done for the region in EMACS.  Remember, though,
that marks in EMACS are different from marks in Zwei.  In EMACS, there is
a stack of marks.  In Zwei, there is one mark and a stack of points.
There is always a current region in EMACS, but not always one in Zwei.  So
if someone did modify the redisplay routine in TECO (written in PDP-10
code) there would almost always be some reverse-video portion of the
screen.

You can use the TMACS library M-X Graph Buffer command to get a graph
of what the buffer looks like.  Do M-X Load Library$TMACS first.

You can also use ^X-^X to exchange the point and the mark just before
you do M-W or such operations.  It will show you clearly what the
region is.

Is there a way to get emacs to highlight or underline the region between
point and mark on terminals that can support underlining or highlighting
of some sort?

I am constantly getting confused about where my region is because i cant
see it.  Ive gotten used to the underline feature in zwei.  Can that be
done easily in emacs?

As a related question, the above would only make sense if there is a way
to distinguish intentionaly made marks (C-space) from others.  I often
loose when i try to set the mark with C-space and then do C-M-N's to
move over several expressions and then do M-W only to get just the last
s-expression I moved over.  Is there any way to distinguish marks made
by C-space and restrict commands like C-W etc to use them?

To: bug-emacs@MIT-XX.ARPA, bug-teco@MIT-XX.ARPA

This concerns people who are running TENEX EMACS on FOONLY or 2020
processors...

TECO currently executes code in the ACs in order to try to make
a string copy loop faster (on KA and KI processors, this was
probably a good idea).  On a KL processor with Cache memory,
this probably makes little difference.  On a Foonly computer,
and presumably on a 2020, since the technology involved is
similar, this is a VERY BAD idea.  The relevant code has been
shown to run 10 to 15 times SLOWER in the ACs of a foonly F4
than the same code run from memory.  There are technical reasons
for this, but the bottom line is that unless you have a KA or KI,
the string copy loop should be left in memory.

I have not made the actual patches.  the relevant portions of code
are near YANK3 and PCHF2

Enjoy

    I've modified tops20 TEXTI not to echo break characters, and for the
    most part, things seem to work.  The exception is that if DISPLAY
    MATCHING PAREN is non-zero, and I include a paren in my typing, the
    cursor moves back to the open paren, but does not return to the end of
    line when I type the next character (unless it is a break character).
    Is the TWENEX code for display matching paren different from the the
    ITS code in the assumptions that it make about whether the cursor
    needs to be moved ?

No, the code is the same.  Are you getting the code at RRECI2 that makes
close paren a break character if FS^RPAREN is set?  I'd think that's all
you need.  You're saying that the cursor is frozen at the left-paren,
right?

			 I would also like someone to explain the places
    that ITS TECO checks for whether the system was doing and ECHOIN call.

Let's see, the label in question is RRECI7.

TSINTA isn't relevant, that's for %PJATY, which Tops-20 doesn't have.

TSINTC is for the clock interrupt.  You want to do the same thing at the
Tops-20 TSINTC, namely get the TEXTI to return so that the normal TYI
routine will process it.

TSINT8 is ^G.  The corresponding code is at TSINT3.  It should interrupt
the TEXTI) Cleaning up may be slightly more difficult, since Tops-20
doesn't have PCLSR'ing, but instead interrupt PC's in monitor mode.

If this isn't enough to go on, and someone has a system setup someplace
with all this new stuff, I'd be happy to look at it as my time permits.

This sounds excellent.  Perhaps Mike McMahon can be cajoled into giving some
advice on the matching paren problem.

Does the modified TEXTI work even if you redefine keys in EMACS, like making
alphabetic keys be bound to functions?  A special example of this is auto
fill mode, which ITS handles specially so that the space key echoes until
it gets to the fill column, at which point it becomes a break character.

Please explain how we can go about modifying our monitor.  I'm interested
in running it here and seeing how it affects the load, but I'll have to
get someone here to install the changed ECHOIN.

Try ^R Kbd Macro Query.  It's on ^X-Q after you've defined or loaded
a keyboard macro.

I proposed a command similar to Meta-M (Meta-Return, etc.) that would
go to the code at the end of the line, but couldn't figure out a good
key to put it on.  Obviously, though, ^E should stand.

Compare Windows malfunctions if you try to compare two sections of the
same buffer, one in each window.  Apparently it uses the same pointer for
both windows, merrily (and sloooowly) running all the way to the end of
the file, and then erroneously proclaiming a match.

    Does it strike anybody as annoying that control-E takes you to

Well, it's a half-good idea, at least.  I just put the following
into my LISPM-INIT.  I wouldn't want to change what c-E does, since
it's so fundamental (and symetric with c-A).  I made the analogy be
with m-;, m-N, and m-P, for s-;, s-N, and s-P.

You could easily change this to check your current position, and move to
the end of the line if you're already at the position determined here.

    than just the end of the final s-expr on the line?  I know I sure

Personally, I couldn't do without this functionality.  My Lispm-Init
loads the following nifty function, by JWalker:
    
    zwei:
    (defcom COM-END-OF-CODE-LINE
	    "Goes to the end of the last /"real/" character on the line.
    This provides a way to get positioned on a line so you can add to or modify
    the code, not the comment.  A numeric argument specifies how many lines to move.  
    I don't see how people live without this.  Maybe if you never comment your code
    you don't notice that this is missing.  " ()
      (let* ((the-line (bp-line (forward-line (point)	;find the line wanted
					      (if *numeric-arg-p* *numeric-arg* 0))))
	     (index (find-comment-start the-line t)))	;index for comment
	(cond ((null index)				;no comment on line
	       (move-to-bp (end-line (create-bp the-line 0))))	;so just go to end
	      (t
	       (move-to-bp (backward-over *blanks* (create-bp the-line index))))))
      dis-bps)

My init file does a login binding of this function to s-E, which isn't
quite kosher, but has mnemonic value.

    How about a control-E that takes you to the end of the final bit
    of CODE on the line, then, if another control-E is done, you can
    access the end of the comment text?

c-E is very strongly entrenched in all modes as meaning end-of-line.  I
am against changing the meaning of c-E for this purpose.  Better to let
c-E still always mean end-of-LINE, and some other key binding like s-E
mean end-of-CODE.

Teriffic.  That should make things real easy.  Now then, given that
it is contrary to the tops20 philosophy to understand things like
teco buffer blocks, is there a convenient routine someplace in TECO
that will do the proper things with argument 5 (the teco buffer block),
given the first arguments (byte pointer, character count, and things
like that).

The patch to fix texti, and the patch to prevent echoing of break
characters seems to work.  A patch to make meta characters act
like break characters may follow later....

There is an ANSI terminal type in the new TECO on TINMAN: on OZ.  It
just hasn't been merged and/or distributed yet.  It should be merged
into TECTRM.MID which will be the "termcap" sort of thing that will
be changing the most and easier to FTP (i.e. not so long).

Meanwhile, how about something like the BG escape sequences?  They're
all ANSI, but use NUL padding and has scrolling regions and I/D chars.
Let TECO think you're on a degenerate bbn bitgraph terminal...

Or, how about the VT132 sequences.  I think that has I/D char, yes?

There should be an ANSI terminal type in EMACS.  I have my Z29 set to
ANSI mode, but there is no ANSI terminal type anywhere, so the best I
can do is use VT100, which is a SUBSET!  If I say I'm a VT100 then I
don't get to use insert/delete character and other goodies, which is
especially bad at home at 1200 baud.  Any hope of getting a new type?

I don't know what people have been proposing for TOPS-20, but here is
the documentation for the system call that ITS provides to make TECO
more efficient:

ECHOIN: echo characters and store them in a buffer, 
        until a break character

	arg 1	TTY channel number
	arg 2	Byte pointer to buffer
	arg 3	Number of characters left in buffer
	arg 4	Address of break table
	arg 5	Address of TECO buffer block (or zero)

	The second and third arguments are counted out as characters
	are stored.  When the call returns due to a break character, the
	count will still be greater than zero.

	ECHOIN tells the system to echo characters and insert them in
	the buffer specified by the second and third arguments without
	requiring the user program to be executed.  This is more
	efficient and gets visibly faster response time.  Echoing
	stops when either the count is exhausted or a break character
	is input.  When this happens, the ECHOIN returns.  If it returns
	because of a break character, then the break character
	is available for normal input.	Non-break characters following
	the break character are not handled.

	Break characters are specified by the break table,
	a four-word block pointed to by the fourth argument.  Each of
	the four words says, for 32 characters, whether they break
	or not.  In the first word, the sign bit is for SAIL code 0,
	and bit 1.5 is for SAIL code 37.  The sign bit of the second
	word is for Space, and bit 1.5 is for ?.  And so on.
	Characters with Control or Meta set (including ASCII control
	characters on non-Meta keyboards) are always break characters.

	To prevent timing errors, ECHOIN will return immediately if
	there are characters in the input buffer already.

	For use by TECO, ECHOIN can update the block of counters which
	TECO uses to remember the extent of the buffer.  The fifth
	argument should point to this block, the "Buffer block", which
	is seven words long.  When a character is inserted, the first
	two words of the buffer block are not changed, the next four
	are incremented, and th next one is decremented.  Passing the
	buffer block to ECHOIN allows ECHOIN to insert characters
	directly into TECO's buffer as an indivisible operation.
	Note that the insertion of the characters themselves is still
	controlled by the byte pointer and count arguments.
	However, in the future this may change; when ECHOIN is made
	able to handle operations besides insertion, it will use the
	buffer block for updating the buffer (which may involve deletion)
	but will still insert all characters it processes down the byte
	pointer.  This way, TECO will have both an updated buffer and
	a list of the commands which the user typed.

From time to time, people bemoan that fact that the tops20 texti
jsys isnt just a little different, so that emacs could be more
efficient.  Well, based on those conversations, Ive decided to
try and do something about it, and have already come up with
several patches that may help (they havent been tested yet).

However, I am not familliar with the internal workings of ITS teco
beyond terminal support, but im not sure that just having a better
texti will help much without major modifications to teco.  IE:
Presumably you want to use texti whenever there is nothing but
whitespace to the right of the current cursor location.  Fine.
How does one TELL when such a condition is true?  How does one
find out which characters should be in the break mask? (presumably
anything that isn't tied to self-insert, but that's an EMACS concept,
and how can you notice that from within TECO?)

And so on.  SO:  Is there anyone out there who knows more about teco
than I do, who has either thought about this, or is willing to do so?

In VTS systems on Tops-20 the following bug happens when there are 2
echolines and the terminal is in WRAP mode.
If you type a carriage return to a prompt, sometimes the response will
WRAP to the top of the screen and kill the top line.  Since EMACS
doesn't expect this (as it should not), I sought a bug fix for it.

The following fix is from from Leonard N. Zubkoff at CMU and has been
working fine in the version of TECO he maintains.

Here is the place where the fix needs to be applied:

    ; DO INITIAL SETUP
    SETTTM: SAVE C
	    MOVSI A,.TICCG	; ^G ON CHANNEL 0
	    SKIPG NOQUIT	; IF QUITTING IS ALWAYS DISABLED DO NOT ARM ATI
	     ATI		; ^G, SO THAT IT WILL ARRIVE AS A COMMAND AT
				; THE CORRECT TIME (THIS IS FOR RMODE).
	    CALL DOSTIW		; SETUP TERMINAL INT MASK
	    MOVEI A,.CTTRM
	    RTMOD%		;[NEW] Read VTS Terminal Mode Word (Jsys 636)
	     ERJMP .+4		;[NEW] No VTS.
	    TLO B,(TM%SCR)	;[NEW] Turn off Wrap Mode (200000,,0)
	    STMOD%		;[NEW] Set VTS Terminal Mode Word (Jsys 637)
	     ERJMP .+1		;[NEW] No VTS.
	    RFMOD		; GET TTY MODE WORD
	    SKIPE CH,RGETTY	; PRINTING?
	     TRZA 2,TT%DAM	; NO, BINARY MODE THEN
	      TRO 2,1_6\TT%ECO	; YES, MAKE SURE DATA MODE NORMAL

			. . . .

Installing this fix will greatly help people who would like to use 2
echoline mode all the time.

Could someone please install it in the OZ version of TECO, or explain
to me the procedure for doing it?

Dear Dr. Stallman:

I wrote to you on 22 March 1982 about some problems we have with
EMACS.  I also phoned and left a note for you with one of your
colleagues.  I realize that you certainly have many more important
things to do than responding to questions.  I tried very hard to
find solutions and found a few, but menawhile additional problems
have arisen.  I would very much appreciate if you could just help
me with the journaling problem.  All the rest is not really
aggravating.

Also, would you please send me a copy of AI memo 519a,
"EMACS, the Extensible, Customizable, Self-Documenting Display Editor."

Thank you very much!

Yours sincerely,
Wolfgang N. Naegeli

                          BUGS (?) IN EMACS

Journaling    does not work as described in the manual, according to
        which the journal file should be made fully up to date on the
        disk after every 50 characters.  The journal file is opened when
        I initiate my EMACS (as requested in my init file), but nothing
        is written to it until and unless I issue the M-X End Journal
        File command. But that is not what I want.  Occasionally I have
        had some characteristics of the EMACS environment listed that
        were set at startup, and maybe even the first few commands and
        characters of input, but usually there is nothing in the file
        at all when I check at the next logon, and I have not been able
        to determine under what circumstances that minimal recording occurs.

        Despite the fact that I have set the file retention code for the
        journal file to 3 in TWENEX, only the latest one is saved.

Mode 2 Timeout     in MODE2 library does not work.  If this command is
        executed, I get an error message at the first time of update:
        QNB Q-Register not buffer - attempt to select a string or number ?
        after that there is no further attempt at updating at argument
        interval.

Display Mode Line Inverse (variable),     if set to 1 causes only the
        standard, but not the second mode line to be inverted.
        It probably as just been forgotten by the other of MODE2 library
        to check for the value of this variable.

Abstract Redefinitions  and ...

Wall Chart    abort at certain command characters that are supposedly
        undeterminable, such as ( which I have redefined to execute
         the keybord macro function from the VT100 library, which I
        have copied to my own library.

Make Page Permutation Table    does not check for the value of
        variable Page Delimiter.  Thus it is useless if anything other than ^L
        is used as a page separator.

Push to Exec,    if done from a secondary EMACS causes the system to go
        into half-duplex.  See example described under A) below.

Calling EMACS with the edit (ed) command leaves the main buffer empty
        and gives a second buffer if a file is specified as an
        argument of ed.  If used without argument, main buffer is
        entered.

C-X C-V and calling EMACS with ed first displays the end of the buffer,
        then clears display and immediately reads in the beginning.
        Particularly on slow terminals this is anoying.  Is there a way
        to supress this display of the end?

Minibuffer Size (variable),    if set to -3 with library SLOWLY is
        ignored.  Minibuffers continue to display at the top instead of
        bottom.

M-O (Set Screen Size),   if invoked for the first time without argument,
        gives just 1 line instead of defaulting to 3 as the manual says.
        Even when used with more lines, at the next invocation it reverts
        to 1 instead of giving the same number of lines as when last
        invoked and as it should accroding to the manual.

        Also, with just a 1 line screen display C-V does no longer work,
        it does not scroll, though M-V still does.

ISPELL sends out control characters that prompt the Concept-108 to
        reply with its answerback message, which in turn confuses ISPELL.
        A staccato of prompts and answers follows.  The job has to
        be started all over again after manually setting the
        answerback memory to null.  A more detailed description
        follows under example B) below.

        Neither the EMACS manual nor the ISPELL info file tells how to use
        multiple directories from within EMACS.  When using the command

M-X Command to Spell,   I get the error message:
        ?First nonspace character is not a digit
        and am left at the ISPELL prompt.  After using quit to return to
        EMACS the display is not restored but has to be redisplayed manually
        to get back to the right cursor position.

Exiting (with M-X Save All Files set in the Exit Hook) or visiting a new file
        will prompt for saving the buffer, but if one is not certain and
        attempts to check first by trying to abort the command with C-G
        one is left in an indeterminate state with neither EMACS nor TECO

        and the Echo Area ater Escapes.

Save Word Abbrevs   variable, if set to -1, does not cause incremental
        abbrevs to be written on exiting.  The init file needs to specify:
        Write Incremental Word Abbrev File for this to occur.


                               DESIRES

Calling EMACS from MM causes modeline to be updated four times in a
        row, or more precisely: initial display plus 3 updates.
        Perhaps the first three updates could be suppressed to
        save time, especially on slow terminals.

System messages are important to know, but would be much less annoying
        if they were displayed in the echo area.  It would also be
        nice to have the most recent message stored in a Q-register in
        case it is displayed at a moment when a clearing of the
        screen is in progress and it is lost before one can read it all.
        (I realize that such an enhancement would have to be implemented
        for the most part in the system software, which would have to
        check which terminals are in an EMACS session, but I trust that
        the ingenious minds behind EMACS are the most likely to come up
        with such an innovative feature.)

System commands:  It would be nice to have an extended command that
        would take any system command as an argument (hopefully with
        completion) and display responses (if any) in the echo area.
        This would avoid having to push to exec and pop back for just one
        simple command, and would save a lot of time, particularly on slow
        terminals by avoiding the need to redisplay the screen when popping
        back.

It would be convenient to have an ISPELL setup hook, to automatically
        load certain dictionaries,  maybe even depending on the
        fileextension and a variable that is set when any of the
        loaded dictionaries is augmented during a correcting run,
        so that one could check that variable and issue the necessary
        commands to dump those augmented dictionaries with the EMACS
        Exit Hook.

Do you know of a library for the Concept 108 that makes use of its 8 screen
        memory?  That might save a lot of time if one is on a slow modem
        and particularly when scrolling forth and back a lot and when using
        two widows.

Examples:
A)
I pushed from EMACS to EXEC, then after some file manipulations
I invoked MM and when I had to edit a message I used ^E (which according
to my MM.INIT is EMACS [my customized, dumped WNNMACS to be precise]).
When I wanted to look at a help file, I pushed again to EXEC.  After
getting the @ prompt I first thought I got hung up somewhere because
there did not seem to be a response, until I realized, that my commands
were actually received, but not echoed.  I only got the system output
displayed on my terminal.  It was really just like the system had switched
to half duplex while my terminal was still in full duplex. So I could not
see what I was entering.  As soon as I poped back, everything seemed to
be back to normal.  This is certainly not a sequence that I would use
very often, but I am curioous what happened.  In summary what I did was
EXEC ==> WNNMACS ==push==> EXEC ==> MM ==^E==> WNNMACS ==push==> EXEC ==pop==>
MM ==exit==> EXEC ==pop==> WNNMACS ==exit==> EXEC

B)
Before displaying a word that it does not know, ISPELL
sends RUBOUT C-R space space.  When it gives options, it sends
first RUBOUT C-Q C-D C-A.  That is before option 0.
It does not send control characters, except CRLF, before giving
additional options, if
any, but after those (before telling the line number where
the objectionable word was found) it does RUBOUT C-Q C-Q C-A.
If there are no suggestions, it sends RUBOUT C-Q C-D C-A RUBOUT
C-Q C-Q C-A anyways.  Finally, before prompting with "==>"
it sends RUBOUT C-Q C-W C-A RUBOUT C-E.

    This sounds like it might be the right thing to do on all occasions.
    Does anybody know why the exec EDIT command uses Visit File instead
    of Find File?

It's even worse than that.  If you give the EDIT command a filename it
starts a whole new EMACS.  The way to make EMACS use Find File instead
of Visit File on startup is to set Tags Find File nonzero, but you
will also either have to remember to type EDIT without a filename if
you have already started an EMACS and then use c-X c-F, or you will
have to use a smarter PCL command (which is what I do).

Is there a way to get emacs to use FIND FILE instead of VISIT FILE
when invoked by the exec EDIT command?  Since the editor fork is
normally kept around, this would be an advantage I think, since it
would prevent inadvertant loss of (possibly) multiple buffers 
containing all sorts of useful info...

I think the problem must be because ^R Exit to EXEC is in a library
loaded more recently than ^R Exit.

In the long run, the fix is to change the name ^R Exit so that
it no longer matches an initial segment of any other command name.
Perhaps it should be ^R Exit EMACS.

In the short run, EMACS can be patched by getting the value of
^R Exit out of some character which it lives in (such as Control-Meta-Z)
and storing it into a variable with M.VMM ^R Exit$.
Then M.M^R Exit$ will work properly.

In the mean time, you can win by getting the value out of C-M-Z
wuth Q...^RZ.

FS MACHINE uses the GTHOST jsys, I believe.  Or whatever it's called.
Many EMACS configuration files specify something like

 DEFINE HSTNAM
 ASCIZ /MIT-SMELL/
 TERMIN

or whatever the syntax is.  If the intended site is on the arpanet, and
the GTHOST Jsys hasn't changed in 5.3, then it's probably the case that
this macro is defined to be null in the batch file which assembles your
TECO.  Try looking at the code for FS MACHINE and see what it's assembled
to do.

Other things may know your host name because of the file
SYSTEM:HOSTNAME.TXT, which maybe EMACS should be allowed to use
conditionalized on some flag or something.

It's not that you don't know TECO; it's that you don't know EMACS argument
conventions.  Your point is that there is no standard way to force a function
bound to a key to take a string argument it would normally check for if
invoked via M-X.  X-D (M-X Dired), for instance, will ask for a string arg if
given a ^U arg.  M-X Read Mail has no such feature.

That's a general problem, and not a problem in documentation.  The standard
way to find out about arguments in EMACS is to look at the manual in the info
hierarchy, or to look at the printed manual.  There is no M-X Documentation
Apropos, although with suitable keywords placed in the manual, one could
write it.  Any takers?

    Apropos tells you about commands whose names contain a specified string.

A more useful thing for APROPOS to do would be to try to be HELPFUL.

    If you want to see how to give an argument, look in the INFO file.

As usual, the needs of people modeming at 120 c/s are simply ignored,
maybe rightly so.  I'm not going to look at windy manuals with only
iffy chances of actually addressing the question at hand, at 120 c/s.
Instead of penalizing me for not knowing (or wanting to know) TECO,
we could make the system a bit more integrated, a bit friendlier.

I believe this is a "feature".  It is considered too expensive to
update the hash code of a line for operations such as
self-insert, and so it just sets the hash code to -1.  The next
redisplay that specifies bounds that include that line will
retype it, because the hash code is wrong.  The reason that it
doesn't retyped more often is that most things are so good about
returning accurate buffer bounds to limit redisplay.

I suspect this bug has to do with the TYO HASH, but it may be unfixable
and just part of the algorithm - it's been with us for ages, but it
seems to me that I don't remember it happening three years ago or so.

Type ^R on this message and modify a line.  They type M-X ^G.
The line will be needlessly redisplayed.  It works for more than one
line, too.  ^U-^L will give the same effect, so it's presumably
it's just the redisplay routine.  When I look at the FS TYO HASH
of the affected lines, they are -1.  So does this mean that the
tyo hash isn't validated until there's a honest full redisplay, or
something like it?

cc:   DEG%SCRC-TENEX@MIT-MC.ARPA


Since most people around here use ambassadors with a 48 line display, we have
12 lines of spare display memory.  It would be really neat if emacs could use
this space effectively.  Two possibilities which seem reasonably straight-
forward would be to cache lines that are likely to be requested next (such as
the lines just below the displayed screen) or to write a command that pushes to
an exec in a 12 line window so redisplay would be faster when switching between
the exec and emacs.
(of course, this is especially useful when using emacs over a 1200 baud or
slower dialup)

Do any libraries already exist that do this sort of stuff?  If not is there
anyone out there who know teco better than I do (i.e. knows teco) who'd be
intereested in writing this, or should I figure out how to do it myself.

While in MM, I entered the editor to edit a message, and several things
did not work properly.  I don't know if this is a problem with Emacs or
MM.  What I did was go into Auto Fill Mode, then then I tried to enter
^U 72 ^X F which sets the fill column at 72.  I got some message saying
M^R q-register or some other meaningless (to me) message.  Any ideas?

You have to use
 @M(M.MWrite File)

to do this.  The "@" flag on M here means to "pretend the command
was called from a key-bound macro."  & Read Line calls f which
eventually decides whether to look at the rest of the command line
(as in M-X and inside programs) or to prompt and read.  I'm not sure
exactly why calling ^R Instant Extended Command didn't work, since presumably
it sets this flag in the macroing of the function you specify.

How can I call WRITE FILE from within a teco macro, and still have

I thought that M(M.M ^R instant extended command$)Write file$
would do this, but apparently this just write out the current file.

i'm not sure who can best solve this. when i am editing a file, and
write it back out to the same file name with same version number, the
not-backed-up bit doesn't get turned on. i assume this means that the
file, although changed, doesn't get saved in another incremental dump.
this is a loss; if the file gets written to the same name&version with
changed contents, the not-backed-up bit should get turned on so the
file's new contents can get saved on tape.

I thought you might be amused by this:

I recently introduced a beginner to Emacs. She accidentally
typed two escapes before trying to find a file with C-F C-X
and got the error message "Not top level -- can't hack files".
She thought that the computer was insulting her, telling her
that she wasn't a top notch hacker, and therefore wasn't 
good enough to be hacking files.

How does one define a command key such that it performs the action of

key to go to the top of the screen.  I see that there is a function
"^R Move To Screen Edge" that jumps to top or bottom of screen, depending
on its argument.

I can do this to assign the function to a certain key on my terminal:

m.m^R Move to Screen Edge U..B     !* 2 key  !

But what do I do so that that key means 

"perform a '^R Move to Screen Edge' with argument 1"  ????

    Date: Tuesday, 27 September 1983  15:39-PDT
    From: Goran Fagerstrom <FAGERSTROM at SU-SCORE.ARPA>

    I am running bemacs.  When I start another editing session after having
    changed variables in the 1st one, they have not taken effect. (both
    changes made by edit options and set variable.

(for non-Stanford people: BEMACS is merely EMACS with NOVICE loaded).
No, such changes only apply to one run of the program; if you want
changes to be permanent you should look into having an EMACS.VARS file.
You can find out about these in INFO node (CONV); to use INFO just
type C-X I to EMACS (it will tell you what to do from there).

    Also, what does the command set program bemacs keep start mean, and 
    what happens if you leave start and/or keep out?

It tells the EXEC to keep around your BEMACS program even when you run
some other program.  That way you don't have to take all the time of
starting up a new one, reading in your files again, etc.  Actually,
the recommended command is SET PROGRAM BEMACS KEEP CONTINUE rather than
KEEP START, since it is easier on BEMACS not to restart it all the time.
If you use BEMACS with the EDIT command none if this has any effect -
BEMACS will be automatically kept separately of any KEEP settings.
This command is only useful if you run it by typing BEMACS to the EXEC.

    Any way of getting emacs to remember last file edited when starting new
    session? (The standard editor issues the msg No filespec kept, even when
    starting emacs)

There is no way of keeping files over logging out and logging back in
again.  Keeping BEMACS as described above will do so for one login however.

The purpose of this message is to report a suspected bug in EMACS
running at USC-ISID.  The problem appears when the Display Matching
Parens feature is enabled.  If, while the opening parenthesis is being
displayed, the user types the horizontal tab (HT) character, EMACS
echoes the HT to the user's terminal BEFORE it repositions the cursor to
its proper position (i.e., after the closing parenthesis).  This causes
erroneous displays of text, data files, etc.  These errors can be
corrected by refreshing the screen (with C-L), which indicates that EMACS
is correctly entering the input data into its buffer; the problem
appears to be with the handling of the echoed data to the user's
terminal.

This problem was experienced with version 163 of EMACS and version
1208 of TECO.  It occurred in fundamental mode and text mode, both
with and without my personal customizations via emacs.init and
emacs.vars files.

I created an emacs.journal file which contains a command string to
demonstrate this phenomenon.  It is available in my directory on ISID.
Note that the JOURNAL command Replay does not exhibit the problem
(Replay waits for the cursor to return to the closing parenthesis).
However the journal file does contain the proper sequence of commands
to demonstrate the problem; if the sequence of commands is manually
entered, without waiting for the cursor to return to the closing
parenthesis before entering the horizontal tab character, the effects
will be apparent.

Please advise when the journal file is no longer needed.

Don Lambert

Sorry about that - Mark should have forwarded it to me rather than the

In any case I answered the person's question.

The other two recent questions from Score (about terminal support for
the DM and ADM5) should not be affected by any local mods.  Dave must
have been mistaken if he said he exited with C-X C-S.  I have also
noticed problems sometimes with changing terminal types by STARTing an
old EMACS - sometimes if the old type was Glass it will give PDL
overflow errors and in general make the EMACS completely useless.  I
assume some location like PADCHR or something (probably something else)
isn't getting properly initialized, but I haven't had the time to look
at the problem.

Perhaps EMACS' idea of your tty speed is wrong; do

and try it again.  If it's some DM-driver related problem, it may be
ages before anyone here takes a look at it.

If this doesn't work, please try it on MIT-OZ.

If you exit with ^X-^S, then the people at Stanford have really changed
EMACS.  We're constantly getting complaints that I can't understand; it
turns out that they're frequently due to some local modification, which of

Using EMACS 162 here at Score, I've run into the following problem: I

command.  I exit with ^x^s.  The fork is KEPT.  I DETACH the job.  I
go to a DM2500 and ATTACH the job.  I START the EMACS fork.  It mostly
works, but there is a problem with scrolling.  In particular, if I do
a ^V and then a ^P, it looks like EMACS is telling my DM to (slowly)
insert blank lines at the top, and then it fills them in, but not very
successfully (the screen gets somewhat garbaged).  It seems that EMACS
is only partially noticing that my terminal type changed.  A ^L fixes
everything until the next partial-scroll of the screen.  Of course, ^V
and ESC-V work perfectly, and if I start a new EMACS on the DM, it
works fine.
	I hope this is of some interest.

Hi.
I have some questions regarding customization of EMACS, and I was wondering
if you could help, either by telling me what to do, or getting me in touch
with someone who knows TECO pretty well.

Specifically, I would like to automatically load the VT100 library from an
EMACS vars file, then have the VT100 Setup Hook run and output the
following to the terminal:

<esc>=
<esc>[?1h

These put the arrow keys and auxiliary keypad in the proper mode for the
VT100 library.  

I would also like a Exit Hook (or Exit To Superior Hook) which would output
this to the terminal:

<esc>>   i.e.  $> 
<esc>[?1l

These return the keys to their default modes.  (Obviously, for a restarted
EMACS, VT100 Setup Hook has to be copied into Return From Superior Hook to
make sure the keys are back into the proper mode.

I have an uncomfortable feeling all of this has to be done from an EMACS
init file, if at all.  I would appreciate help converting my vars file to
an init file if that is the case.

Thank you for your time and effort.

    Does anyone remember what the trouble was
    that was fixed by making EMACS write a temporary file and rename it
    on Twenex?  I know that it was changed because it lost in some
    circumstances, but I forgot years ago what they were.

If you write to a specific version of the file, rather than the normal
version -1 (next available version), then if you open the file for
write the old contents are immediately blown away so if the system
crashes you have lost big.  EMACS makes such an effort to write
version -1 though that I think writing the temporary file and renaming
is more trouble than it is worth.  It also makes it impossible to
write to LPT: ...

However, Babyl uses Write File to save its files, and it *does* write
to specific versions normally.  Perhaps it should write the file
itself, but I think a better solution is for Write File to be smarter
about how it writes files.  If it is writing to version -1 or to a
non-disk file (test this with the DVCHR% jsys; can TECO do this?) it
should do the simple write, but if it is writing to a specific version
or version 0 of a disk file it should go with the rename.

Does anyone remember what the trouble was
that was fixed by making EMACS write a temporary file and rename it
on Twenex?  I know that it was changed because it lost in some
circumstances, but I forgot years ago what they were.

In any case, the reason why the changed Write File did not get seen
is probably that a variable MM Write File exists, and it overrides
any definitions from libraries.  In order to change the function
Write File that is used, you must set that variable to the new definition.

Subject: Redefining WRITE FILE
To: bug-emacs%MIT-OZ@MIT-MC.ARPA

I wanted to redefine Write File and ^R Save File so that with a ^U arg
they would write directly to the output file name rather than to [TECO].OUTPUT.
The reason for this is to be able to write a file into someone else's
directory where the output file gets the default protection of 775200.
That means if you, with group rights to the directory, write the temp file,
you won't be able to rename it to the desired file.  This is avoided if
you write directly to the desired file.

Anyway, I grabbed the definitions of the two functions, changed them
appropriately, added a SETUP, and stuck it all into a library
([SRI-AI]<TYSON>WRITEFILE.EMACS).  I compiled it and then loaded it.
^R Save File got loaded ok but Write File seemed to have been ignored.
The newly bound ^X^W runs the old Write File, the new ^R Save File runs
the old Write File, calling M-X Write File gets the old one.  Doing a
List Library on it indicates that the setup and the two functions are
there, each bound to the appropriate keys.

If I change the name of Write File throughout my library to XWrite File,
it all works as it should.  That indicates to me that the problem is not
in my file.

Any ideas?  Is there something special about Write File?

By the way, I suggest that these changes be made to the standard Twenex
Emacs.  It might be desirable to change the argument to do this to be
16 rather than 4 (since some people may be used to doing ^U^X^S to auto-
save).

Also, note that I haven't done more than confirm that my changes seem to
work and don't seem to affect normal operation.  I don't have much
experience with them yet.

I have several questions related to emacs init and vars files


ONE:

I would like to set up an emacs.init file such that:

1) it asks you what kind of terminal you are on
2) it runs appropriate other init or vars files for the kind of terminal
   you select.

With the help of someone here, I have come up with the following:

@ftheath, vt100, or datamedia? (h or v or d): 
@:fiu0 fi:fcu0'
(q0 - H) "e
    @ftSetting to heath.
    m(m.m set terminal type)heath
    er heath-19 init @y :m(hfx*)'
(q0 - D) "e
    @ftSetting to dm2500.
    m(m.m set terminal type)dm2500
    er dm2500 init @y :m(hfx*)'
(q0 - V) "e
    @ftSetting to vt100.
    m(m.m set terminal type)vt100
    er vt100 init @y :m(hfx*)'
er emacs;emacs init ^y et@ >
:m( hfx*( f]vb))		  


This allows the user to choose the terminal type, sets the terminal
type in emacs, and runs the appropriate init file.

One problem with the above (but relatively minor to me) is that if the
terminal type was not set correctly coming into emacs, the message
asking for the terminal type comes out garbled.  Does anyone know how
to get the question to appear BEFORE emacs tries to draw the screen at
all?

But what I really need to know is how do I get the emacs.init file to run
the user's appropriate VARS file?  Putting in:

   er vt100 vars @y :m(hfx*)'

doesn't do it.


TWO:

Since I am more comfortable with vars files than with init files, I
was hoping to be able to write a vars file for the Zenith (Heath-19)
alternate keypad.  However, the altkeypad sends characters like "ESC ? P".
I have the init file to redefine these, but I don't know how to
refer to these charcters in a vars file, so I can assign functions to
them.  Help?

Here's part of the init file:

!* Declaring keystrokes:
   m.m<command name><esc>U.<Ctrl-R><char>           For Ctrl-<char>	
   m.m<command name><esc>U..<Ctrl-R><char>          For Meta-<char>
   m.m<command name><esc>U...<Ctrl-R><char>         For Ctrl-Meta-<char>

THREE:

I have an "altkeypad.exe" file (from mit) that causes the Zenith to
use alternate keypad mode.  I know that this is accomplished by
sending an ESC-= to the terminal, but I don't know how that sequence
is saved into a file and sent to the computer.  Would someone send me
the source for altkeypad.exe?


Thanks for any help.

I'm getting very tired of losing work to the same EMACS bugs all the
time.  I've sent in at least five bug reports, all documenting
essentially the same collection of bugs, and have never ever gotten
back even an acknowledgement that anyone has seen them, much less
tried to find out what causes them.

Would someone PLEASE express an interest in FIXING some bugs?  These
bugs cause my EMACS to get illegal memory reads and writes, not to
mention illegal and undefined opcodes.  No one has ever asked to see a
crashdump, and I'm certainly not going to leave one around to hog 350
blocks in the vain hope that one of these years someone will decide to
look at it.

If anyone \is/ interested in fixing these rather serious bugs in
EMACS, please tell me.  I'll send you my bug reports, a crashdump, and
anything else you need to see.  I'm losing a working EMACS roughly
five times a day these days, and often am losing substantial amounts
of work when it croaks.  I really can't believe that no one is
interested in fixing such fundamental bugs in EMACS, bugs that have
been biting other pepole regularly as well.

If someone wants to help, thanx.

Re:   ** New ZEmacs **

Leonard - Your new release seems to have the echo area default
size set to 2 instead of 3.  This would be a win (I tried it before)
except that some interaction bug between the Emacs and Twenex
(I think it has to do with a system call used in the echo area
printing a CR at the end that cannot be suppressed) causes the top
line of the display to be wiped out whenever a command like
C-X C-W is used.  Unless you can fix this bug, I am afraid you have
to change the default back to 3.

Re:   ** New ZEmacs **

Leonard -
   The problem I described is independent of your modifications to
Emacs, as far as I know.  I discovered it a long time ago when I tried
to shrink the default echo size area from 3 to 2 running on a local
terminal without Zemacs.  Apparently it is a well known Emacs-Twenex
screw.  If you know a way to fix it, I am sure that the Emacs hackers
here would be happy to hear it (the bug has been reported to them).
For now, the only fix I know is to change the echo area size back
to 3, as I now do in my Emacs init file.

			-Chuck.

P.S. I will almost swear that other people are experiencing this
problem but haven't reported it since it is intermittent.  It took
me several weeks to notice it myself back when I reduced my echo
area in Emacs to 2.  It only occurs when Emacs uses the Twenex
system call to get completing read of file names, as in certain
commands like C-X C-W.

Re:   ** New ZEmacs **

Charles,

It seems strange to me that such a well-known Emacs-Twenex screw has never hit
me in over three years of almost exclusively using local terminals with two
echo lines on CMUC and TARTAN.  Let me see if we agree on exactly what's
happening.  At some point, one executes a command such as C-X C-W that does a
Comnd% parse of a file name from the echo area.  The entire prompt plus file
name fits on one line (right below the mode line), as in

Write File (Default PS:<ZUBKOFF>MAIL.TEMP.0): Foo.bar.5

and yet the CR somehow echoes in a manner that causes the top line of the
screen to (1) disappear entirely or (2) be cleared.  And this problem only
manifests itself on local terminals (not Chaos, for example).

Has this problem actually happened to you with the new ZEmacs and if so, is it
repeatable on demand?  If not on demand, does it happen at all consistently?
Have you ever seen the problem on other than a Concept-LNZ terminal?
Concept-HDS terminal?  Does this only happen on MIT Twenices, or have you seen
it occur elsewhere as well?  Does it only happen with WRAP mode, or with SCROLL
as well?  My suspicion is that MIT's WRAP mode, which is an extension to
Tops-20, is causing a CR or LF to automatically WRAP and clear the top line of
the screen when it shouldn't (that's why I need to know if the top line is
really cleared, deleted, or merely scrolled off the top but still present in
the terminal).  If you can give me a good idea what the conditions are that
make this happen, perhaps I will be able to find the problem, or come up with a
way around it.  As a last resort, there's going back to 3 echo lines, but to do
that right I'd have to re-build special versions of the screen managers with
that knowledge built in.

    It seems strange to me that such a well-known Emacs-Twenex screw
    has never hit me in over three years of almost exclusively using

    see if we agree on exactly what's happening.  At some point, one

With echolines set to 2.

    and yet the CR somehow echoes in a manner that causes the top line
    of the screen to (1) disappear entirely or (2) be cleared.

I think the problem is that a second CR is getting generated
by the system call prompt in addition to the one that I type to
end the command in Emacs.

I am not sure of the distinction you mean.  It becomes blank.  The
rest of the screen is unchanged

    And
    this problem only manifests itself on local terminals (not Chaos,
    for example).

No, I can repeat the problem on C108 through dialup into hardwire
port, and on AAA through our Chaosnet terminal concentrator, and
on local hardwire AAA.

    Has this problem actually happened to you with the new ZEmacs and
    if so, is it repeatable on demand? If not on demand, does it
    happen at all consistently?

It is repeatable on demand with both standard Emacs, the old ZEmacs
and the new ZEmacs.

    Have you ever seen the problem on
    other than a Concept-LNZ terminal?  Concept-HDS terminal?

See above.

    Does
    this only happen on MIT Twenices, or have you seen it occur
    elsewhere as well?

I don't know.

    Does it only happen with WRAP mode, or with
    SCROLL as well?  My suspicion is that MIT's WRAP mode, which is an
    extension to Tops-20, is causing a CR or LF to automatically WRAP
    and clear the top line of the screen when it shouldn't (that's why
    I need to know if the top line is really cleared, deleted, or
    merely scrolled off the top but still present in the terminal).

**** Yes, I think you are right.  If I set TERM NO WRAP before I start
up the Emacs, then the problem goes away.  It also seems that if I
turn WRAP back on afterward, the problem does not come back, i.e.
Emacs caches this terminal parameters.  This suggests that the
solution might be just to fix this parameters in Emacs to always be No
Wrap, regardless of what the external environment is.  (P.S. I can't
stand scrolling in my exec.)

    If you can give me a good idea what the conditions are that make
    this happen, perhaps I will be able to find the problem, or come
    up with a way around it.  

Thanks, very much for your effort.  It would be nice to have the extra
line of editing space.

    As a last resort, there's going back to
    3 echo lines, but to do that right I'd have to re-build special
    versions of the screen managers with that knowledge built in.

Strange.  I reset echolines to 3 in my init file using the new
Zemacs on my C108 dialup, and it seems to work perfectly.

BINGO!  That does it!  Thanks a million.  By the way, could you

whole screen (rather than just the current window).  I fixed this at
Sierra by putting q.1"n ' around the call to ^R Set Screen Size; could
whoever's responsible fix it in the source?

Charles,

I'm building a version of ZEmacs with space for site-specific patches to be
installed so that I can turn wrap mode off within ZEmacs.  Can you find out
for me the appropriate monitor call to turn wrap mode on and off.  It's
probably an Mtopr%.  Ideally, the monitor maintainers on OZ should fix this
problem at its source, but I gather that is unlikely.

ZEmacs still functions with a 3 line echo area, but the mode line is then
included in the insert/delete line algorithm, causing the mode line to jump
around the screen when it shouldn't, and reaulting in more redisplay than is
necessary.

    Subject: ** New ZEmacs **

    Charles,

    It seems strange to me that such a well-known Emacs-Twenex screw
    has never hit me in over three years of almost exclusively using
    local terminals with two echo lines on CMUC and TARTAN.  Let me
    see if we agree on exactly what's happening.  At some point, one
    executes a command such as C-X C-W that does a Comnd% parse of a
    file name from the echo area.  The entire prompt plus file name
    fits on one line (right below the mode line), as in

    Write File (Default PS:<ZUBKOFF>MAIL.TEMP.0): Foo.bar.5

With echolines set to 2.

    and yet the CR somehow echoes in a manner that causes the top line
    of the screen to (1) disappear entirely or (2) be cleared.

I think the problem is that a second CR is getting generated
by the system call prompt in addition to the one that I type to
end the command in Emacs.

I am not sure of the distinction you mean.  It becomes blank.  The
rest of the screen is unchanged

    And
    this problem only manifests itself on local terminals (not Chaos,
    for example).

No, I can repeat the problem on C108 through dialup into hardwire
port, and on AAA through our Chaosnet terminal concentrator, and
on local hardwire AAA.

    Has this problem actually happened to you with the new ZEmacs and
    if so, is it repeatable on demand? If not on demand, does it
    happen at all consistently?

It is repeatable on demand with both standard Emacs, the old ZEmacs
and the new ZEmacs.

    Have you ever seen the problem on
    other than a Concept-LNZ terminal?  Concept-HDS terminal?

See above.

    Does
    this only happen on MIT Twenices, or have you seen it occur
    elsewhere as well?

I don't know.

    Does it only happen with WRAP mode, or with
    SCROLL as well?  My suspicion is that MIT's WRAP mode, which is an
    extension to Tops-20, is causing a CR or LF to automatically WRAP
    and clear the top line of the screen when it shouldn't (that's why
    I need to know if the top line is really cleared, deleted, or
    merely scrolled off the top but still present in the terminal).

**** Yes, I think you are right.  If I set TERM NO WRAP before I start
up the Emacs, then the problem goes away.  It also seems that if I
turn WRAP back on afterward, the problem does not come back, i.e.
Emacs caches this terminal parameters.  This suggests that the
solution might be just to fix this parameters in Emacs to always be No
Wrap, regardless of what the external environment is.  (P.S. I can't
stand scrolling in my exec.)

    If you can give me a good idea what the conditions are that make
    this happen, perhaps I will be able to find the problem, or come
    up with a way around it.  

Thanks, very much for your effort.  It would be nice to have the extra
line of editing space.

    As a last resort, there's going back to
    3 echo lines, but to do that right I'd have to re-build special
    versions of the screen managers with that knowledge built in.

Strange.  I reset echolines to 3 in my init file using the new
Zemacs on my C108 dialup, and it seems to work perfectly.

Subject: Undefined operation codes
cc:   Tk.Foner@MIT-OZ
Reply-to: Foner at MIT-MC

Many, many times tonight, my EMACS has unexpectedly died due to
undefined opcodes being executed at various random points.

Most of the time, it happened while inside Babyl.  It happened solidly
whenever I used the ^W command, and randomly on Space and n as well.
I was reading a fairly large Babyl file, but smaller than I have
sometimes used.  (I often get ?Illegal memory reference errors looking
at large files with EMACS...  another bug which no one seems to have
ever answered.)

Usually, I got messages like
	?Illegal instruction 37000,,52053 at 7607
	?Undefined operation code
or sometimes at address 13121.  The opcode was always 37000,,52053.
Reentering sometimes worked (which left me at the normal EMACS level,
requiring a ^X r to get back into Babyl).  Sometimes, a Reenter would
cause another trap at another random address.  A couple of times, in
the middle of updating the screen, EMACS would die with an illegal
instruction of 0 at 0.  This was, of course, unrecoverable.

Unfortunately, this is not repeatable, and I run a very customized
EMACS, including, no doubt, the new MODLIN package that just came out
(I have no idea if that has anything in the world to do with it...
I'm grasping at straws).  What I'd like to be able to do is to write
out a crashdump file of my EMACS just after it's blown up, so someone
can look at its core image and find out what's going on.  How can I do
this?

This bug has bitten me every so often before now, but tonight it
happened around 20 times, which seems slightly excessive, and required
me to reset my EMACS fork roughly 8 times.

While I'm reporting bugs, by the way, I've found a bug in the EMACS
display update routines.  If one has a very long single line (longer
than a screenful), searching for a string in it leaves the cursor
positioned \one line higher/ than it should be.  Typing ^U^L or a
simple ^L lands the cursor where it belongs, so obviously it is the
update and not the search that is failing.  This is absolutely
repeatable.

Thanx much, folks.

Subject: Change to the MODLIN library
To: INFO-EMACS-RECIPIENTS @ MIT-MC

The MODLIN library now supports a new option, which allows you to see your
filenames in inverted order (as on a Lisp Machine, if you're familiar with
that). The variable is Invert Filenames, which defaults to 0 (the old behavior).
If you set it to 1, you get inverted filenames. eg,

  Normal		Inverted
  FOO;BAR >		BAR > FOO;		on ITS
  PS:<FOO>BAR.TXT	BAR.TXT PS:<FOO>	on Twenex

This may be useful for people who care more about what filename they are editing
than what directory it is on and who typically use filenames long enough that
some part of the filename gets trucated in their modeline for lack of space.

This features is available in MODLIN version 67, which has been distributed
to XX, ML, MC, DM, and OZ. Sources are on MC: EMACS1; MODLIN 67 and
OZ:PS:<EMACS>MODLIN.EMACS.67

I have FSECHOLIN$ set to 2.  On Twenex, or at least on OZ, whenever I have
to enter a filename in the echo area (e.g. ^X^W), the top line of the
screen is cleared, apparently during echo of the terminating CR.  This is
very annoying - I have to position the cursor to the top line and do M-0
C-L then find my way back to where I was, a non-trivial operation.

If this can't be fixed, could Teco or Emacs please arrange to force
refreshing of the top line in this situation?  (i.e. after reading a filename
when fsecholin$ is less than 3).

In-reply-to: Msg of 13 Jul 1983  13:49-EDT from David Eppstein <Kronj at Sierra>

It's OK to set FS OSPEED to something equal to or lower than the
baud rate (obviously).  This is advantageous if you're running at
1200 baud and EMACS thinks you're at 9600.  By setting FS OSPEED
you can avoid the extra padding.  I believe, also, that you get
a slightly different behavior at speeds 1200&below with the ^V/M-V
commands on terminals supporting I/D line.

Kronj has already pointed out that the problem you're experiencing
is due to your terminal buffer overflowing and sending ^S in the
ASCII XON-XOFF protocol.  While it's possible to get Twenex
to pay attention to these characters while EMACS is running, it's
not very useful since you can't use the ^S or ^Q keys as commands
or inside strings.

I assume you are using a Heath terminal.  These terminals need padding
for EMACS's display support, and if not paddded enough will send ^S/^Q
to try to make the computer slow down what it is sending.  Telling
EMACS that the terminal is at 300 baud has the effect of making it not
pad enough.  You should probably just leave fsOSPEED alone.

Emacs version 162   Teco version 118010

I am having a problem when I use fs ospeed to set my terminal speed,
as described on p.166 of the emacs manual (AI memo 555, 7 Oct 81).
I am connected over an ethernet so the default value for the flag is zero.
In order to speed up redisplay, my init file changes the value to 300
whenever it is zero.  This causes the ^R Kill Region command to pop
into incremental search mode during the subsequent redisplay.
The problem can be seen in barest form by doing the following:-
---------------
Start Emacs without any personal init file

Use minibuffer to set the flag

         $$300fsospeed$$

Find a file - does not seem to matter what it is

         ^X^Fdoc:mm.doc

Set mark at the top, then move down 12 lines

         ^@^U12^N

Kill the region

         ^W

During the residplay the screen gets a few garbage characters and Emacs
enters incremental search mode - prompted at bottom of screen.  The buffer
is OK, with the region deleted as it should be.

----------

The problem was discovered when connected over an ethernet, but has been
reproduced when connected by hard wired line (9600 baud).  

Thanks in advance for your help,

Martin Giles

Subject: Running out of "macro" frames
CC: bug-emacs@MIT-MC

I just spent about eight hours trying to figure out how code
that wasn't calling any macros or using any ^] commands whatsoever
could trigger the error "TMN" (too many nested macros, ^]^X, ^]^Y,
or ^]qreg).  This error is particularly insidious because it is
effectively a PDL overflow, thereby blowing away all the debugging
and backtrace aids, because there's no pdl to work with.

It turns out that creating buffers and Q-vectors uses up macro
frames also, as nearly as I can tell, and there is a rather
low limit on the number that can be created (about a hundred
or so).  My application was creating an elaborate data structure
using nested Q-vectors.

I have three recommendations:
(1) The error message should be clarified to indicate more clearly
the possible sources of overflow.
(2) It should be allowable to create many more Q-vectors than currently
possible.  I appreciate the need for a limit on runaway macros, but
the limit (expressed by MFMAX) should be variable.  Either Q-vector
creation should circumvent the overflow test, or there should be
an FS flag for raising the limit.
(3) When overflow occurs, the limit should be raised automatically
to allow the debugging routines (cf. Q..P) a little room to work in.

    Emacs uderstand that I'd gotten my screen bashed and redisplay it after a
    CLI interrupt as soon as I typed a character.  This was a nice feature,
    something Twenex emacs couldn't do because of the way tty messages work
    there.  Well, it doesn't work anymore.  After a CLI interrupt, when I
    type characters, my Emacs doesn't redisplay at all.  It doesn't do anything
    until I type something like ^L, which is an ECHOIN break character.  Is
    ECHOIN broken?

CStacy has complained of something like this in the past.  DCP, I believe,
claimed to have seen this too.  I have never seen it.  Is it reproducable?

(I don't see how ECHOIN can itself be at fault, this works by having Emacs
enable %PIATY interrupts, but perhaps emacs does does something bogus when
it finds that this interrupt occured during an ECHOIN.  I am pretty sure I
have tested that case trying to reproduce this lossage, but I have never
seen it fail...  I just tried to find the source of TECO, but I couldn't, I
wonder where it is?)

Probably what's happening is the following
  You exit EMACS whith ^X-^C.
   Control returns to the exec immediately on the ^C, leaving
   EMACS with a ^X pending.
  You return to EMACS and type ^L to redisplay the screen.
   EMACS performs ^X-^L (Lowercase Region).

You can avoid this by exiting EMACS with Z-^Z.  Note that you'll
get the same problem on ITS if you exit with ^X-^Z, which is a
"clean exit" command on TOPS-20.  I prefer to exit via ^Z-^Z, which
is a "clean exit" command on TOPS-20, and just does two ^Z's on ITS.

recently I discovered little black blotches would
appear every now and then on my SUN terminal emulator when running
Emacs on Score.  Taking a closer look I discovered that it was because
score was sending me lots of DEL characters (0177), probably because
it thought I was a losing vt100 and therefore needed lots of
padding.  I fixed it by ignoring 0177s, but the "sun" terminal
type actually does not need any padding, so removing it would
make the network communication a little more effecient.

Subject: MM Write File$ problems


First some background . . .

I have a directory on Speech with a whole mess of subdirectories (all
off the public structure, although I doubt that matters).  Every time
I was connected to (say) Ss:<Sr.Kaufman.Emacs> and tried to write a
file to, for instance, Ss:<Sr.Kaufman.Lispm>, I would get an error
saying that I needed write or owner access to the source file.  I
finally got sick of trying different protection codes (file protection
codes, directory protection codes, default file protection codes --
aieeee!) and wrote a quick hack into MM Write File that always tried
to connect to a directory before writing into it.  I called Tcompile
on it and everything worked beautifully, so I installed it in the
library my init file loads.

Now the problem . . .

When I load my Init file, somehow my MM Write File gets ignored and
the default one is used.  If I do a Tcompile on the source code, the
problem goes away again until I start a new Emacs.  Short of the ugly
solution of calling Tcompile on my Write File as part of my init
library, does anybody know how to fix this problem?  (Actually, I
suppose the proper solution might be to set up the myriad protection
codes properly, but I couldn't figure out how to do that.  I don't
even know if it's possible!)

Subject:  A proposal
To: BUG-EMACS @ MIT-MC

Tom's plea for help with adding terminal types prompted me to throw in
a suggestion that would probably add a small bit of confusion to the
already convoluted numbering scheme cause by having versions of TECO
mixed with versions of EMACS on top of TECO.

What I propose is that the entire section of TECO that deals with
terminal specifications be extracted from TECO.MID and maintained
separately as an .INSRT file, with its own version numbering.

Why?  Because we can isolate changes to TECO proper from simply an
addition of yet another terminal type.  TECO.MID is huge.  It has been
somewhat less than encouraging to FTP the entire file and run a SRCCOM
to find nothing new in TECO except that someone added support for a
new terminal.  By separating the terminal support section, we can
determine this in advance and pick up whichever is the latest.

Furthermore, I would like to propose that both files, once separated,
be considered a base, and that a change history be prepended to the
front of each for each new version from that point.

Lastly, I would like to determine if anybody's "permission" is
required to make the following change: I would like to insert
conditional code for the minority of TENEX sites to revert the
handling of the "EOL" character.  Several versions back, someone
changed that section for TOPS-20 sites, and made it unuseable for
TENEX sites.  I'd like to put it back in the distributed version so I
don't have to make local mods for each new version created, and save
other TENEX sites the trouble to figure out that they would have to
make the same changes.

I have a handle on the Space Indent Flag bug with MIDAS mode.  As you may
remember, the symptoms are that Space Indent Flag gets globally set to 1
whenever MIDAS mode is entered.  This causes autofilling in other buffers
to lose and do a TAB at the beginning of every line.

Here is the first part of the code for MIDAS Mode:

    M(M.M &_Init_Buffer_Locals)    !* See comment at top of file.!
    [2 FQ2:"G :I2 MIDAS'
    1,1M.L Space_Indent_Flag
    1,32 M.L Comment_Column
    1,(:I*;) M.L Comment_Start

Note that M.L is given the 1, argument meaning to assume the local doesn't
alredy exist.  This is done on the Comment Column variable also, but it
doesn't have this losing behavior.  Neither of these variables is created
by MIDAS mode -- they both already exist.

If I reverse the order above, and make Comment Column be set before Space
Indent Flag, the lossage doesn't happen to either variable.

If anyone knows what's going on, please take a look at it.  I wrote out a
new version of USRCOM with the change.

ReSent-to: Editor People: ;

I was a participant (technical EMACS) in the Roberts-Moran study, and
so was my sister (nontechnical Star).  Based on those two data points
I can only conclude that the entire study is fraudulent.  I got my
hands on a draft of the paper last fall, and exchanged quite a number
of messages with Moran about it.  He used magnificently circular
reasoning to discount my complaints.  It seems to be typical of some
"researchers" in the psychology/human factors area to put data above
reality, and to believe that a bunch of measurements taken to 3
significant figures, regardless of the meaning of what is being
measured, constitutes truth.  I suppose that in a sense he is
harmless, because he will just go off and design an editor based on
his idea of the truth, but it annoys me to have pseudo-fact being
paraded as demonstrated truth.

I normally use EMACS on a Concept-100 terminal running at 9600 baud
on a lightly-loaded VAX.  Like all serious EMACS users, I have a set
of custom key-bindings and custom text-oriented functions that I have
developed over the years, and a set of work habits and strategies
based on the response speed to which I am accustomed.

When I went to Xerox to participate in this study, I was required to
use an Alto running a DM-2500 simulator at about 1000 baud, connected
over an Ethernet link to a DEC-10 running a fairly old TENEX EMACS.
I complained bitterly at the time that (a) this setup was too slow,
less than 1/10th the speed at which I was accustomed to running, that
(b) the keystroke/response delays were short-term unpredictable
(Ethernet delays depend on other load on the ethernet), that (c) the
Alto was in terrible adjustment (small fuzzy letters) and that (d)
the cursor was nearly invisible [the DMchat program that they were
running has two modes of operation, one with a fly-speck cursor and
the other with a bigger boldface cursor, and I was unable to get the
experimentor to let me fetch a version of DMchat that had a visible
cursor].  A final factor invalidating the data was that DMchat/Alto
shows 60 lines on the screen, so that whenever the display must be
completely repainted it takes a substantial fraction of a minute
(80*60/100=48 seconds to redraw the entire screen.

Because of the intermittent and unpredictable delays in the Ethernet
connection I was unable to make proper use of cursor-positioning
commands:  I had to wait for the display to quiesce after each burst
of cursor commands, and I often found myself overshooting a word or a
line and needing to go back the other direction.  Because of the
nearly-invisible cursor I was unable to make proper use of search
commands for positioning the cursor; I often found myself issuing a
search and then spending 10 or 15 seconds hunting for the cursor on
the screen.  Because of the enormous screen and the slow baud-rate I
was unable to scroll through the file just looking for things, and
whenever a search went off the end of the current window there was a
30-second penalty while the screen was repainted.  I finally realized
the big-screen problem about halfway through the editing session and
split the screen into two windows and shrunk the one I was using,
which helped a lot.

When I complained to Moran that the data he had taken on my EMACS
usage bore no relation to the way that EMACS is used in real life, he
responded with the smug circular argument that "the EMACS data
corresponded perfectly with the keystroke model, and therefore it
must be right." This "keystroke model" is a creation of Moran and
some of his colleagues, based on data that they have taken in
previous years.  Claiming that the keystroke model supports this data
is tantamount to claiming that their sloppy experimental technique
has not improved over the years, and that the measurements on which
they based their keystroke model were just as bad as the measurements
they are making today.

I had reasons more than mere disgust with their experimental
technique to be suspicious of their results.  I had spent a good part
of the previous summer doing BravoX editing at Xerox PARC, and had
measured the number of wall clock minutes that it took me to make
various changes.  I often time myself for Emacs edits in my office,
using my wristwatch rather than some fancy electronic measuring gear,
and my speed at editing with Emacs in my office was uniformly about
double my speed at editing with BravoX at Xerox, for similar kinds of
material.  I would be reluctant to claim even one significant figure
of precision in these measurements, since the material being edited
was not the same, and I included the time to take a sip of coffee, to
listen to conversation in the hall, and sometimes to read the
material that I was editing.  But in spite of all this noise it was
overwhelmingly obvious to me that Emacs let me edit much more quickly
than BravoX.

It is nice to have people taking real data.  Numbers are often good.
But numbers are not, of necessity, correct, and I think that the
community of people who design and evaluate text editors needs to be
extremely careful when reading the results of this particular study.
It won't make a whole lot of difference to posterity whether or not
Emacs is better or worse than editor X or Y, but it will certainly
matter if a large body of belief about text editors gets built up
from completely incorrect data.  This whole Roberts/Moran study
reminds me very much of the old saw about the drunk who was looking
for his lost wallet under the streetlamp, even though he didn't lose
it there, because the light was better.  I don't think anybody really
knows how to measure effectiveness of text editors as they are
actually used, so instead people find things that they do know how to
measure, and then concoct elaborate theories trying to tie these
measurements to the elusive unmeasurable truth.

Be careful of the great god whose name is Data; he is a slippery and
deceitful god.

I had a Sketch library which a few people were using and it had a number
of misfeatures that people didn't seem to like, so it's just been redone
in an incompatible-but-better (I hope) way.

Loading the library SKETCH will set up c-m-S as a dispatch character for
Sketch commands. You can create libraries of sketches and list the contents
of such libraries. You can insert, edit, or view existing sketches from
a library.

The library is mostly self-documenting. A few relevant things that are
not really documented anywhere...

Anything in the sketch which has angle brackets around it will be prompted
for. Hence, you can have a sketch like:

 Dear <Name>,

 Hi, how are you?

and it will prompt "Name: " when you try to insert it, making the obvious
replacement. If you want to put a "<" into a sketch, put control-Q before it.
Also, the character "~" is used to mark the position in the sketch where
you want the cursor to end up. As you might expect, control-Q will quote it.
Also, the format of sketch libraries has changed; control-L separates entries
(also requiring control-Q if it wants to exist in a sketch).

Apologies for any problems this incompatibility will cause. I think the
general effect will be for the better.

Non-MIT maintainers can get the new library from MC:EMACS1;SKETCH 51 or
from OZ:PS:<EMACS>SKETCH.EMACS.51

I recall that there were problems with TECO writing output

[TECO].OUTPUT.  I don't remember what they were.
If anyone can be tracked down who rememberes, a comment

If the current system works best when file protection is not in use,
then it should bnot be changed.  People who do not use

I would like this flushed.  It repeatedly screws users to have EMACS write

The DIR.INFO pointer for Tex was "<Tex.Doc>TBase", and since INFO is
using a default device of "DSK:" (which is defined to mean connected
directory), it wasn't working very well.  I moved TBASE's .INFO file
to INFO: and made the pointer just (TBASE), which will make it work
always, but someone should probably use a more reasonable default
like "PS:" for finding info files.

You can't do it right now.  Peter Gergely has a new keyboard macro
package that lets you do lots of wonderful things.  Hopefully that
will be ready by the beginning of next month.

[This is a question, not a bug.] How do I save several keyboard macros
together in one file? I Have tried appending  individual files togenther,
but the resulting aggregate won't load. Is there a way to dump a 
whole bunch into one file, or is there some special separator protocol?

 Would you be willing to rename the message:
   Write out changes in old_modified_file?  
to something like:
  There appear to be changes in old_modified_file.  Do you want to write them 
out before ...?

I  seem to remember getting confused by this a while ago.

Bolio mode seems to be undefined in emacs.  Also, I seem to be having
trouble exiting from the equivalent of the kill or save buffers menu.

when i do a Query Replace$ the search string is set so that ^S/^R will search
for the string, but it doesn't show me in the echo area... Replace String$ and
Query Replace$ should set whatever ^S and ^R looks at to show the defaults.

I moved the bug file to EMACS1;.  EMACS; suffers from the same problem as
SYS;, and there isn't an EMACS: device like there is a SYS:, so we have to
make do.

Subject: Glitch in C-Rub
To: bug-emacs@MIT-AI.ARPA
cc: csd.kronj@SU-SCORE.ARPA, jlh.bradford@Sierra

Strange problems with C-Rub (^R Tab Hacking Rubout): If I insert 10
tabs on a line (which leaves the cursor at the right margin) then any
other text (which wraps around) then move back to the end of the tabs
(left margin of the second screen line) and type C-Rub, a TAB is
deleted without being converted to spaces.  If the amount of extra
text at the end of the line is 6 characters or less, the re-display is
also wrong; it only does one DELCH on the first screen line (i.e.  the
Excl is moved one space left and no characters are moved from the
second to the first screen line).  Now comes the wierd part: if in the
second case I ask for a re-display or move the cursor or ask for help,
then the display and any other tests reveal that a tab has been
deleted; if instead I immediately type another C-Rub or type a C-Rub
after C-@ or C-X . (chosen as tests since they don't affect the
display), two TAB's are gone and there are 13 (not 14) spaces in their
place!

To reiterate, the exact character sequences which will reproduce the
reported bugs are (starting at the beginning of a line):
  C-U 10 TAB A B C D E F G M-B C-RUB
  (Display will be normal, but a whole tab is deleted.)

  C-U 10 TAB A B C D E M-B C-RUB C-L
  (Display was strange before C-L; now a whole tab is deleted and
   display reflects that.)

  C-U 10 TAB A B C D E M-B C-RUB C-RUB
  (Display is normal, but two tabs were deleted and there are 13
   spaces in their place.)

My terminal is a Zenith 19, but I don't think that's significant.
