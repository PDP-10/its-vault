!& Experimental Lisp Indentation Hook:! !& Internal hook to help Lisp indentation!
!* This function assumes f has been done and that q..0, q..1, and q..2 are set up.
Argument conventions --
 ^X is pos of head of sexp (leading open paren)
 ^Y is cursor position at indent time
 qZ is the offset from end of buffer of the cursor pos we began at !
