!* -*-TECO-*-
This file has enough of Babyl to generate a library that can be autoloaded
to send mail (e.g. via C-X M) quickly (and not take up much library space).
Note that BABYL proper (the mail reader) must be generated from BABYL > and
BABYLM > -- it is NOT true that BABYL > has enough to read but not send
mail, since they both share some utility routines and those are in here.

Modification history:

11/10/81   79	ECC	Removed & Expand Mailing Lists, since MMcM claims that
			XMAILR now performs mailing list expansion.
11/02/81   78	ECC	Fixed & Expand Mailing Lists infinite loop bug.  Was
			looping for non-mailing-list entries.
 6/11/81   76	EAK	Removed DM hack because PDL claims COMSYS will handle
			COMSAT input files now.  Deleted the following line:
			fsMachine-(f6DM)"e etAI:'
 4/20/81   74   Moon	Mailing lists for Tenex (see & Expand Mailing Lists)
 3/25/81   73	ECC	F, V, R, and & Setup Reply Template moved into BABYL
			proper since are either only for mail-reading (F and
			R) or is a dispatch (V) command.  Make BABYLM smaller.
 2/16/81   72	ECC	F and R only use 1 line of subject, since ITS mailer
			cannot handle (I think).
12/20/80   69	ECC	Changed yanker in accordance with Babyl changes to set
			bounds just around message.
11/07/80   64	ECC	Work on F: fixed so done hook goes off in *Babyl*, not
			*Mail*.  Added variable and argument options to
			control reading To/Subject, whether into .
			Mail edit level binds C-M-\ to filler.
11/07/80   61	EAK,ECC	Made F use @:F to optimize redisplay by
			scrolling the message down to where the yanked
			message will be, and back up when done.
 ??? -- what JP work in here? -- ???
 9/17/80   52	ECC	Changed Edit and Mail Buffer to print only header and
			current line if printing terminal.  Used to print
			whole buffer, bad for C, 3R, 4R, F.
 8/27/80   50	ECC	Added pruning of BBOARD@ to INFO- and * pruning.  Also
			made Babyl Dont Reply To search bounded over <CRLF>
			<mailbox> <CRLF> so username can be fully delimited.
 8/24/80   48	ECC	Added 2-window control to M, C, F, and V (new template
			command).  Renamed # Babyl ^F to # Babyl F.  Should do
			the opposite in BABYL for the finder function.
 8/24/80   45	ECC	Split up the R/M/C/F shared code in # Babyl R and
			distributed it among R, M, C, and F for clarity and
			better modularity.  New routine & Push to Edit Mail
			which they call.  Renamed # Edit Mail to Edit and Mail
			Buffer, since it can conceivably now be user callable
			on any buffer, and since it now sends the mail.  #
			Babyl ^F keeps same subject or makes one, and calls
			the parser.  Deleted the obsolete idea-file RMCF >.
 8/24/80   40	ECC	Added mail template hacking to # Babyl R and added
			Mail With Template (# Babyl V) and Set Mail Template.
			Changed some variable names and declared all of them
			so user can use Edit Options etc.  Names changed to
			include "Babyl" in their names to allow giving "Babyl"
			as filter to Edit Options.  Changes (<...> is added):
			<Babyl> Dont Reply To
			<Babyl> CC To
			<Babyl> Require Subjects
			Babyl Reply Hook -> Babyl Edit Mail Hook
			<Babyl> Day of Week Flag
			<Babyl> User Name
			<Babyl> Personal Name

 8/23/80   38	ECC	& Process Recipient Field modified, primarily to leave
			recipient buffer with pairs of lines, not only mailbox
			names, but full recipients as well for more general
			use as a parser.  # Babyl R uses it to remove
			duplicate and unwanted recipients.  Semantics of Dont
			Reply To changed a little, and INFO-xxx and *xxx
			always removed.  Added option Babyl Trim Recipient List
			to control whether any of this is done.
 7/17/80   20	ECC	& TNX Mail Buffer ensures that there is a final CRLF.
			Was necessary for XMAILR, though XMAILR claims now to
			be fixed so it could possibly be removed.  Changed
			recipient pruning to (1) use just the mailbox part of
			TO (not host, not rfc733 personal name), and (2)
			delete the entire recipient, not just a stupid FKD.
			Also it will remove a lone Cc: line with no recipients.

!Mail With Template:! !C Edit and send mail, with template initialization.
The message is initialized from a template, which may specify any
    header or text components.  The template is a variable, containing
    a copy of what the mail editing buffer should be initialized to.
String argument is a template name.  The template variable name is
    formed from this name -- e.g. for a template named "Foo", the
    variable is named Babyl Template Foo.  If you are using the Babyl
    V command the template name is read with completion.
If you give a numeric argument of 2, we will try to use 2 windows,
    current message in top one, message being sent in bottom one.
See the M-X Set Mail Template command for aid in creating templates.
Runs the Teco program in the variable Babyl M Hook if one.  This
    program can check the variable Current Babyl Template Name, 0 for
    normal mailing, if it wants to further process the template.!

!Set Mail Template:! !C Create or reset a mail template from buffer contents.
See the M-X Mail With Template or # Babyl V command for using
    templates.
String argument is a template name.
Providing a numeric argument means that you are resetting an existing
    template, and completion can be used to read the template name (if
    you call this with ^R Instant Extended Command).
The template is taken to be the entire contents of the buffer.  This
    command is generally given while in a recursive mail edit level.!

!Edit and Mail Buffer:! !S Edit some mail to send in recursive edit level.
To send the mail, exit the recursive edit level with ^R Exit.
To abort, use Abort Recursive Edit.  If you abort, you can
    continue editing the message later with the C command from Babyl
    or by giving Send Mail an argument.
The ^R Babyl Yank command will insert a copy of the current Babyl
    message if there is one.  (E.g. the one being replied to.)
Paragraph Delimiter is temporarily set so lines starting with "-"
    won't be considered part of a paragraph.  Thus the --Text...  line
    won't get in the way of a ^R Fill Paragraph.
If the variable Babyl Require Subjects is non-0, you will be asked to
    supply a subject line if you forgot to include it while editing.
The variable Babyl Edit Mail Hook may be set to a Teco program to run
    just before entering the recursive edit level.  If this variable
    is 0, we will connect C-M-Y to ^R Babyl Yank, C-M-\ to ^R Fill
    Indented Mail Region, and set the Paragraph Delimiter variable.!

 !* Note:  This function cannot be named & Edit Mail, since the "&" will cause!
 !* HELP-R not to consider it for describing.  It used to be called # Edit!
 !* Mail for that reason before it became a user-callable (if ever desired)!

!& Process Recipient Field:! !S Merge, reform and parse.
NUMARG is recipient buffer, pre-comma NUMARG is default host name.
STRARG is field name, without any colon.
Bounds should be set to just the header.
All instances of the field are merged into one, with continuation
    lines.  Some cleaning is done (of whitespace, @s), host name is
    added if necessary, and field is auto-filled.
If variable Babyl Strip Local Host is non-zero, then the local host
    name is removed.
Point is left at the start of the field body.
Recipient buffer has the parse, a pair of lines per recipient:  1st
    line is mailbox name, 2nd line is full (cleaned up) recipient
    specification.  Host names are upper-case since TWENEX mailer
    requires it.!
