D.1 \_[Introduction]
	In general, Equations 4.10-4.11 are difficult to solve.  In order to derive a dispersion relation we assumed the forms of the potential and density eigenmodes without regard to whether or not they satisfied these equations.  In this appendix we outline the procedure for solving for the \2exact\0 eigenmodes and frequencies.  An exact solution of Equations 4.10-4.11 is possible for special equilibrium profiles.  However, these are not very unrealistic with regards to the experimental profiles.
\s2
D.2 \_[The Eigenmode Equation]
	The equilibrium potential @f{o} and density /n{o} profiles of which the linear eigenmodes can be derived are:
\q[][n{o}(x) = n exp\(-\[x][@l]\)]
and
\q[][@f{o}(x) = -E{o}x]
Substituting these profiles into Equations 4.11 result in linear constant coefficient second order differential operators given by
\q[D.1a][L{1e} = \[d`2'][dx`2'] + \[E{o}][T{e}]\[d][dx] - B{e}]
\q[D.1b][L{2e} = -\[n{o}(x)][T{e}]\(\[d`2'][dx`2'] - \[1][@l]\[d][dx] - A{e}\)]
\q[D.1c][L{1i} = \[d`2'][dx`2'] + \[E{o}][T{i}]\[d][dx] - B{i}]
\q[D.1d][L{2i} = -\[n{o}(x)][T{i}]\(\[d`2'][dx`2'] - \[1][@l]\[d][dx] - A{i}\)]
where
\q[][A{s} = k{y}`2' + (1 + @b{s}`2')k{z}`2' @- \[ik{y}@b{s}][@l]]
and
\q[][B{s} = k{y}`2' + (1 + @b{s}`2')k{z}`2' @- \[ik{y}@b{s}E{o}][T{s}] + \[i@w(1 + @b{s}`2')][D{s}]]
where the minus sign is used for the ions, the plus sign for the electrons.  
	In order to reduce Equations 4.10 into a fourth order differential equation we must find two additional second order differential operators which satisfy the condition
\q[D.2][L{A}L{2e} + L{B}L{2i} = 0]
By substituting
\q[][L{A} = \:sum[a{j}\[d`j'][dx`j']][j=0][2]    L{B} = \:sum[b{j}\[d`j'][dx`j']][j=0][2]]
into Equation D.2 we can solve for the /a and /b coefficients.  After some straigth forward algebra we obtain
\q[D.3a][L{A} = -\[d`2'][dx`2'] + \[1][@l]\[d][dx] + A{i}]
\q[D.3b][L{B} = \[d`2'][dx`2'] - \[1][@l]\[d][dx] - A{e}]
With these operators we may combine Equations 4.10 into a fourth order \2constant coefficient\0 differential equation given by
\q[D.4][\(\[d`4'][dx`4'] - \[1][@l]\[d`3'][dx`3'] + C{2}\[d`2'][dx`2'] + C{1}\[d][dx] + C{0}\)n{#}(x) = 0]
where /n{#} = /e/x/p(/x/@l)/n{1}(/x) and
\q[][C{2} = \[-A{i} + B{e} + \[E{o}][T{e}@l] - K{e} + @q\(A{e} + B{i} + \[E{o}][T{i}@l] + K{i}\)][1 - @q]]
\q[][C{1} = \[\[B{e}][@l] - \[A{i}E{o}][T{e}] + \[K{e}][@l] - @q\(\[B{i}][@l] + \[K{i}][@l] - \[A{e}E{o}][T{i}]\)][1 - @q]]
\q[][C{0} = \[A{i}B{e} - @q(A{e}B{i} + A{e}K{i}) + A{i}K{e}][1 - @q]]
where
\q[][@q = \[T{i}][T{e}]]
\q[][K{s} = \[1][@l`2'] + \[E{o}][T{s}@l] - B{s}]
	Equation D.4 is the eigenmode equation which must be solved subject to the boundary conditions
\q[][n{#}(x=0) = n{#}(x=d{ca}) = 0]
and
\q[][@f{o}(x=0) = @f{o}(x=d{ca}) = 0]
The potential boundary conditions are related to those of the density eigenfunction by either of Equations 4.10.
\s2
D.3 \_[The Eigenmodes and Eigenfrequencies]
	The general solution of Equation D.4 is
\q[D.5][n{#}(x) = \:sum[N{j}exp(s{j}x)][j=1][4]]
where the /s{j}'s are the four roots of the characteristic equation [Boyce and DiPrima, 1969]
\q[D.6][s`4' - \[1][@l]s`3' + C{2}s`2' + C{1}s + C{0} = 0]
Using the density boundary conditions we find that the coefficients /N{j} must also satisfy
\q[D.7][\:sum[N{j}][j=1][4] = 0]
and
\q[D.8][\:sum[N{j}exp(s{j}d{ca})][j=1][4]]
The remaining two relations can be derived by substituting Equation D.5 into Equation 4.10 and equating coefficients of \2exp(s{j}x)\0.  The results are
\q[D.9][\:sum[\(\[(s{j}`2' - \[1][@l`2']) + \[E{o}][T{e}](s{j} - \[1][@l])][s{j}`2' + \[E{o}][T{e}]s{j} - A{e}]\)N{j}][j=1][4] = 0]
\q[D.10][\:sum[\(\[(s{j}`2' - \[1][@l`2']) + \[E{o}][T{e}](s{j} - \[1][@l])][s{j}`2' + \[E{o}][T{e}]s{j} - A{e}]\)exp(s{j}d{ca})N{j}][j=1][4] = 0]
	In general Equations D.6-D.10 must be solved numerically.  First we should solve the characteristic equation, then with each /s{j} Equations D.7-D.10 are solved.  Notice that they are linear algebraic equations.  The determinant of the coefficients of /N{j} is the dispersion relation from which the eigenfrequency(ies) @w are calculated.  The effects of \_[E]{o}@.@n{p} on the eigenfunctions and frequencies can be determined by making /E{o} positive or negative.
