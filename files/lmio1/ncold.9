Procedure to load a new Cold Load:    (as of 4/14/78) 

1)   Load COLD-LOAD itself by typing (LOAD-COLD) to the Lisp level of CC.
2)   Start the load and verify that it basically runs.  The first time you
     start it, it will take about 15 seconds before it says 105 foobar.
3)   Load a FILE job on PDP-10.
4)   Type (QLD) on the Lisp Machine, and answer "Yes" to all questions.
     Expect it to take 11 minutes.  Don't be surprised that QFASL gets
     loaded twice, also currently LISP-TOP-LEVEL, ERROR, SPECIAL, & UNSPECIAL.
5)   When it halts, (CC-DISK-SAVE <N>). Label as "With World".


TO LOAD WOODS:
    (PKG-LOAD "WOODS;+LOAD QFASL")
    (LOAD-WOODS)
TO RUN WOODS:  (RUN-WOODS)

TO LOAD MINIMA:
    (PKG-LOAD "MINIMA;LOADER QFASL")
    (LOAD-MINIMA)
TO RUN MINIMA: (RUN-MINIMA)


The following is the old way, kept in this file just in case anyone
is curious.
PROCEDURE TO LOAD A NEW COLD LOAD:

1)   LOAD COLD-LOAD ITSELF BY (LOAD-COLD) TO LISP LEVEL OF CC.
2)   DO (QLD) TO LISP LEVEL OF CC TO LOAD  QLD, QFASL, AND QFILE.
3)   (CC-DISK-SAVE <N>). LABEL AS NEW COLD LOAD ON SHEET.
4)   START LOAD AND VERIFY IT BASICALLY RUNS.
5)   LOAD FILE JOB ON 10, AND TYPE (QLD) AT LISPM.
6)   TYPE Y TO QFCTNS, FINTRN, QMISC, TV2, STRING, STRUCT AND TVWARM, N TO ALL THE OTHERS.
7)   (SET-MEMORY-SIZE 400000) TO SPEED THINGS UP
8)   INITIALIZE "INITIAL" OBARRAY BY (PKG-OBCOPY)
9)   DO (QLD) AGAIN, AND TYPE Y TO EVERYTHING.
10)  (CC-DISK-SAVE <N>) LABEL AS "WITH WORLD"
