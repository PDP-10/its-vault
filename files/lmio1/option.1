This file lists the init-plist options available in the window system.
Some of them are even documented; eventually they all will be.

For flavor TV:SHEET (thus all windows):

:DEEXPOSED-TYPEOUT-ACTION	;default is NIL
	What to do when a window is not exposed and tries to type out.  NIL means go
	into output hold.  :EXPOSE sends the window an :EXPOSE message, :PERMIT types
	out anyway (this only really makes sense if you have a bit array).  A list
	is LEXPR-FUNCALL-SELF'ed as a message (e.g. (:FUNNY-EXPOSE-MESSAGE OPTION)).
:PRIORITY
:NAME string
:WIDTH overall-width-in-pixels
:HEIGHT overall-height-in-pixels
:CHARACTER-WIDTH arg
	arg is a count of characters or a string, whose width in font 0 is used.
:CHARACTER-HEIGHT arg
	arg is a count of lines, or a string, whose number of lines is used.
:BIT-ARRAY
:LEFT-MARGIN-SIZE
:TOP-MARGIN-SIZE
:RIGHT-MARGIN-SIZE
:BOTTOM-MARGIN-SIZE
:SUPERIOR
:FONT-MAP			;default is NIL
	An actual ARRAY of the internal font map, or a list of fonts (really fonts, not
	symbols), or NIL for the screen defaulty (CPTFONT for the CPT).
:LEFT :X
:RIGHT
:TOP :Y
:BOTTOM
:EDGES  (left top right bottom)
:REVERSE-VIDEO-P   ;default is NIL
:MORE-P   ;default is T
:VSP  spacing-between-lines   ;default is 2
:BLINKER-P   ;default is T
:BLINKER-FUNCTION   ;default is RECTANGULAR-BLINKER
:BLINKER-DESELECTED-VISIBILITY   ;default is :ON
	Above 2 are args to cursor-following blinker created if :BLINKER-P is T
:INTEGRAL-P   ;default is NIL
:SAVE-BITS   ;default is NIL (changed by some flavors?)
:RIGHT-MARGIN-CHARACTER-FLAG   ;default is NIL
	Character to print when lines wrap around at the right margin.
:TRUNCATE-LINE-OUT-FLAG   ;default is NIL


For flavor TV:SCREEN
:BITS-PER-PIXEL   ;default 1
:FONT-ALIST   ;nyi
:DEFAULT-FONT   ;default FONTS:CPTFONT
:BUFFER		;fixnum location of screen memory
:BUFFER-HALFWORD-ARRAY	;ART-16B array to above
:LOCATIONS-PER-LINE
:CONTROL-ADDRESS
:PROPERTY-LIST	;options for the color screen, for example.


For flavor TV:WINDOW:  (all windows)

:EDGES-FROM
   One of (left top right bottom), :MOUSE, a window whose edges to copy
   Or a string, in which case the window is made big enough to accomodate
   the string displayed in font 0, plus the margins.
:MINIMUM-WIDTH   ;I think these only apply to :EDGES-FROM :MOUSE
:MINIMUM-HEIGHT
:EXPOSE-P   ;default NIL


For flavor TV:BASIC-BORDERS:

:BORDERS   ;default T
	NIL means not to put any borders.
	A symbol or a number is the same as a list of that 4 times.
	A list is (left top right bottom) or a property list for the
	:LEFT, :TOP, :RIGHT, :BOTTOM properties if it starts with one of
	those symbols.  Each of the left, top, right, bottom specs is:
		NIL - put no border there
		T - the default function with the default width
		a number - the default function that wide
		a symbol - that function with its default width
		(function . width) - that function, that width
		(function left top right bottom) - where those 4 numbers
			define a rectangle within the particular border
			to be operated upon by the function.  This is the
			internal form; externally only the width and height
			implied by these numbers will be paid attention to.
    The available border functions are:
	TV:DRAW-RECTANGULAR-BORDER.  This is the default.  It makes black.
		Its default width is 1.  It appears to be the only
		function currently defined.
:BORDER-MARGIN-WIDTH   ;default 1
	Width of the white space between the black border and the
	inside contents of the window.


For flavor TV:ESSENTIAL-LABEL:

LABEL   ;default is T
	:TOP - put it at the top
	:BOTTOM - put it at the bottom
	    These override the flavor's default, which depends but is
	    usually bottom.
	If it is a list, the first four elements define the left, top,
		right, bottom of the label area relative to the window,
		except that externally only the implied height and whether
		it goes at the bottom or the top are paid attention to.
		This is the internal form; negative numbers are up for the bottom
		or left from the right (COMPUTE-LABEL-POSITION figures this out).

For flavor TV:BASIC-LABEL:

:LABEL   ;default is T
    In addition to the features of ESSENTIAL-LABEL, this may be:
	A string, to specify what to put in the label.  This defaults
	to the window's name, which is usually what you want.
	A font, to specify what font to display the string (window's name) in.
	A list, (left top right bottom font string), with font and string
	optional.


For flavor TV:BASIC-STREAM:

:IO-BUFFER
:RUBOUT-HANDLER-BUFFER


For flavor TV:BASIC-PROCESS:

:PROCESS


For flavor TV:POP-UP-NOTIFICATION-WINDOW:

:WINDOW-OF-INTEREST


For flavor TV:BASIC-CONSTRAINT-FRAME:

:EXPOSED-PANES
:PANES
	( elt ...) where elt is either (name . pane) or
	(name pane-flavor init-plist...).  Name is the name of the
	pane, typically a symbol, and pane is a window (not actually
	possible to do this in the init-plist since the window's
	superior would not exist yet.)
:CONSTRAINTS
	( (configuration-name . constraint-S-expr)...)
	The details of constraint descriptions are documented elsewhere.


For flavor TV:HYSTERETIC-WINDOW:

:HYSTERESIS   ;default 25.
	This is how far you have to move the mouse out of the window
	before it is really considered to be out.


For flavor TV:BASIC-SCROLL-BAR:

:SCROLL-BAR   ;default T
	NIL - no scroll bar
	T - width of 1
	number - width
	(left top right bottom) - where it goes, but externally you
		can only specify the width this way.
	This selects where in the margins the scroll bar lights up to
	show what portion of the scrollable buffer is currently visible.
:SCROLL-BAR-ALWAYS-DISPLAYED   ;default NIL
	Default is only to display it while mouse is in it.


For flavor TV:MENU:

:LAST-ITEM   ;I don't think you really want to init these
:CHOSEN-ITEM
:COLUMNS   ;default 1, number of columns if not NIL
:FILL-P   ;default NIL, T means no columns
:ITEM-LIST   ;see the menu documentation
:INITIAL-GEOMETRY  ;if specified, is list of args to :COMPUTE-GEOMETRY msg
		;I think this overrides :COLUMNS and :FILL-P, I am unsure.


For flavor TV:COMMAND-MENU:

:IO-BUFFER - where to send the magic lists it generates when clicked on.


For flavor TV:BASIC-SCROLL-WINDOW:

:DISPLAY-ITEM   ;default NIL
:TRUNCATION   ;default NIL


For flavor TV:BASIC-SCROLL-MOUSE:

:DEFAULT-BLINKER-FUNCTION   ;default TV:HOLLOW-RECTANGULAR-BLINKER
:TYPE-ALIST   ;default NIL
:ITEM-BLINKER


For flavor TV:TEXT-SCROLL-WINDOW:

:ITEMS   ;default NIL
:TOP-ITEM   ;default 0


For flavor TV:FUNCTION-TEXT-SCROLL-WINDOW:

:PRINT-FUNCTION
	the function for printing a line of the window
:PRINT-FUNCTION-ARG
	the common argument to that function, other arguments are the line-contents and
	position.

For flavor TV:MOUSE-SENSITIVE-TEXT-SCROLL-WINDOW:

:SENSITIVE-ITEM-TYPES   ;default T


For flavor TV:MARGIN-REGION:

:REGION-LIST
	regions of the margins that are sensitive to the mouse

For flavor TV:MARGIN-SCROLL:

:MARGIN-SCROLL-REGIONS
	legends shown in the top and bottom margins that you can click on
	alist of WHERE (either :TOP or :BOTTOM), empty message, more message, font.
	default is something equivalent to ((:TOP "Top" "More above" FONTS:TR12I)
					    (:BOTTOM "Bottom" "More below" FONTS:TR12I))

For flavor TV:LINE-AREA-TEXT-SCROLL-WINDOW:

:LINE-AREA-WIDTH   ;default 24.


For flavor TV:TYPEOUT-ITEM-WINDOW:

:ITEM-TYPE-ALIST
	alist of the item type, a default action for the left button, and menu alist
	for the right button's pop-up menu.
	  e.g. (FUNCTION-NAME EDIT-DEFINITION
			      ("Arglist" . TYPEOUT-MENU-ARGLIST)
			      ("Edit" . EDIT-DEFINITION))

For flavor TV:WINDOW-WITH-TYPEOUT:

:TYPEOUT-WINDOW   ;default NIL
    Can be a typeout window inferior to this one, or can be
    a list of the flavor and options of such a window to be created.


For flavor TV:DISPLAY-LAYOUT-WINDOW:

:NFROBS   ;default 0
	Number of rectangles to display initially


For flavor NZWEI:ZWEI:

:ZWEI-WINDOW
	The associated editor data structure, if you don't want a new
	one consed up.


For flavor NZWEI:ZWEI-WINDOW:

:ITEM-TYPE-ALIST
	This just defaults differently than the typeout window, used by it only.


For flavor NZWEI:ZMACS-WINDOW:

:PROCESS
	This is just to force BASIC-PROCESS, you wouldn't want to change it.
