_____This is a preliminary version of the Lisp Machine manual, describing
both the dialect of Lisp used by the Lisp Machine, and the software
environment of the Lisp Machine system.  Several chapters have
not been written, due to the early stage of the software they describe;
this includes chapters on Graphics, the Mouse, Menus, the Eine editor, the
network control program and higher level network programs, and the
file system.  Some of the chapters that are included describe software
that is still in a state of flux, and are likely to change drastically
in the next revision of this manual.
The authors also plan to produce a document describing
the internal formats of data objects and the instruction set of the
machine.

_____This version of the Lisp machine manual contains only minor editorial
corrections from the version of November, 1978.

_____Any comments, suggestions, or criticisms will be welcomed.
