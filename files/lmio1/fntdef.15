;If NIL then this character is not defined for this font.

					;character.  A left kern of -5 means the array is to
					;be placed 5 units to the right of the current position.
;NOTE: the CHAR-WIDTH is measured from the current position to the new position.
;the LEFT-KERN is not used in this computation therefore if the LEFT-KERN plus
;the width (second dimension) of the array is greater than the CHAR-WIDTH the
;character will overlap the next character on the line.
;A positive value of LEFT-KERN will cause the character to overlap the space of the
;last character.
