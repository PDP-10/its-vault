Two misc functions with trailing 16-bit parameters are used:
	*DISPATCH (argument on pdl)
	followed by maximum value, if greater or equal drop through.
		minimum value is always zero.
	followed by N PCs, which may as well be absolute
		(relative to the FEF) rather than self-ralative

	*SELECTQ (argument on pdl)
	followed by halfword whose 8 low bits are FEF-relative address
		of the start of an array of constants (by putting invz's
		in this array some forms of SELECT could be done but
		it's probably not worth it),
		and whose high 8 bits are N, the length of the array.
	followed by N PCs, which may as well be absolute
		(relative to the FEF) rather than self-relative.
		Each PC corresponds to one element of the constant array.

When these are put in DISPATCH and SELECTQ will have to cease to
be macros and the compiler will have to know about them.  Also LAP
will have to be changed a little to support PC tables.
