;READ-COMPARE-THING is analogous to XR-READ-THING.
;It is passed an object to compare and a stream to read from.
;The readtable finite state machine is used to gobble a string from the stream
;(using READ-COMPARE-STRING, which is reused each time).
;The final state of the FSM determines what function to call to
;compare the string (and perhaps more text which follows) with the object;
;except that some things are SPECIAL-TOKENs which just return
;the two values <token-name> and SPECIAL-TOKEN to the caller.
;In that case, nothing has been matched, and the caller must take special action.
;Sometimes we detect a read macro.  In that case, we return
;the function to call and READ-MACRO.  Normally, we (that is, the
;comparison function) return T for succesful match, or throw to READ-COMPARE.

;When a read macro is processed by our caller, it should be passed these
;arguments:  first, an object to match, if the macro is nonsplicing.
;Second, the list of the remaining objects to match, in case the
;macro is splicing.  Third, the stream.
;The macro handler returns two values.  The second is whether it was
;splicing.  The first, in the case that it was splicing,
;is the list of things not matched (a tail of the original second argument).
;If the macro doesn't match, it throws, so there is no need to worry about that.

;Splicing macros, and nonsplicing ones which "do consing",
;must watch for READ-COMPARE-STOP and throw if it is encountered.
