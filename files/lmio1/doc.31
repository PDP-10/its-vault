;;; A command (a COM- symbol) either has "smart" or "normal" handling of
;;; documentation.  All commands should have a COMMAND-NAME property, whose
;;; value is the nice-looking string form of the command's name.
;;; It should also have a DOCUMENTATION property, whose value is the
;;; string which is the full documentation.  If short documentation
;;; (the one-line kind produced by List Commands) is needed, it is just
;;; the first line of the full documentation.

;;; A command with "smart" handling is detected by the presence of
;;; a DOCUMENTATION-FUNCTION property.  The value of this property
;;; should be a function, which is called with three arguments:
;;;    First, the command symbol itself.
;;;    Secondly, the character typed to get this command, or NIL.  If the second
;;;       argument is NIL, that means that the caller does not have any particular
;;;       character in mind (e.g. in List Commands).  The documentation-function
;;;       should be prepared to deal with this case.
;;;    Thirdly, an operation which tells the function what to do.  They are:
;;;       :NAME  Return your name as a string, (e.g. "Self Insert")
;;;       :FULL  Type out full documentation to standard-output.
;;;       :SHORT Type out short documentation to standard-output.

;;; The symbols on the *COMMAND-HOOK* may also want to document
;;; themselves when the user asks for self-documentation.  Any hook
;;; which does should have an HOOK-DOCUMENTATION-FUNCTION property,
;;; whose value is a function of two arguments, the command which the
;;; hook is preceeding, and the character typed.  (The second argument
;;; will never be NIL.) This function will only be called on the user's
;;; request for FULL (not SHORT) documentation. The function should print
;;; out stuff to standard-output.  It may assume the cursor is at the left
;;; edge, and it should leave the cursor there.
