This file contains stuff removed from MSGCON.  It may or may not go into eventual
documentation.  Generally these are "internal" messages which the user doesn't need
either to send or to define methods for.

.section Screen manager

.defmessage :order-inferiors
Causes the inferiors to be ordered according to whether they are exposed and
their priority.
.end_defmessage

.defmessage :screen-manage &optional bound-rectangles array-to-draw-on (x 0) (y 0) alu
Causes "screen management" to happen on the window.  3bound-rectangles*, if non-3nil*,
is a list of sub-rectangles of the window in which to do screen management.
3array-to-draw-on*, 3x*, 3y*, and 3alu* are used for recursive calls, and
not specified at top-level.
.end_defmessage

.defmessage :screen-manage-autoexpose-inferiors
Causes any inferiors of the window which are completely uncovered to be sent 3:expose*
messages.  Also selects a window if no window is currently selected, and the
window this message is sent to is the 3mouse-sheet*.
.end_defmessage

.defmessage :screen-manage-deexposed-visibility
Returns 3t* if the window might be partially visible when deexposed, otherwise
returns 3nil*.
.end_defmessage

.defmessage :screen-manage-restore-area rects array x y alu
The areas of the window specified by the rectangles in 3rects* whose source is
the window, are copied onto 3array* with 3x* and 3y* offsets, and
3alu* as specified.  The rectangles thus handled are 3delq*'ed from the list,
and the new list is returned.
.end_defmessage

.defmessage :screen-manage-uncovered-area rects array x y alu
Similar to 3:screen-manage-restore-area*, but sent to the window actually
being screen managed, as opposed to its inferiors.
.end_defmessage

.section Frames

.defmessage :inferior-deexpose sheet

.end_defmessage

.defmessage :inferior-expose sheet
Sent to the superior of a pane when the pane is sent a 3:expose* message

.end_defmessage

.defmessage :inferior-set-edges sheet &rest ignore
Sent to the superior of a pane when the pane is sent a 3:set-edges* message
and the variable 3recursion*
