Macsyma also seems to be using:
cursorpos, charpos, listen.
The status calls it uses are:
_, terpri, gctime, interr, ttyint, tty, crfile, uread, memfree
Some of these only in oldio and others only in newio.
There is a version of suprv on my directory which is conditionalized
for lispm you might look at it and see if that sort of thing
will work.  That file is the one which will take the majority of the work.

Thus far I have found the following differences which will have to be 
accomadated somehow.
Macsyma needs SORT.  I thought MJF wrote one in lisp which wouldn't be bad.
We need catch, throw and errset.
I take it (catch a flag) is the same as (multiple-value (nil foo) (%catch flag a))?
We may have problems with get's on disembodied property lists I'm not sure.
There also may be problems with defun. i.e. macros and fexpr's are defined
this way.  Also we use lexpr's so something must be done there also.
*array and *rearray are used substantially in macsyma.
Some set of compatable status calls are needed.  I'm not sure just which
ones, I'll send you a list shortly.
Timeing routines are used (runtime) etc.
