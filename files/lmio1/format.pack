                  To reformat or rebuild a disk pack
                          (only for T-80's?)

First you must find two CADR's that can talk to each other over the debug umbilicus.
One machine will be used as the master, and will perform disk operations on
the slave machine.  The debug cable comes out of the board marked "BUSINT" which
is in slot 11.  It is plugged into J6 on the master end, and J5 on the slave end.
Remove the disk pack from the slave machine's disk and replace it with the
useless pack.

To reformat a disk pack:

(PKG-GOTO 'CADR)
(CC-LOAD-UCODE "LISPM1;DCFU")			;Source on MOON's directory
(CC)
^R
0@G
^P						;It should respond --RUN--
	;wait for this to finish, it takes several minutes
	;it should stop at "DONE", otherwise you've lost

(DCHECK)
(DC-WRITE-READ-TEST)				;ALL,ALL,ALL,ALL

(SI:EDIT-DISK-LABEL "CC" T)			;Initialize
						;You should comment as to who you are.
						;(Type ? for commands)

(SI:COPY-DISK-PARTITION 0 'LOD? "cc" 'LOD?)
(SI:COPY-DISK-PARTITION 0 'MCR? "cc" 'MCR?)
