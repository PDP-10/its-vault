This file contains an outline of the documentation needed before
the new window system can be installed.  In addition to documentation,
there should be a list of those loose ends in the system which must be
cleaned up before installation, and those which can be postponed.

Motivation for flavors -- can be postponed if necessary

How to use flavors

General philosophy of the window system -- overall organization,
	list of components, glossary of terms

Message dictionary -- lists all messages used, who is allowed to
	use them, what arguments they take, what values they return,
	and what they are supposed to do.  Needs to be both from
	the point of view of what messages you might want to send,
	and from the point of view of what messages the writer of
	a window flavor must implement.

	Complex conventions, like those having to do with exposing
	and those having to do with margins, might be documented
	here or they might be moved out into separate sections.

Flavor dictionary -- lists all flavors, what they do, what they are for.
	For each flavor lists its methods, and what they do.

Documentation of specific sections of the system.  There probably is
	not time to make full "program logic manuals", and not much
	need.  However, a general exposure of conventions and overall
	philosophy is needed for the following:
		text display
		graphics display
		screen management (expose/deexpose and screen manager)
		temporary windows
		the mouse
		menus
		[several more things to be enumerated later, e.g. scroll]

Operators manual -- this tells how to use the system, not how to
	program it.  This is mainly a list of ESC commands and other
	keyboard character conventions, descriptions of the overall
	conventions for the mouse, and documentation on the things
	you can get to from the system menu, particularly the screen
	layout editor.

Conversion Guide -- this doesn't have to be highly polished, as it will
	be thrown away after a few months.  It consists mainly of a list
	of all functions, variables, classes, and messages which are
	going away, and what to do if you were using them.

Debugging Hints -- useful tricks and suggestions for debugging code that uses
	the new window system.

Editor operators manual -- this can be postponed if necessary, but it should
	be done at some point.  Stuff which is not different from Emacs
	can be omitted, especially if RMS's new Emacs manual is any good.
