;Questionnaires.
;A questionnaire frame is a frame containing a bunch of questionnaire elements,
;which are windows containing a label and often a "value".  You can change the
;value with the mouse.  This is intended for displaying options to complicated
;programs and the like; it is a generalization of menus.
;
;The elements have names in the usual constraint-frame fashion.
;
;The following messages are special to questionnaire frames:
;They work by sending to the questionnaire elements
;	:ELEMENT-VALUE name
;	:SET-ELEMENT-VALUE name value
;	:ELEMENT-ACCENT name
;	:SET-ELEMENT-ACCENT name value
;	:BROADCAST message &rest args
;		Sends message to all elements.  This is useful
;		for various forms of resetting.
;	   Broadcasting the :QUESTIONNAIRE-RESET message resets all the state
;	:SEND-ELEMENT pane-name message args
;	:FIND-PANE name   (returns the pane [this doesn't belong here])
;
;Note that since a questionnaire frame has a bit save array, and its component
;questionnaire element panes do not, you can update them if the frame is
;de-exposed and they will automatically update in the bit save array,
;which is the right thing to avoid gratuitous-looking redisplay.  This also
;implies that all questionnaire panes need to know how to redisplay themselves
;without the aid of a bit-save array, e.g. when the pane configuration is changed.
;The ones in this file do so.
;
;If you want a function to get called when a questionnaire element is changed
;with the mouse, give it a :AFTER :MOUSE-BUTTONS method which looks at its
;VALUE and/or ACCENT instance variables.  This will do exactly the right thing.

;Trace window.  I am trying to get something which looks like this:
;
;			TRACE
;		       Function
;	Print
;	Break	   When	       Conditional
;	Step
;	Argpdl		   Form
;	Wherein
;	CANCEL		DO IT		UNTRACE
;
;Most of these are function-button type elements.  Function contains the name of the function
;to do.  When lets you choose between Before, After, and Before&After.
;Conditional is usually a trace conditional, if you select Print or Break
;it becomes a conditional just for that, if you select argpdl or wherein it
;is renamed and used to read the argument to those.
;Form shows the trace form being built up.
;CANCEL normally cancels the whole thing, when lit it cancels just the current
;operation that is waiting for arguments.

;Should this be a resource?
