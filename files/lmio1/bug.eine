When you have a mini window, being prompted for a select buffer name, 
accidentally typing a window command gets you a reasonable error message, 
but then hangs the machine til you reboot.
Do you still want EINE bug reports with the advent of ZWEI?

1) C-M-B does not understand quoted parens.
Try moving back over (GTYO /().
2) When I do C-X C-W on a buffer which is connected to a file
and which has been modified, it asks me whether to write the changes
back into the file it was previously connected to.
But the point of using C-X C-W is to change the name.

The ^XO bug has been fixed.

If you try to do ^XO in the minibuffer, however,
it screws up and leaves no window selected.
This is the fault of ED-CHECK-TOP-LEVEL.

  I HAD A BUFFER IN EINE WITH A MACRO IN IT.  DISPLAYED BY EINE SAID SI (WHICH
WAS WHAT I HAD INTENDED).  PREVIOUSLY, BY ACCIDENT, I HAD LOADED THE FILE INTO
USER AS WELL.
  THEN COMPILING FROM THE BUFFER WITH A NEW DEFINITION OF THE MACRO 
(WHICH WAS DEFINED WITH DEFMACRO) INSISTED ON REDEFINING THE VERSION IN USER
PACKAGE INSTEAD OF THE ONE IN SI.

It is impossible for anyone to change any of the editor's
parameters that are used at initialization, because initialization
insists on clobbering them back to the default state before using them.
It is necessary to copy the entire initialization functions.

I noticed that C-X C-B was terribly slow, and figured out
that it has to swap in the entire contents of all buffers
in order to see how recently the buffer was munged.
The only way to avoid this problem appears to be to
store this information in the buffer itself.
Can anything be done about this in Zwei?

Along the same lines, it would seem that when comparing two
bps in Zwei it will be necessary to swap in the entire contents
of the text between them (and an equal amount afterward).
This could be avoided by keeping a list of lines
instead of linking the lines through the lines themselves.
This could be done without any extra storage by
making each line point to the link in the list that points
to the previous line, instead of pointing to the next and
previous lines.  The first line in a chain would point with
a locative to the place where the list lived.
This would make a few basic operations ugly but that could
be hidden.  Alternatively, the list could be in addition to
the chain.  This would cost two more words per line, though.
The goal in either case would be to store the list in a different
place from the lines so that the list would occupy fewer pages.

C-M-H does not include the CRLF after the function before the mark.
C-M-E is fooled terribly by comments between functions
that contain parentheses.  It stops on the line after such a comment line
and stays there when typed repeatedly.  If the pointer is anywhere after
such a line but before the "(" starting the next defun, then C-M-E
moves back to that fixed point.
M-L, M-U and M-C with negative arguments do not work as in EMACS.
M-Form ought to insert a Form.

It is a loss that Kill File on a section file with modified sections
asks me, for each modified section, whether I want to write the file.
It should ask only once, unless it learns how to write single sections.
This is a real screw because I have to do a Kill File after each ^X^S.

But at the moment even that doesn't appear to be safe, since ^X^S seems
to have truncated 5 characters off the end of the file and I believe
that it was the first time I ^X^S'd that file.
So I have gone back to whole-file editing.

Meanwhile, for M-Z to clear the screen is totally wrong,
since that is a time at which one certainly does not want to lose the info.

While editing a file on the lisp machine, it was modified on the 10.
We then attempted to read in a function, not previously edited on the lisp machine,
from the same file using meta-dot.  The editor politely informed us that we had indeed
modified it on the 10, told us that it was going to forget about the file, and then
killed the buffer were in, but not all the buffers associated with the file.

Bug #1:	EINE shouldn't ask us what buffer to go to at this point, since no matter
	what, meta-dot will put us in a buffer of its chosing after the function
	is read in.

Bug #2:	Even though it recognized that the file had been modified, it read in the
	function from its position in the old file rather than finding the positions
	of the functions over again.

Bug #3:	Actually, it shouldn't kill the buffer we are currently in when reading
	the function in.  Fixing this bug would also fix bug #1.

If a Forget File is done by hand before doing the meta-dot, the right thing happens.

I have a suspicion that this is a result of what is trying to
