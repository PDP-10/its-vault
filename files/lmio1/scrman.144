;;; The screen manager, an unseen entity that many have cursed and
;;; many have praised, is herewithin presented for all to see.

;;; Priorities:
;;; Each sheet has a priority (which is basically how hard it tries to be on the screen).
;;; The priorities are used for ordering the list of inferiors of a sheet, and therefore
;;; affect what windows the mouse sees, how the screen manager works, and how the automatic
;;; exposing decides what to expose.  If the priority is null, then it is considered
;;; to have a priority smaller than that of any with explicit priorities (this includes
;;; negative priorities, but that doesn't really matter).  Positive priorities mean an
;;; absolute priority as compared to all other sheets with a numerical priority -- namely,
;;; the larger the number, the more important the sheet is considered to be.  A negative
;;; priority indicates that the sheet is to be considered "inactive" by various routines
;;; when it is not exposed.  -1 means only be considered inactive by the screen manager,
;;; and -2 or less means don't even be a candidate for auto-exposure.  Exposed sheets
;;; are always uncovered, and therefore are guaranteed to have the largest priority
;;; (virtually, and since they don't overlap, all exposed sheets are considered the same).

;;; Notes: A set of rectangles is a list of rectangles.  All functions that
;;; operate on sets expect them in the canonical form (a list of rectangles
;;; that don't mutually overlap).  All user-level functions that return sets
;;; canonicalize them first.

;;; A rectangle is a four-list of (SOURCE LEFT TOP RIGHT BOTTOM)
;;; SOURCE where the rectangle came from.  Rectangles cannot have
;;; their LEFT, TOP, RIGHT, or BOTTOM destructively altered.
