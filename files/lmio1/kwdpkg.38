;;; Keywords used by Lisp machine system functions.
;;; For now, these are in the system package as well as the keywords package.
;;; NOTE: Things which really want to be global DON'T go in this file, they go in GLOBAL

;;; Some things used to be in this file due to problems with the cold-load
;;; generator which no longer exist.  The remaining things in this file are
;;; for Maclisp compatibility, which prevents users from putting colons
;;; in front of their keywords.

;;; EACH SYMBOL NAME MUST BE PRECEDED BY A SPACE!!!
