	Input/Output on the LISP Machine

How to perform I/O on the LISP Machine:

	The fundamental unit for I/O is the "File object."  It is
the link between the LISP world and the outside.  To perform I/O:
 Create a file block.
 Open the file block.
 Initialize the file block.
 Allocate storage for the file block.
 Set the status of the file block.
 Initiate the file block.
 Activate the file block.

 Create a device interface block.
 Open the device interface block
 Initialize the device interface block.
 Allocate storage for the device interface block.
 Set the status of the device interface block.
 Initiate the device interface block.
 Activate the device interface block.

 Create an active link to the virtual device.
 Open the link.
 Initialize the link.
 Activate the link.

 Link the link to the device interface block.
 Send the device interface block the standard device initialization values.
 Connect the file block to the device interface block.
 Send a %%QBBHDTB-START-INITIALIZATION-SEQUENCE protocol
	block to the file block.
 Wait for a %%QBBHDTB-START-INITIALIZATION-SEQUENCE-POSIIVE-ACKNOWLEDGE
	response from the file block.
 Send the %%QBBHDTB-REQUEST-FOR-TRANSFER block to the file block,
	including all information on the nature, priority, sensitivity,
	security status, allocation parameters, mean size, maximum size, etc,
	of the transfer.
 Wait for the standard %%QBBHDTB-REQUEST-FOR-TRANSFER-POSITIVE-ACKNOWLEDGE
	block, and reconfirm all parameters.
 Send the %%QBBHDTB-CIA-DATA-SPY-CHECK command
	[charges for this command are paid, courtesy Acme Paper Clip Company,
		Juarez, Mexico.  Holders of diplomatic passports from other
		countries should make special arrangements with their
		account representative]
 Send the %%QBBHDTB-COMMENCE-TRANSFER protocol message to the file block.
 Wait for the standard %%QBBHDTB-COMMENCE-TRANSFER-COMMENCEMENT-COMPLETE
	protocol signal which signifies that the transfer has begun.
 Wait for the %%QBBHDTB-THAT'S-ALL-FOLKS standard protocol message signifying
	the completion of the transfer.

 Disconnect the file block from the device interface block.
 Unlink the link from the device interface block.

 Deactivate the link.
 Finalize the link.
 Close the link.
 Deallocate the link.

 Deactivate the device interface block.
 Deallocate the device interface block
 Finalize the device interface block.
 Close the device interface block.
 Return the device interface block
 Flush the device interface block.

 Deactivate the file object.
 Deallocate the file object
 Finalize the file object.
 Close the file object.
 Return the file object
 Flush the file object.
