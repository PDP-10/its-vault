766140 - 766176   CADR XBUS<-> UNIBUS mapping registers
        These map UNIBUS addresses 140000-177777.
	Bits are valid, write-enable, page.  If high 5 bits of page=1, writes MD register.

				are merely suggestions):

XBUS ADDRESSES (note: addresses here given in 24 bit form as on next machine.
   on current machine, the high bit must always be 0)

0          -    400000     real core

76,,776000 - 76,,777777    mapped to A memory locations 0-1777 by microcode.
			   (only 0-377 exist on current machine)
77,,000000 - 77,,377777    Xbus IO space.  see below for further breakdown
77,,400000 - 77,,777777    mapped to Unibus.   Each Xbus address is mapped to
			   one 16 bit Unibus location.


XBUS IO space (octant 6 of the XBUS)

Current XBUS physical address assignments
  
17,,000000 to 17,,077777	Main TV screen
17,,100000 to 17,,107777	Convolution box (offsets described below)
17,,110000 to 17,,110017	Scheme chip interface (offsets described below)
17,,140000 to 17,,177777	Audio i/o memory
17,,200000 to 17,,277777	Color TV
17,,377600 to 17,,377677	Vision hardware control
17,,377740 to 17,,377747	Audio i/o control registers
17,,377750 to 17,,377757	Color TV control
17,,377760 to 17,,377767	Main TV control
17,,377770 to 17,,377773	Second disk control
17,,377774 to 17,,377777	Disk control

Note: octant 7 of the XBUS cannot be accessed by the Lisp Machine,
because those physical addresses are mapped to the unibus.

Scheme chip interface registers:
00	RW	Clock duration -  Delay 1
01	RW	Clock duration - Phase 2
02	RW	Clock duration - Delay 2
03	RW	Clock duration - Phase 1
04	RW	Write: Map address (for examine/deposit)
		Read: Memory address chip last referenced
05	RW	Map data (addressed by Map Address register)
06	RW	Control
		Bit	RW	Function
		0	 W	Reset
		1	RW	Run (turns on/off clock, clock registers should not
				     be changed with run on)
		2	RW	External freeze (freezes chip, does not stop clock)
		3	R	Chip is frozen
		4	R	NXM (cleared by reset or mem start)
		5	R	Parity error (cleared by reset or mem start)
		6	R	Invalid map location addressed (cleared by reset or mem start)
		7	RW	Freeze on error (causes chip to be frozen when one of
						  above conditions is true)
		8	RW	Freeze on GC (freeze when GC interrupt is set)
		9	R	GC Needed
		10	R	GC interrupt in progress
		11	R	External interrupt request
		12	R	External interrupt in progress
		13	R	Single stepping in progress
		14	RW	Read: Read request in progress
				Write: Mem restart (writing a 1 restarts the Scheme chip
				after a failing memory cycle.  LISPM should have
				looked at the write data for a write, or stored
				the read data for a read)
		15	R	State hacking (reading or writing) in progress
		16	R	Chip read signal (chip is waiting for a memory cycle)
		17	R	Chip write signal (chip is starting a write)
		18	R	Chip cdr (whether current memory cycle is a car or a cdr)
		19	R	Chip is reading interrupt vector
		20	R	GC Needed
		21	R	Chip address latch enable
		22	R	Memory freeze -- chip is waiting for a memory cycle
07	RW	Single Step (single steps chip up to 256 times, only useful when Force Freeze
			     is set and RUN is on)
		Reading reads the current state of the counter.  Useful if froze due to
		memory cycle
10	RW	Reading reads latched state, writing causes state to be latched at
		next convenient time
11	RW	Int Vector
12	RW	GC vector (vector sent to chip for GC interrupt)
13	 W	Loads new state into chip
14	RW	Memory data
15	 W	Clears external interrupt request, data is ignored
16	 W	Writing causes an external interrupt
