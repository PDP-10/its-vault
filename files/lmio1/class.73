;a CLASS-SYMBOL is the name by which the user refers to the class.  It usually
;	has a -CLASS suffix.  Its value is
;       a DTP-ENTITY which is an instance of CLASS-CLASS.  Instances of CLASS-CLASS
;       contain a NAME, a CLASS-SYMBOL, and a CLASS-METHOD-SYMBOL (and some others
;	as well).  The NAME is used for printing out, and usually does not contain
;	the -CLASS suffix.
;an INSTANCE is a closure of some INSTANCE-VARIABLES and whose functional
;	component is a CLASS-METHOD-SYMBOL.
;a CLASS-METHOD-SYMBOL is usually a gensym created at class definition time.
;   The value of the CLASS-METHOD-SYMBOL is a DTP-ENTITY which is an instance of
;       CLASS-CLASS.  This is initially the identical instance which is in the
;	value cell of the CLASS-SYMBOL, however, if the class is redefined
;	(ie a new DEFCLASS done), the CLASS-SYMBOL will change, while the
;	current CLASS-METHOD-SYMBOL will not change, and instead a new one will be made.
;   The function cell of the CLASS-METHOD-SYMBOL is a DTP-SELECT-METHOD which holds
;       the methods of the class.

;When DEFCLASS is done, a new CLASS-METHOD-SYMBOL is always created.  Any instances
;of the old class will be unaffected since they close over the old CLASS-METHOD-SYMBOL.
;The system attempts to alter the NAME of the old class so the user will
;be warned if he has one of these floating around.

;  Methods can be defined local to a  particular instance (as opposed to its class)
;by DEFMETHOD-INSTANCE.  However, it is assumed to be fairly rare to want to do this,
;and we dont want to garbage up all instances on this account.  
; Accordingly, the first time this is
;done for a particular instance, a phantom CLASS is created which is a subclass
;of the original class.  The instance is then transmuted to the phantom class.
;Phantom classes have the :PHANTOM-CLASS property on the property list of the
;CLASS-METHOD-SYMBOL (for extra connectedness, the value of this property is the
;instance).

;With this new scheme, LISP-OBJECT-CLASS can eventually be flushed in favor of
; regular instances of CLASS-CLASS with special NEW methods.

;A CLASS is held on a lisp symbol, specially created for the purpose.
;  The function cell of the symbol contains the DTP-SELECT-METHOD for the class.
