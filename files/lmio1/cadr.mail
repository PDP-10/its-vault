since latanya is starting to succeed at getting her purchs system to work,
the whiteboard in 936 should no longer be used for listing parts that we
lack. parts that are low or not here should be reported to purchs@ai;
i believe the correct format for this is
:mail purchs
part-needed:<whatever it is>
when-needed:<if they are needed for otherwise-stuffed boards, yesterday,
	else a reasonable estimate of how soon they willbe needed for boards>
needed-for:<what boards, either specific ones or general types>
qty-needed:<for the remainder of this build, which is through cadr20;
	over-estimating slightly is probably a good idea>
note:<anything which doesn't fit into the previous categories and is
	something latanya or whoever else handling parts ordering should know>

(latanya, plz correct me if i'm wrong).
or use the purchs system on a cadr; it has a user-assist facility.

Winning Ways to get Purchase Parts

Any of the following will get parts ordered:

	(1)  Run PURCHS on a Lisp Machine.
	     Report the part as being needed.  (User assist is available.)

	(2)  Send mail to PURCHS 
	     The mail should specify what the part is needed-for,  
	     date-needed, and qty-needed. 
	     (This information is as important as giving the name of the part.)

	(3)  Append report of the part to AI:PURCHS;PARTS NEEDED
	     BE SURE TO USE THE CORRECT FORMAT!!
	     This is the data file used by PURCHS.

To inquire on the progress of a order,  use PURCHS.
(Or,  send mail to PURCHS)

Using the above methods will also build up the data files associated with PURCHS,
causing more and more winnage (a spiral result).



P.S.    Relying on the board in 936 to get parts ordered is not advisable.
The board does not provide enough information to be a reliable source from which to
order parts.  It does not tell date reported,  when needed,  how many,  or for what.  
It also generates more work since the board has to be updated, etc.
So to eliminate these problems do not rely on the board.

Subject: chaosnet transceiver problems
To: CADR at MIT-AI

The chasnet transceiver problems people have been reporting are due to an incorrect
resistor value in the transmit termination for the lisp machine to transceiver path.
Currently, there is a 2.2K pullup/pulldown pair with a 180 ohm cross termination.
These should be changed to 470 ohm pullup/pulldowns, with a 300 ohm cross termination.
This change involves three resistors per transceiver, and should permanently solve
the powerdown problem we have been experiencing.  The difficulty involves the threshold
for the 26LS32 differential receiver, which can be as much as + or - .2 volts off from
zero.  I will try to talk with Laurel about retrofitting the existing transceivers as
soon as possible.

Danny's tool box was kept in room 918,  the AI stock room,  the usually locked
AI stock room.  This room also contains Levitt's music system,  the chord keyboard,
drafting equipment,  and a Lisp Machine terminal.  We can not afford to have
such random behavior occurring in this area.

So, please BEWARE of RANDOMS.

MOON@MIT-MC 09/16/80 16:25:28 Re: Chaosnet transceivers
To: cadr at MIT-AI
There is a problem with Chaosnet transceivers, manifesting itself
as the network not working well when a machine is powered off.
The problem is that the transmit lines from the interface to the transceiver
have to be actively driven into the idle state; if a long cable is
connected to a transciever, with either a powered-off machine or
nothing at the other end, noise will cause random transmission onto
the cable, apparently of a type which does not trigger the error-detection
logic.  Could someone (perhaps JLK) who understands the transceiver
circuitry determine if a small modification could be made to correct
this?  (Or, even better, inform me that it is already fixed in the new
batch of transceivers and we just need to flush the old ones!)

Purchase System  Parts List

Thanx for your help with the parts list.  

The new corrected version is now installed.  
I would appreciate your help in checking it over.

It's Dover version is--  ai:purchs;make mach

To see the parts lists via the Purchase System itself,
	on a Lisp Machine  (not on AI yet)
	(load "ai:purchs;start qfasl")
	create the package PURCHS
	(pkg-goto 'purchs)	
	(batch-load)	<-- loads lots of qfasls
	(start)		<-- starts purchase system
	
	The purchase system refers to parts lists as "compositions".
	Enjoy.  Any comments or suggestions are welcome.

	If an error occurs, the function  (restart)  will restart purchase system
	keeping the old data enviroment.  (Keeps from reloading data files.)	



P.S.
The previous parts lists were generated by a program 
which operated on a file containing a table of parts.  
Both the program and the file were wrong,  causing gross lossage.

The new version was generated from the actual stuff files of the components.

re: state of things

   (1)  The problem of T-80s overloading the wall strip has
      been solved by making an adaptor so they can be run off
      the twist lock outlet on the power box.  CADRs 13 and 14
      have these adaptors.  All CADRs with T-80s really should
      be retrofitted, since running it all off one plug is more
      winning anyway.  In specific, adaptors for CADRs 10 and 11
      should be ready soon.
   (2)  Then console cables now make it to the machine room.  All
      thats needed now is to bring them under the false floor and
      install connectors and repeaters.
   (3)  The false floor that needs to be removed is near the RP06's.
      Because of the inordinate amount of cruft that issues forth
      when the false floor is removed,  the RP06's should be off
      at the time.  Late tonight sounds like a good time to do this.

CADR 13 and 14 are installed and both seem to work.
CADR 14 has gotten a few main memory parity errors
losing bits in transmission from memory (ie the MD and
memory wind up different) that need to be looked into.

One problem: the wall strip we are using to power the disks
is overloaded and trips its circuit breaker if you try to power
up all 4 disks!  For now, you get your choice which 3 machines
you want to hack.  The right solution is for the disk drive
to get its power from the white twist lock connector on the power
box adjacent to the input power connector.  To do this we need to make
up some appropriate adaptors (I think there may be some around).
That way, each disk will get power from the same place its machine does
which is clearly a win.

notes:
  (1) the cable in CADR14 from 4BJ1 to 5BJ1 is marginal
      and should be replaced.
  (2) DC 11, now in CADR14, loses in a very mysterious way
      if you use it to format a disk. (this caused our problems
      of last night).  The clock timing of both disk controls
      should be rechecked since this is a known trouble spot.
  (3) The AI lab has contributed a couple of push on probe tips
      to the Dept's scope.  The Dept is very appreciative.
  (4) I made up some prints that were missing from the Dept's
      documentation.  After that, I noticed that the CMEM prints
      in the Dept's book are for CADR-1 and show 93471's instead
      of 2147's!.  Losey losey.  Clearly, they need to be remade.
  (5) Disk EE3, now in CADR13, has a bad spot in band 1.
      It gets an ECC correctable error consistantly there.  I guess
      we need to make things use ECC.  Until that, that disk has
      two usable bands.

        When CADR-3 gets powered off while its transceiver is still powered on,

        I haven't localized it yet to the interface or the transceiver.
     
 I have seen this happen with Cadr-2 as well. People should check for such

cadrs 15 and 16 are in a similar state: stuffed and interior cabled and
somewhat tested. they need further debugging, and disks, consoles, and
tranceivers, and cables to same. i think they also need memory and
possibly tv boards.
cadr 17 is mostly stuffed and on a bay. it is much farther back in 
construction; its stuffing and backplane have to be checked, it has no

Its major task is ordering and processing parts for the next build.  To do this,
it must utilize the following information:   (1) parts of a Lisp Machine, 
(2) qty of goods in stock,  and,  (3) state of the cadrs in the current build.  
Based on this information,  requisitions will be sent to MIT purchasing for the parts
needed to complete this build and the next.  Your assistance is needed to qualify this
information.

Parts of a Lisp Machine.  
The composition of a Lisp Machine,  as processsed from the purchase system,  is in the
file  "ai:ty;make mach"   Please assist in making sure this list of parts is accurate.
(This file is formatted for dovering.)  Send comments and updates via mail to PURCHS.

Qty of goods in stock.
ICs have been counted and sorted.  (Thanx Cent!)   However,  many products such as cable,
and unknown frobs,  etc,  are not included in the composition list,  mentioned above.
The system needs to know what "gray things" and "little guys" are and how many are needed.
Please help identify them.  
The qty of products,  such as boards,  keyboards,  and monitors,  that are on-order or
just-arrived needs to be included in this knowledge.

State of Current Build.
As of Monday,  August 25,  what is the state of cadrs 15-20?  I will spend monday looking
them over for obvious parts,  however,  your input is welcome.

To: (BUG HARDWARE) at MIT-AI

someone has used our entire store of 25pin bluemacs connectors to
make chaos cables to run between cadrs and their chaosnet interfaces.
this is fine, EXCEPT that all the cables are about 10 feet long, which
is a gross loss: sometimes the cables can be that short, but often
they must be significantly longer. whoever made these cables, probably
attempting to be considerate and forethoughtful, had his/her heart in
the right place, but has severely limited our capability to make
cables the right length.  
[in point of fact, these cables are made such that a succession of
them can be plugged end-to-end to create a longer cable, and that may
well be done as a kludge fix. but this is both wasteful of the 
connectors, which i understand are expensive, and subject to more
potential lossage.]
[latanya, could you order more of these connectors; we can use either
the AMP black ones or the 3M Bluemacs ones, but they are not compatible
with each other, as the amp ones ignore a wire in the middle, but for 
the 3m ones you cut a wire off one side of the cable.]

Sometimes it won't come ready (though the exerciseer claims no errors), sometimes
you can persuade to come ready using DCHECK or some other torture, but you
can never get it to boot.  Frequently seeing DSK OVERRUN, seldom seeing actual 
faults with the disk (once you get it ready.)  Too burnt and defeated to do anything

Well, Cadr6 has done it again.  I am much too burned out to debug
it, though I have left a scope hanging off of it:
When running at full speed, it doesn't write the map correctly.
Seems to pick bits 12 and 13 sometimes, in the 2nd level map.
Of course, powering it on/off changed the symptoms, so now it just
looks like it doesn't write it correctly.  Of course, all the write
pulese look fine.  Oh well, this one's been with us for a long time,

The speed change on the network has solved the long-standing lossage with
running the Gould over the network, namely the error rate of 1 in 10 packets
has been reduced over 1 in 1000 packets.  The lost-due-to-slowness count
(i.e. the receiving 11 could not keep up) has gone up significantly, but
that is likely due to the fact that the unibus-read-out speed-up mod has
not been put into most of the quad boards yet (with the exception of EE and
SPEECH).  This could also possibly explain the apparent increase in transmit
aborts we are seeing.  The remaining quad boards will be modified tomorrow.
(ALL IOB's have the packet buffer read/write speedup fix already)

machine has reached the point where it is dependent on the debugger to keep

Subject: Chaosnet Scheme(s)
To: CADR at MIT-AI
CC: CPR at MIT-AI, JIS at MIT-AI

(I was tempted to make some punful analogies, but resisted for your sakes...)

It is important that the Chaosnet be reliable, so my feeling is that we should
implement several proposed changes, even though we can not establish
conclusively that they will make a big difference, the theory being that a
collection of small reliability problems can combine to form a larger one
without there being a single obvious cause.

1.  Transceiver checkout.  Fred is going to check out the new transceivers with
an active test (with pulse generator and scope).  His idea is to eventually
recycle all the old ones and check them out similarly.

2. Network speed.  I guess the network speed will be changed to 4 MHz (in fact,
it may already be done by the time you read this).

3. Cable reconfiguration.  I think it is time to have 545 TS on a separate
cable from the campus part of the world.  This may or may not result in
improved propagation on the cable, but it will at least segment the world into
relatively large chunks with the feature that any cable problem will only
affect some fraction of the world, and not the whole (local) universe.  I
suggest the following plan:

AI and MC (IO-11s) will be gateways between the 545 cable and the Campus Link
cable.  To implement this scheme, we will first put second interfaces into both
these machines and connect a cable between them.  After the software has been
checked out, and tested by disconnecting these machines (one at a time!) from
the primary cable, and after a new piece of cable has been installed between
the basement and the 5th floor, then a moby change will take place where (1)
the Campus Link cable will run from the basement to the 5th floor to MC to AI
(and terminate there); (2) the 545 cable will start on the 3rd floor
(terminated) and end up at AI.  This will require a minor amount of
cable connecting and a major effort in changing host addresses in hardware
and software.

I will hassle generating the interfaces and the cables (optimistically, in the
next few days) and presumably Moon will hassle the IO-11 software.  Then the
changeover of host addresses will somehow have to be accomplished on a weekend
sometime.

4. Since the cable interconnect at MC seems to be marginal, I suggest moving
the CADR 3 & 5 transceivers in by the Mini-robot transceiver.  Again, it may
not make a big difference, but it can't hurt and is not much work.

5. Cable checkout.  Once the reconfiguration is done, we should checkout the
cables again with a TDR.  RG and I have agreed to split the cost of some new
equipment for this (CPR has offered to request to the EE dept to contribute
to this also).  Do I hear any volunteers to look into what we should buy
and perhaps hassle putting together a maintenance kit of tools, connectors,
equipment etc. for the official Chaosnet maintenance cabinet?  Maybe we
really want 2 such kits, one for 545 TS, and one to be kept in the EE dept
computer room (except for major equipment which would still reside in 545).

Comments?  Offers of assistance?

re: main memory parity errors on CADR-9

  Memory board serial #1 on cadr-9 has occasionally
getting parity errors in bunches.  In one instance I
looked at, there were a total of over 500 parity errors.
Doing cc-parity-sweep-info, the errors were concentrated
in various bits, which changed at sector boundaries.
I.e. in the high quarter, bits 9, 12, and 22 frequently lost,
in the next quarter, bit 30, etc.  This suggests to me that
maybe its some sort of refresh problem, and these are just the chips
which lose first when not refreshed.
  I checked the wiring on the control print, and found
all ECOs were OK.
  The crufty bus strips were fairly close to shorting, so
I bent them out.
  I checked the output from the crystal, which was OK.
If this problem continues, I guess we will have to start replacing
components in the timing section to try to find the marginal
component.

  In answer to your questions: 

PROSPECTIVE ASSEMBLY PLACE:
 Control Technology Corp.  82 Turnpike Rd. Westboro Mass. 01581 (617-366-9668)

COST: Their initial cost estimate is $90 to $120.  The low end does
not include stuffing the dips into the sockets, the high end does,
though this is not the only variable.

TIME FRAME/TRIAL:
 The turn around is approx 3 weeks, perhaps 2 weeks for just a couple
of boards. I would like to have them do the two remaining multiwire
boards (or at least one) so we can get a feel for their capacity for
dealing with the task. They seem to know what they are doing and there
was evidence of other multiwire orders out there.  (there weren't any
which had been through the wave solder machine though - these had all
been shipped already.) We would like to try them on a couple boards,
giving them the boards and parts (including dips) along with detailed
stuffing instructions. At first anyway, we will install the switches,
SIP, dummies, and crystal after we get the boards back.  These parts
will all be soldered directly to reduce height and will be done after
the rest to avoid their exposure to degreaser.

SOCKETS:
 Either the individual pin sockets or the black ones are OK. (no cost
difference) They made the point that the individual pin ones dissipate
heat better and guarantee better contact, but we plan to use the black
ones as they are cheaper and completely adequate for the application.
(No difference with regard to stuffing cost or soldering difficulty.)
Arrival of 20 pin sockets at MIT would allow the process to be
started.

CAPACITORS:
  They do not care here. There is one more step, and hence slightly
more bucks to stuff the long lead ones. We plan to use the .1uF dip
capacitors and the .47uF long lead ones. This is in hopes of avoiding
confusion between the two values during assembly since otherwise they
look so much the same.

PROGNOSIS ON MORE MULTIWIRE:
  The artwork will be retrieved tomorrow , examined and probably sent off to
Circuitech with errors/changes marked. They claim to be able to win with
the capacitor pad tolerance problem and will get revised artwork back to us
about one week following their receiving the current version back. If we
like this then it will take them another six weeks to get the next batch
of boards to us. (This is 2 weeks to "format" the artwork and 4 weeks to
produce the boards.) Depending on the degree we think they are winning we may 
or may not do another small test run instead of a huge run. Kulp was talking
of sending out some more wirewrap memory boards in the interim.

That's the story as of now. -- Taft

someone attempted to do the handwiring and ecos to the next DC to be
stuffed (it will be DC #16) (handwirng after the boards return from 
the factory and the ECOs are two separate things for DCs, i have
never fathomed why.). while doing this the person apparently broke
or mistakenly removed two of the blue (machine-wrapped) wires. he
corrected this by replacing the wires, in blue even, but put them on
over the handwiring. one of these wires was also connected to the
wrong pin at one end. one of the handwires was missing altogether 
from the board, and the wiring for the replaced wires, the 
handwiring, and the ECOs was sloppy and very poorly done. also, part
of the eco wiring was put in over rather than under the handwiring.

This last is the only item that i will not fault the unknown wirer for;
i was not quite sure myself until i checked with moon that indeed the
handwiring was supposed to be above the regular wiring on the board,
which includes the ECOs. i have entirely redone the handwiring and
ECOs on that board.

i realize that people want to be helpful about producing boards, but
it doesn't do any good if it isn't done right. if you eager beavers
are not going to take the proper care when doing wiring, don't do it;
if it's needed soon (where soon is construed to include yesterday)
tell me, and i will give it priority.  if i hadn't checked the wiring
on that board, somone debugging it might have had a hell of a time
trying to find the error.

also, someone who produced the latest copy of the DC prints (pictures,
WLS, etc.) bound into it a then-current copy of the DC ECOs. this
person also managed to shuffle pages so that the first page of the
ECO list was somewhere in the middle, while the second and third pages
were in front. please don't do this; ECO files are active objects
which get updated not infrequently, so binding a copy into a set of
prints only can cause confusion. the eco files live online, and 
hardcopies of the latest versions reside in my desk (right next to
the file cabinet where the prints live), which should make them 
accessible enough for anyone who wants them.

  I left the debugging-kludge/power-control operating on CADR-12. In fact at this
stage it must be left plugged in so that the power relays are set correctly. (There
will eventually be an override switch.) I also left its debug cable plugged into
the interface, there are no adverse effects if this gets removed to use the two machine
lash up. I would like to know if it appears that the debugging kludge in any way
crashes the CADR. It shouldn't.

CC: CADR at MIT-AI, USER-ACCOUNTS at MIT-MC


    At about 9AM this morning after having been working alone on the ninth floor
for several hours, I realized that a tourist named BLOTTO was also on the floor
and had not been there all night. I was working in 906 and vaguely remembered him
entering the lab a little earlier unaccompanied. At that point two other people
were on the floor neither of whom had let him in.  I confronted him and asked him
how he had gotten in, he claimed that he had no key and that the door had been
open. He claimed that this was often the case and attempted to demonstrate this
for me on the door nearest the 9th floor lounge.  The door was not open and did
not appear at all prone to sticking in the open position. I guess I feel that he
probably has a key and being that he does not claim to be associated with the lab
or MIT (he appears about freshman age) I don't think this is too cool. In
particular I didn't feel too comfortable about being responsible for his presence
on the floor. I did not ask him to leave, but soon after I confronted him he did
so. His use of the system appeared pretty marginal and fairly sophisticated, at
the time I decided to confront him he had just been supduping to MC, logged in
there under the UNAME of DLR and was hacking the games program.

    After spending quite some time beating down one bug in CADR-12 there
is yet another which remains. Occasionally the machine's X-BUS dies (and
hence the machine doesn't do too much) with the symptoms that it will run
CC-TEST-MACHINE completely except for CC-TEST-BUSINT-BUFFERS or something
like that, which fails completely. For instance any attempts to access memory
return completely random and inconsistent gubbish. This almost always
goes away after powering down the machine and unplugging the BUSINT and
plugging it back in again (or placing it on an extender.) I will be playing
with that machine some more as I get into debugging the debugging kludge
but am not sure if I will get in much before leaving early Friday morning

Just some folklore about chaosnet transceivers: in debugging several
transceivers the other day, I discovered that if a transceiver can talk to
several hosts near by but can't not reach faraway hosts, this is often a
symptom of the optoisolators being marginal.  In fact about 1/2 of all new
optoisolators are not up to performing at 8 MHz (lets hear it for 5.35 MHz
operation...).  The optoisolator used for the interference signal is not
critical, so marginal ones should be used there rather than discarded (I
believe they are fairly expensive).

due to some obscure lossage which rg claims tk is responsible for,

those sections are 50 pins long, but the connectors which attach to
them are 40 pins long. i have had to remove (or partially remove)
10 pins on each of those sections; a fair amount of metal shavings
was produced and fell into the icmem boards wiring, which may cause
all sorts of problems when the machines are brought up.

previous machines have had these pins removed (or never put in) i

thus avoiding the problem.

making entries is self-explanatory; just copy the style of entries already

100 82S21s appeared today, which added to the 40 (i think) that arrived
a week or so ago will fill the immediate need for them. we still need
another hundred or so to complete all machines of this build. also, we
got 100 ft of 20wire ribbon cable.
we have been declared (by tk and moon) to not need 9S42s in almost anything
anymore, and we have forty or fifty of them now, so we shouldn't worry
about getting more.

    Yes, the IOB has 6 25LS193's which specifically need to be 25LS193's.
    They will work with most 74LS193's, but not with slow 74LS193's which
    are within the range legally allowed.  The 25LS193 is essentially the
    same part except the guaranteed speed is faster.  (It is also made with
    a different process, but we don't care about that.)

the 25LS193s and 74LS193s have been separated into their respective drawers
in the 936 parts cabinets. it should be noted that they are GENERALLY 
interchangeable, but on at least one board (iob i think) the differences are
critical enough that some positions are much more marginal with the 74, and
thus require the 25.
rg or someone else should tell andy love to use the 74LS except when there
are none or when the 25LS are specifically required.

also, stripped the MK#3 board.

To: CADR at MIT-AI

tk has pointed out that the current figures on 9s42s needed are
way out of line because due to their lack of continued manufacture,
they have been designed out of almost everything. so we probably
have enough of them for the rest of the build. cadrpt;build2 needs
will be updated.

we received the following today (well, yesterday):
	100 74S138s
	75  74S157s
	100 74LS164s
	50  9401s
	200 74LS193s (same as 25LS193s, more or less)

these are ample for the remainder of the current build.

come, gather and gaze in awe; the stockroom has been cleaned up.
sing and cheer, the dip boxes have been set in order, and things

in other news, we got in some (but not nearly enough) 82S21s and
9S42s, also adequate numbers of 26S10s (and some other random stuff
of which we already had lots). CADRPT;BUILD2 NEEDS will be updated.

when stuffing them into boards/processors, please do not toss ones
whose legs you bend onto the floor. rebend the legs and use them.
they do cost us money, and should not be wasted.
similarly, it would be apreciated by the local clean-up crew (otherwise
known as ME mostly), if waste would be tossed in the wastebasket, not
on the floor; waste being plastic stripped from wirewrapping wire, broken
dips, polyurethane packing pieces, backing and cut-off pieces from 
labels, peanut shells, etc.

In case anyone is interested, CADR 7 evidently has not died in 24 hours of use
(at least, I used it all yesterday, and Levitt used it most of last night),
which I guess implies that the problem has been fixed...

    Have all the LISPM's with new keyboards attached had their IOB's converted to
    slow down the keyboard clock?  There is no record of it in the board status book.
They wouldn't work if they hadn't been.  Evidently someone was careless.

    Also, the keyboard on CADR8 is marginal, as it screws up on both CADR 7 & 8, while
    the other new keyboard in 936 seems ok.  Also, this problem where chars don't seem
    to get sent immediately is probably a keyboard problem (like up strokes getting lost)
    since the behavior is very different with different keyboards on the same machine.
That problem only happens with the old window system, as far as I can tell.
So I doubt it's the keyboard.

Chaos transceiver #13 is marginal (currently it is residing in 936, it was
previously used on CADR-4).  Transceiver #11 and/or its connector are
also marginal (on the wall near AI).  The connectors supporting the
transceivers in 936 are also marginal, but since I cant find any tools
(piers) to fix it with, I guess it is going to stay that way.

Subject: CADR-7 parity errors
To: CADR at MIT-AI
CC: H at MIT-AI

In the memory, the 5 inch wire in the BUSY L run accumulates a barely
significant (maybe up to 1 volt) amount of noise around the time RAS
turns off, if the machine is running, but not if the cpu is stopped and
the memory is just refreshing.  Replacing the wire with a twisted pair
cuts the noise about in half.  If CADR-7 doesn't get any more parity
errors for a week or so, I guess we'll assume this change fixed it and
make it an official ECO and do it to all the memories. 

Jack, is it possible to put twisted pair on multiwire memories?  Am I
correct in recalling that the layout is better on the MW memories, so
that this problem may not happen with them in the first place?

TTLDM-100: 105
26wire gray ribbon cable: 6 spools @ 100ft.
TTLDM-25 & TTLDM-250: enough for the build with some over

the file CADRPT;BUILD2 NEEDS has been updated.

also some 74LS139s arrived; they are not used in the lispmachine
currently so i suppose they are for taft's hairy power supply
or something.

there is a problem with the new black 
ribbon cable connectors: they are very hard to open.
the ones in boxes in 936 (37pin) are stored open so
they are no problem (unless they close en route to
be attached to a cable), but the 25pin ones seem to 
all be closed, and i haven't figured out how to open them.

another correction to the inventory (or addition, or something):
the blue screw-in ribbon cable connectors, 37 and 25 pin, male and female,
have been superseded by black AMP connectors of the same sizes. there are
about 100 each of the 37pin male and female, in 936. the 25pin ones are
in the stockroom, there are currently about 10 each, but tom callahan shows
a likelihood for conjuring up more when those are used.

In the prom drawer in 936 there is an 8748 labeled "New KBD 8748 Program"
which can be used as a master to fry other 8748's (so we no longer need to
bother people on CADR-6!) -- it should not be used in a kbd unless it is
replaced.

correction to the inventory:
there are 4385 2141s and 1325 4116s in the LISPM stockroom.
most of these are usually inaccessible in the locked cabinets,
where TC hid them to prevent lossage.
the file CADRPT;BUILD2 NEEDS should be changed to indicate
that no more 2141s or 4116s are needed for the current build.

With vague permission, ive used up a few of your chips. (a couple of 74S241, 25S18, and
random low 74 nums). I'd like to have my funnymoney replace them, but quantity prices
says it would be best to buy a bunch of one type. Of the ones i used, the 74S241's were
lowest in stock, but  I'd like to know what you'd like to have a new drawerfulof best.
