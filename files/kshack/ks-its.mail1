RP06 Disk drives are selling for less than the $500 that you state it
will take to fix the existing drive. Has someone contacted used hardware
places in the Boston area (to save shipping charges) to see if they will
either sell or donate an RP06 or two ? I will note that a place in Atlanta
just had several Hundred RP06 drives sent to a scrapper for cents per pound
because there is no market for them any longer.

Well, head 7 on MD's RP06 is deteriorating fast.  JTW just tried cleaning
the heads, but it doesn't look like that helped the problem.  I'm
considering taking ITS down so as to not risk damage to the filesystem.
This drive is not on service contract, and neither AI nor presumably LCS
has any real interest in paying to get it fixed.  It cost about 500 bucks
to get this fixed when it happened to one of AI's drives.

Subject:     Re: 2020 spare parts

The RM0X "DEC-adaptor" talks SMD in one end, and Masbus in the
other. On a 2020 the RH11-c talks 18 bits to the disk, so a
emulex board is no good, becouse you only get 16 bits of data.

If you replaces the rm0x drive with an eagle drive (keeping the
masbus-smd controler) you have to make the controler count 63
sectors/revolution. That is not easy, and the data rate is
23MHz instead of 10Mhz, so some might run and others not.

Whats needed is a controler talking XMD/Eagle bus in one end
and emulates the RH11-c in 18 bit mode. I don't knew of any pirate
device that can do that.

Subject: Re: 2020 spare parts

In most cases swapping RP06s for RP04s is easy to do, and then you can 
throw the RP04s away (if you think RP06s are worthless, you should see
whats little RP04s are worth). They will give you a lot more disk space
for the same footprint, heat, etc. All of these are Massbus devices, so
there should be no trouble. 

I will talk to the guy who owns the company that I deal with on these 
things, and see what they might think about 'donating' somce RP06s
to MIT. Transportation is the only real problem. Shipping them costs 
around 250-300 dollars each I think (thats what it costs for big heavy
tape drives from Atlanta to Washington.) but it could be more. You can 
do what I am doing with my 2020, which is declare a 'road-trip' and 
fly down to Atlanta, rent a truck and drive them back to save some 
bucks. 

If you just wanted to have them 'donate' the hardware and then scrap them
out for parts in Atlanta, and ship up the resulting spares kits, that would
cost relativly little. 

Concerning disks on 2020's I have been wondering for a while if there 
would not be a way to use more compact disks on the systems without a 
lot of hacking to do it. We just picked up a bunch of Fuji 2284 and Eagle
drives at work for some vaxen and the remaining PDP-11s that are around.
The 2284 has 160megs (emulates 2 RM03 drives) and uses the SMD interface.
Does the RH11 Massbus controller that DEC uses have a special 18/36 bit
mode that it uses on the 2020, or would there be a way to use an 
Emulex SC21-B1 SMD controller and a Fuji drive on a 2020, rather than
the big, bulks, balky RH11/RM03 combination ? Since the 2284 takes up
10.5 inches of rack space vs. 2 RM03s, it would be a very big win.
In this same like of thought, there are some unibus SCSI adapters around.
Why not put some 5.25 inch hard disks on it, and mount them in the 
bottom of the 2020 itself. Then it would really be Kloset Sized - 10!

If I had a spare RP06 or two I'd put it on the 9th floor in place of
some MX drives that have been declared dead. I might connect it to
MX instead of the RP04's, too, but then again I might not know what
I'm talking about.

In the absence of serious inspiration on someone's part, we are stuck
with the damn RP06's. It is also clear that with the exception of AI
noone really wants to pay to fix em. I think that if almost-free spares
are available we should at least get a couple and strip them for boards
and heads and such. There are a lot of things that we can fix trivially
if we have the parts (MC last month, for instance.)

We want RP06, cards, ie the memorex board, the interface board,

A 60Hz rp06 is to expensive to ship to us, bu we have got our
hands on a cupple of rp06 drives, that was part of a IBM-comaptible
Memorex disk subsystem. And with scrapped rp04 DCL boxes and
power supply, and the DEC specific board for the rp06 we will
make working DEC-talking Rp06.

(.Anyone realized that an rp06 is running in maint mode, with
  dcl attached where the maintenence borads usally fit.)

The old KI is running KI*3 Bottoms 10, symetrical.

two processors will fail without more cables. Need is approx

    I keep hearing that the RP06's on the MIT KS machines have problems.
    This company is swimming in RP06's, and routinely sends them off to the
    scrappers at cents to the pound. Might it e a good idea to have spare
    drives arounf tech square, or are the ITS machines of such priority
    that this would not be worth it?

Considerations:

1.  Where can we put them?  The AI Lab isn't exactly swimming in dead
storage space these days.

2.  If OZ is flushed, that would free up more RP06's than we could possibly
keep as spares, so this would be wasted effort.

3.  MD has always been thought of as an organ doner, so perhaps we already
has a spare RP06.

4.  Who, exactly is going to invest the time and expense (perhaps minimal)
in arranging to ship these here?  I, for example, don't plan to do anything
about this myself.

5.  Any effort spent on this might be better spent on a number of other
related projects.  I'm sure JTW would be happy to explain to anyone just
what other options we have thought about for improving the RP06 situation.

6.  If we had a spare RP06 in the basement, would it really be more
convenient to drag it up to the 9th floor and install it than to wait a
couple of days for DEC to fix the broken one?

Points 1 and 6 do not apply to LCS, who might feel separate responsibility
for the maintenence of the MC KS10.

Yes, there will be an IAP course this January about ITS.  The first meeting
will take place in the 7th floor playroom this Tuesday (the 6th) at 7:30 PM.

On Tuesday we will talk about a number of things, including what topics
people might want to hear about in future sessions.  As a main event, I am
preparing an explanation of everyone's favorite ITS feature:

               PCLSRing:  What it is, how it's implemented,
                   and why Lisp Machines should have it.

I'll try and satisfy both the people who want to hear about low-level,
bits-between-the-toes issues, and those who want to learn universal, cosmic
principles.  I'll even relate PCLSRing to quantum mechanics.

I suggest that all private owners of 2020's get on to DECmailer service.
It's free (until you use it) and it is about the best "last resort" for
spares.  The more of us who are in their database, the less likely they'll
drop supporting spares for us (they are still supporting PDP-4 spares!).

The DECmailer price for a swap bad-for-good for the 2020 power supply is
$880.  When my 2020's power supply bit it last August, I bought Eli's
2020's power supply for $600 plus $80 to Fed Ex it here.  I later found
out that LH Research (the maker of the power supply) will fix my busted
one for $400.  Sometime I'm going to send them my busted supply so I will
have a spare.

Beware.  2020 power supplies are *hairy*.  It isn't like the cretinous
DEC power supplies that are trivial to fix.  With a DEC power supply, you
just find the fried picofuse, replace it with a *real* fuse, and change
the fan (which failed, which caused the supply to overheat, which caused
the silly fuse to blow).  A $16 repair.  It isn't that simple with a 2020
power supply.  They're a bear to take apart and once you do you find an
inpenetrable maze of wires and VAC all over the place.  Without schematics
there is no hope of fixing one unless there is something obviously burnt.

Eli's 2020's power supply was not the latest rev.  That suggests that Eli's
2020 may not be the latest rev either.  I don't know how good it would be
as a source of spare boards.

If MRC has it's power supply, then the KS-10 would be a very nice

In-Reply-To: "Leigh L. Klotz"'s message of Tue, 30 Dec 86 20:42:38 EST

I stopped by Eli's a couple of weeks ago for some chips, but asked the
same thing.

Me:  Do you happen to have a KS-10 system around?
Him:  A what?
Me:  A 2020.
Him:  Oh, no.  They're old.
Me:  That's why I thought you might have one.

I stopped by Eli's today and asked if they still had their
2020 for sale.  They didn't understand.  Then I asked for
a KS-10 and they didn't understand that either.  They said
a guy came by and wanted to buy a PDP-1, and they couldn't
help him either.  They gave me a vinyl plastic numeral 1
with a calendar on it.

Well, the stories in the Globe must be true.  You know Symbolics is in
trouble when it sells the bedrock of its computational resources...

Your chance to bring ITS up on an even more obsolete machine than the
KS!  (It's probably a lot faster, if this is any consolation...)

OOps.  I guess he found my office anyway since the tape disappeared the

    A friend of us Jan-Erik Gustafsson is in the Boston area. I asked him
    to visit you and bring an incremental dump of ai from may. So we got
    the latest (and greatest version)....

I have generated a tape containing all files written (on the relevant set
of directories) between the day I made your distribution tape and today.
It is sitting on top of the file cabinet in my office at MIT labeled "ITS
Update for SI".  I'm CC'ing this message to KS-ITS so that if your friend
comes looking for it, it will be more likely that someone around here will
be able to help him.

When you get this tape, I'm not sure what the best way to load it will be.
If you tell DUMP

  LOAD MERGE NOASK

then no file in your filesystem will be overwritten.  But you probably -do-
want to overwrite most (but not all!) of the files with the newer ones from
the tape.  So if you tell DUMP just

  LOAD MERGE

then DUMP will ask you a question for each possible overwrite, and you can
decide on a case-by-case basis what you want to do.  It will -almost- be
the right thing to always overwrite with the file from the tape, but not
always...

One file you want to be a little careful about is SYSBIN;DUMP BIN.  You
-don't- want the version of SYSBIN;DUMP BIN from the tape since that has
been assembled for AI.  Of course you always can create a new DUMP BIN for
your system by assembling SYSENG;DUMP > and telling it that you want to make
a DUMP for SI.

Another file you must -not- overwrite is SYSENG;MACRO TAPES.  This is the
file that contains your local tape database.  The tape I'm sending has a
copy of AI's tape database, which you certainly don't want.

I have appended a listing of the tape to the end of this message so that
you can see in advance what it contains.

When you get the tape, you will want to install a new microcode and
assemble a new ITS.  The new microcode has some bug fixes and supports
single stepping (mostly, there are still some bugs).  You will want to use
the :KSFEDR program to replace the RAM file in your front-end filesystem
with KSHACK;RAM 261.

(If you screw up the microcode file in the front-end filesystem, you can
always use the DSKDMP KS10 boot tape that came with your original
distribution kit to get ITS started and fix the damage.  Recall that a KS10
boot tape has a microcode image on it.)

The old ITS will run with the new microcode (right Dave?), so get the
microcode running first, before booting an ITS assembled from the latest
sources.

The new binary for timesharing DDT (SYS;ATSIGN DDT) also contains
modifications for single stepping (I think), but unless you actually try
and use the single-stepping command (^N) it should work fine with any
combination of microcode and ITS.

Hi Rob -

     No, I haven't developed a patch to make COMSAT run without a network
but I didn't even try.  I'm not all that sure I know how to start COMSAT;
there are some *dim* memories from 10 years ago...  I have sent the sum
of my experiences to KS-ITS.  I hope they are useful and not just random
flamage.

     I still claim that it isn't all that unreasonable to require that a
net be turned on.  Am I correct in believing that some of the ITSes are
Chaos-only systems and that all the system software (Telnet, COMSAT in
particular) runs fine on them?  If so, then maybe turning on Chaos should
just be a requirement.  After all, that does give you interprocess
communication (via local Chaos links).

     By the way, you guys might want to look at Cafard, the protocol I
use for TTY-based mail on TOPS-20.  You should be able to use the CAFPRO
module without modification.  Then at the very least you would have TTY
mailing.  Which reminds me; if ITS does not have any form of DTR control
from user programs it should have it.  Also, my dialups don't seem to
work under ITS; it apparently never raises DTR in response to RI.

Too bad about the EST/EDT hard code in ITS. I guess it is fortunate that
I live on the east coast....

Is there a rundown somewhere on what the network capabilities of ITS
are ? Once I have the 2020 in the basement along with the rest of the zoo,
it might be nice to get a local net established. A short description of
what it knows how to do now, anyone ?

Thanks,
Doug

Gack.  Sorry about the state of COMSAT and about that nonsense with
system source code living on SRA;.  I promised the guys in Sweden that
I'd give them a patch to run COMSAT without a network some time ago, but
I never finished it.  Have you actually managed to patch things together
so that COMSAT runs without a network or are you lost too (I couldn't
tell from your message)?  If you have it kludged into a working state,
please send your patch to KS-ITS so that the people on further shores
will know how to do it.

Oh, BTW, things are worse than you think.  Almost all network code still
assumes that you are in timezone -0500 (EST or EDT).  Another item on
the wish list....

[If you got two copies of this message it's because ZMAIL spazzed....]

	 I guess what confused me was that the bughalt message included
    a POPJ P, in its output.  I didn't think carefully as to what $Q-2
    meant.  I assume that is nominally expected to be the instruction
    before the bughalt, presumably a skip-class instruction that states
    the bug condition?

That was the idea.  It didn't work in this case because the code was
	skip false
	 popj p,
	bughlt
instead of
	skip true
         bughlt
	  popj p,
The poor user interface is a result of implementing the user interface by
just valreting commands to EDDT.  I looked the other night at fixing the
bughlt mechanism so you can't $P after a fatal one, but it looked a little
too difficult for me since all the bughlt cases quickly join into common
code, and the $P goes directly back to the program, not into the bughlt
routine (i.e. it calls EDDT with tail recursion removal).

     Ah, silly me.  The ITS bughalt mechanism looks so much like
WAITS' (obviously Moon was influenced during his stint on the west
coast) that I allowed myself to believe it followed WAITS' semantics
that the correct response after fixing the problem was always to
type $P.  Instead, an ITS bughalt is like a TOPS-20 bughlt, non-
continuable unless you send the system to a specific place.  $P in
this case on TOPS-20 will cause a crash dump and reload.

     I guess what confused me was that the bughalt message included
a POPJ P, in its output.  I didn't think carefully as to what $Q-2
meant.  I assume that is nominally expected to be the instruction
before the bughalt, presumably a skip-class instruction that states
the bug condition?

     There is a possibility that I have fixed the crowbar problem
once and for all; in any case it hasn't hit in a few days.  The
problem seemed to be that the power supply was delivering much higher
than +5V.  I cranked the voltage adjustement several turns(!) before
I finally got the two +5 voltages to a reasonable approximation of
+5V.  It's possible that the power supply is really sick, since I had
adjusted it down to +5 just a few days before and only succeeded in
scaring the crowbar problem away for a day or so.

     I discovered from talking to DEC field service types that drive
control logic crowbar is a well-known way for RM03's to bite it (the
other being a slightly higher-than average fondness for head crashing).
Most DECies won't adjust the power supply; they simply replace it.
This is a reason why RM03's cost more to maintain than they are worth,
and why DEC is actively trying to kill Massbus peripherals as products.
My conclusion about RM03's is that you should consider them as being
disposable storage media.  At $400 in the used market they're cheaper
than most floppy disks, so use 'em until they break and don't spend too
much time trying to fix 'em.

     Is there a database being kept on the ways in which KS-based systems
lose?  If not, perhaps with all the hacker KS systems appearing in the
world one should be set up.  AI seems like a good central place to
maintain it.  I'll contribute a few more notes:

     Problem: TU45 cannot be seen from the KS.  TOPS-20 (I don't know
what ITS does) thinks there are no tape drives, an MT console command
just gives a ?BT error.  Turning the id thumbwheel to 7 causes the 1600
BPI light to come on, otherwise it stays off (abnormal).
     Diagnosis: TM03 controller is not talking to the KS or to the
drive.  Check TM03 LED's; probably it isn't powered on.
     Solution: Remove TM03 power supply, mounted on the lower left side
of the rack when facing the drive from the front).  Open it up and
check all the picofuses.  Replace the blown picofuse, perhaps with a
*real* fuse.  While you're at it, check the power supply fan; often the
reason the fuse bought it is that the fan is sick and the supply got too
hot.

     Problem: System failure.  When you walk into the machine room the
KS power light is "sizzling" and the console is going crazy, or the KS
power light is off and everything is dead.
     Diagnosis: Main KS power supply is dead (in my case the +12 output
died...memory doesn't work too well without +12).
     Solution: Replace/repair the supply.  Field repair is quite
difficult in this supply; 120VAC runs all through it and it is a major
effort to get the boards out.  You can try looking for a blown picofuse
but it's unlikely the fix will be this simple.  If you have DEC field
service come and fix your system on time and materials the cost is a
few grand, easily.  DECmailer service (*all* KS owners should be on
DECmailer; it's free and is worth having as a last resort) will cost
$880 to swap your bad supply for a good one.  However, unlike most DEC
equipment the KS uses a power supply from a real vendor instead of a
DEC power supply.  The vendor, LH Research, will not sell you a new
KS power supply but they will fix it for a flat fee of $400.
     I bought a replacement power supply from Eli Heffron's (the last
one, alas) for $600.  Someday I will get my bad one fixed so I have a
spare.

     Oh well, I hope I haven't bored everybody with all of this.  I
wouldn't waste much effort trying to make ITS handle RM03 crowbar
gracefully.  TOPS-20's "graceful recovery" requires a wizard to quickly
force the system into EDDT and fix the problem before the software
timeouts hit and the system bughlts irrecoverably.  I'm sure someone
who knows the ITS disk code better than I do can perform similar feats.
But making the hardware reliable is a much better idea.

    I don't know why, but your mailer insists upon replying to MRC@PANDA.MIT.EDU
    instead of MRC%PANDA@SUMEX-AIM.Stanford.EDU.  Is Babyl being too "smart"?

This could be COMSAT's fault, as others have noted, or it could be a
problem I have with a personal TECO macro.  I suspect COMSAT myself.  It's
very unlikely that Babyl is at fault.

    The error which occured when the drive control logic (not the drive, which
    was perfectly happy the whole time) crowbarred was "DSK: MASSBUS ERROR,
    CS1= 140300".  It then did a bughalt (this is something new to me; didn't
    ITS used to just do a JRST 4,.?

Yeah.  There are still a few JRST 4,.'s, but a few years ago Moon replaced
most of them with a BUG macrology.  There is a large comment in the front
of SYSTEM;ITS that explains how it works.

				     Its present behavior is a definite
    improvement!).  The BUGPC was CAI DSKBRK, $Q-2 was a POPJ P,.  I didn't
    poke at ITS at all on this, since it was painfully obvious what happened.
    So, I reset the power supply, and when the hardware was all happy again,
    I just did an $P to DDT.  I got an ITS REVIVED message....

Well the bughalt in question was a BUG HALT rather than a BUG PAUSE, so in
fact ITS didn't expect you to type $P.  I looked at the source, and
proceeding this particular bughalt drops into a random place in the disk
code.  I'm suprised the system ran long enough to type anything at all.
The error message in a BUG PAUSE would have advised you that an $P was a
possibility.  The message in a BUG HALT gives you no such permission,
although sometimes, after understanding the problem more throughly, you can
sometimes decide to $P anyway.  (This may strike you as weird, but remember
that the message isn't designed to be read by hackers like you and I, but
by some random graduate student who just came in and found ITS was down.)

I certainly agree that it would be a nice idea (especially for you) to put
a little code after that bughalt that resets the disk system and starts
things up again.

Friends -

     Here are the main observations I have as a result of installing
ITS on PandaMonium:

1) The RM03 version of ITS needs to have the current cylinder code
   removed.
2) It would be preferable if the code used the information from the
   Massbus to determine what sort of disk drive is used instead of
   assembling it in ITS.  TOPS-20 does this.  I believe that you can't
   mix RM03's, RP04's, and RP06's on a single system in the curren ITS.
3) ITS EDDT is rather, uh, difficult to use.  I wasn't able to single-
   step in it, for example.  I guess this isn't terribly important.
4) Procedures need to be established to automatically create directories
   when loading a system from dump tape, and also to suppress the SYSxxx;
   directory warning.  One way to do this is to have people load the
   filesystem using the Salvager instead of DUMP.
5) I don't know if it makes sense to build systems without a network,
   considering how much software (including the mailer) fails to work
   on non-network systems.  It would probably be alright if Chaos was
   always turned on, if that's the critical point (if I'm correct, MD
   and ML are Chaos but not Internet, right?).  I think the lost space
   is more than made up by having a working mailer.
6) Software that knows about the names of all the systems presents a
   problem.  I don't have a pat answer for this.
7) Running NAME or WHOIS with an argument doesn't work.  F^K works, but
   :F MRC just outputs a blank line.  I suspect it's confused by PM not
   being a known MIT name.
8) All of the software WILL fit on a single RM03 if you delete all the
   extraneous versions of lots of stuff.  You will have to rebuild EMACS
   and a few other things if you do this though.
9) Entirely too much system software and sources live on private user
   directories and are lunk to in the SYSxxx; directories.  For example,
   a resolver source file is on SRA; with a link on SYSNET;.  Scratch one
   source file that would have been useful.  It would be nice if this was
   cleaned up.

     In summary, though, I think you guys have done an excellent job.
Congratulations.

Rob -

     Touche.  In fact, there are two bugs:
1) MMailr builds an SMTP return path of the form @SUMEX-AIM.ARPA:MRC@PANDA,
   even though DoD policy expressly forbids names that are not in the
   Internet domain from appearing in an address.
2) MMailr trusts the DoD policy, and so ignores the @SUMEX-AIM.ARPA: part
   and parses MRC@PANDA.  Unfortunately, MRC@PANDA means something else in
   the MIT domain (and, for that matter, in the Stanford domain with the
   exception of SUMEX-AIM!).

     Someday I plan on fixing these bugs.  Note that either bug by itself
is no big deal (Unix sendmail has bug #1), it's the combination that is
nasty.

     Why is COMSAT or whatever using the return path?

Maybe.  And maybe MMAILR is being too "stupid".  When I get mail from
you directly on XX (with the latest and greatest MMAILR, via TCP/SMTP)
it still claims that I have mail from "MRC@PANDA.MIT.EDU.#Chaos".

More likely it is the old COMSAT "feature" which has been screwing

That code should be dyked out if anybody has the ambition to figure
out where it is.

instead of MRC%PANDA@SUMEX-AIM.Stanford.EDU.  Is Babyl being too "smart"?

The error which occured when the drive control logic (not the drive, which
was perfectly happy the whole time) crowbarred was "DSK: MASSBUS ERROR,
CS1= 140300".  It then did a bughalt (this is something new to me; didn't
ITS used to just do a JRST 4,.?  Its present behavior is a definite
improvement!).  The BUGPC was CAI DSKBRK, $Q-2 was a POPJ P,.  I didn't
poke at ITS at all on this, since it was painfully obvious what happened.
So, I reset the power supply, and when the hardware was all happy again,
I just did an $P to DDT.  I got an ITS REVIVED message.

Then, I got a message of the form
DSK: ERR UNIT #0 ER1=40200 ER2=17777 ER3=4000 STARTING DISK ADDR= 31,,30
It repeated many times with different disk addresses.  I also got a few
messages of the form:
DSK: IRREC DATA ERR #2 UNIT=0 BLK= 16321
DSK: ERR UNIT #0 ER1=402
I regularly got "DSK: TOO MANY ERRORS" and the system bugpaused with a
BUGPC of UNSAFE+2 and $Q-2 of SKIPE USFHLT.  Finally, I gave up and
reloaded.

As far as I could tell from the salvager, absolutely no disk I/O actually
happened from the instant the power supply first crowbarred, in spite of
the fact that it claimed that it had written a few files to system
directories.

I know that TOPS-20 can get out of this.  As I remember from studying
PHYP4.MAC when I was porting TOPS-20 to the SC-30M, TOPS-20 is quite
willing to do a complete hard reset and recalibrate of the drive at the
slightest sign of trouble beyond a piddling ECC error.

    EDDT, fix the drive, and proceed TOPS-20 without problems.  So I

Well, there is code that tries to deal with things like this.  I have
tested it by shutting drives off while timesharing was running and after
they spun back up, ITS continued merrily on its way.  So sometimes it
works.  That doesn't mean it will work in all circumstances, of course...

Where did ITS actually BUG HALT, and what did it say?  What were the disk
errors it reported after you proceeded it?

The init file you want is EMACS; EMACS TECO.  Doing

:TECO $ER EMACS; EMACS TECO$ @Y M(HFX*) W MMRUN$PURIFY$DUMP$TS NEMACS$$

should work.  You might want to use some other version of TECO (NTECO,
whatever), look around first.

Once you have an editor you can look for the SYSxxx; thingie yourself,
your guess is as good as mine where to look for it.

Thanks for all your help.  I loaded all the tapes onto a single RM03
by judicious deleting of excessive versions of various files.  There
was a lot of completely unnecessary junk!  However, I broke EMACS, of
course, because it used an old TECPUR.  I was able to use dump environment
to get an interim TS EMACS, but what is the correct way to make a
TS EMACS on ITS?

By the way, ITS' disk error recovery code may need some help.  I have a
disk drive whose power supply periodically crowbars.  It happened to me
while running ITS.  Normally, I can force TOPS-20 into EDDT, fix the
drive, and proceed TOPS-20 without problems.  So I thought when it
happened to ITS I could do the same thing since ITS stopped in EDDT.  It
was not to be; it just continually reported disk errors.  I think you
should be able to reproduce this problem by powering off the DCL on a
drive while ITS is running, let it bughlt, then power it back up and try
to proceed ITS.

I think the difference is that TOPS-20 decides under certain circumstances
that the drive needs to be completely reset before trying again and ITS
doesn't have this code.  It shouldn't be hard to do.

Of course, there is something to say for having more reliable hardware!

Is there any way to sabotage the system logging writes onto SYSxxx;
directories when loading a filesystem from tape?  I wasted quite a bit
of console paper...

    I took a long shot and patched the instructions at QINTAT+23 from
    IORDQ A,mumble to MOVE A,QPOSGL(Q).  The system works like a champ
    with that patch!  If I'm not mistaken (remember, I'm hacking blindly
    from EDDT), what I've pretty much done is sabotage seek error
    detection, right?

Well, that's what I would have thought...  However, a close look at some
documentation I thought I had read before reveals that the RM03, unlike the
RP0n's, doesn't have a Current Cylinder register at all.  Instead there is
some kind of maintenance register at that address.  I guess that little
consistency check should just be removed for RM03 systems.  The drive is
supposed to signal an error if it has a problem seeking anyway.

    The second bring up of the system after running the Salvager to note
    the address of the front end filesystem deletes the .TEMP. and CRASH
    directories.  Is this expected?  I created a silly -DONT- DELETE link
    to make those directories non-empty.

Not necessary.  There is a little table of directories that ITS will make
automatically whenever anyone references them.  This table includes .TEMP.
and CRASH.

    I started loading the filesystem, but DUMP fails in a OPEN right
    away complaining that .INFO. doesn't exist.  If there is an option to
    DUMP to instruct it to create directories, I couldn't find it.

Oops.  We goofed.  We intended to fix that before sending out the next
distribution kit, but forgot all about it.  There certainly should be an
option to DUMP to make it do that, and I can't imagine how we got this far
without it...  For the moment, you can just create the directories yourself
by hand whenever DUMP complains and then just proceed it.

    I hope that my information about the QINTAT+23 patch gives you guys
    enough information to develop a more suitable patch.

Your current patch is just about as good as any we could have given you.

Super!

     Okay, here's what I've done so far.  Whenever testing ITS, I yanked
the id plugs out of the other drives so ITS can't possibly see them.  I
tried the various breakpoints that you've suggested, and here's what I
observed.  The system is getting periodic attention interrupts, perhaps
at the 1/2 second rate you referred to.  It gets to QINTAT+25 where it
compares A with QPOSGL.  At this point A holds 10700 and QPOSGL holds 631.
My impression from DDT is that the drive got a seek done attention
interrupt, it wants cylinder 631, and it got 10700 as the position
instead.  It reacted by doing a recalibrate, and got another one of these
attention interrupts and...

     The system CAN be shutdown by the SH console command.

     It takes a couple of seconds after the CRLF from the Salvager
finishing before it gets into this state.

     I could not hear any obvious seeking noises from the drive when
the system was in this state.

	 I tried it again.  Each time QCST contained 104204.  NQSATN, NQEATN,
    and NQOFFL all contained 0.  I suspected as much, since the disks I am
    using have no errors, ECC or otherwise.

	 I rather doubt that it is disks interrupting endlessly.  From what I
    was able to trace, it looked like the code was looping at interrupt level
    and never dismissing.

More things to look at:

QSDU/ unit actually transferring or -1 if controller idle
QSEEK/ per-unit, -1 if seeking
QRCAL/ per-unit, -1 if recalibrating

That's the first line of figuring out what the software thinks it's doing.
Also put a breakpoint at QINT3X before starting the system and see how many
times it gets there.  QINTE is a good place to put a breakpoint, too
(most disk errors go there).
Put a breakpoint at RHCHEK if you want to see every command it sends to
the disk.
Breakpoint at QINTAT+2 to intercept attention handling (Q is drive number).

My guess is it initiated the first seek and then lost when the attention
came back, since %HXSC and %HMSEK are in QCST.  I don't have very high
confidence in this guess, though.  It's quite a mystery.

    Presently I halted it and poked around.  I found that the system was
    looping in the code at QINT2C.  It would eventually get to the
    SKIPGE D,QSRAC(C) at QINT2L+2; QSRAC+36 contained 0 so it jumped back
    to QINT2C, go to the SETO C, at QINT2D+1, and began the cycle again.

This doesn't make complete sense, because if the SKIPGE D,QSRAC(C)
skipped (having a 0 operand), it would have skipped -over- the JRST
QINT2C.  More likely the instruction before it, SKIPL QUSR(C), skipped
(i.e. this disk channel was not in use).  My question would be, did it
get to QINT3X or was it looping inside the disk scheduler proper?  I
would expect it to find nothing to do on the disk and come out to
QINT3X.  I guess that's the root of Alan's continuous interrupt theory
too.  Note the comment there that the RH11 doesn't seem to need to reset
pending interrupt requests.  If it is getting to QINT3X, but just
interrupting again, the best way to proceed would be to see what the
hardware thinks it's doing.  Note: the software causes a disk interrupt
every 1/2 second, for the benefit of broken disk controllers, so it
might look to you like it's interrupting continuously when its problem
is really something else.  The SH (is that right?) command to the
front-end to get to DDT should work if it's not in continuous disk
interrupts; it's implemented by PI7, the lowest priority interrupt
level.

Don't blame me, I didn't write this disk code.  It's actually very
straightforward, but that fact is obscured because almost all of the
labels are remarkably poorly chosen.  I'm told it started life as
microtape code and gradually evolved.

Another guess I have is that you have extra RM03s that you didn't tell
ITS about.  I don't think we've tried having extra disk drives attached
to an RH11 before.  Were they on-line?  Powered-up?  Of course extra
drives shouldn't screw things up, but there might be a bug.

	 I initially thought it was looping in the salvager, but after
    running the standalone salvager and poking around a bit I realized it
    was looping in ITS.  I tried starting ITS at GO without running the
    salvager; this time it got stuck in the code including QDW3/QPOSR+11,
    etc.

My guess is that this is simply another point in the same loop, not a
different symptom.

    please consider replacing the cretinous ITS
    EDDT with DEC EDDT or KDDT.  I imagine you have already considered this,
    since there really is no good reason for yet another DDT.

Thanks for the suggestion, but I don't think we're interested.
"Cretinous" and "yet another" are relative terms.  From our point of
view the DEC EDDTs are "yet another".

	 Turning to more important matters, if you want to debug this you
    are quite welcome to.  

I don't think MIT has a lot of resources for software support, and I really
shouldn't be spending a great deal of time on this either.  ITS comes to
you on an as-is basis, as they say.

    I'm sure this would be
    a helluva lot faster than trying to second-guess the problem remotely
    and sending another set of tapes only to find that they fail too...

Sure, but I imagine if the bug is diagnosed at this end, we would send
you a patch to type in rather than fussing around with tapes.  If you're
familiar with the RH11 hardware it would probably be quickest for you
to diagnose it yourself, unless the problem is really something intricate
in the software rather than a straightforward hardware-related problem.
That would be the thing to look for first, in my experience.

    ...  I regret to inform you that the installation was unsuccessful.

Well I understand that you are disappointed, but I'm actually impressed
that it worked as smoothly as it did.  Specifically, I'm happy to hear that
the salvager apparently works.

         I got as far as building @ ITS and running it.  It typed
    "Salvager 226" and pawed over the disks for a while.  It then typed
    a CRLF and went silent.  I waited several minutes and nothing happened.
    Presently I halted it and poked around.  I found that the system was
    looping in the code at QINT2C.  It would eventually get to the
    SKIPGE D,QSRAC(C) at QINT2L+2; QSRAC+36 contained 0 so it jumped back
    to QINT2C, go to the SETO C, at QINT2D+1, and began the cycle again.

         I initially thought it was looping in the salvager, but after
    running the standalone salvager and poking around a bit I realized it
    was looping in ITS.  I tried starting ITS at GO without running the
    salvager; this time it got stuck in the code including QDW3/QPOSR+11,
    etc.

Well, it looks like the RM03 is continuously interrupting, since all of
this is interrupt level disk code.  It would be interesting to know what
was in:

QCST	; Contents of CS1 register of disk controller when it last
	; interrupted.
NQSATN	; Count of spurious attention interrupts
NQEATN	; Count of attention interrupts reporting errors in mid-transfer
NQOFFL	; Count of times drive dropped offline

There are a bunch of other disk variables you might check, but I'm
initially betting this has something to do with some of the disk error
randomness we have observed here, and something the RM03 does makes the bug
worse.

It would be nice if there was a way to take a crash dump so that we could
look at it...

         I have two immediate suggestions.  First is that ITS should note
    various "landmarks" in what it is doing, such as outputting ITS.nnnn
    when it takes over from the salvager....

Actually, that's what the CRLF the salvager types is for.  We don't seem to
be great fans of verbosity here in ITS land.

    Second, please consider replacing the cretinous ITS EDDT with DEC EDDT
    or KDDT.  I imagine you have already considered this, since there
    really is no good reason for yet another DDT....

I don't think we ever considered this seriously.  It took about 100
keystrokes to successfully convert Exec DDT to the KS10, and once it was
working we never though about it again.

Friends -

     I received my ITS distribution set on Tuesday, and attempted to
install it early this morning after some DECnet(ugh!) hacking.  I
regret to inform you that the installation was unsuccessful.

     I got as far as building @ ITS and running it.  It typed
"Salvager 226" and pawed over the disks for a while.  It then typed
a CRLF and went silent.  I waited several minutes and nothing happened.

SKIPGE D,QSRAC(C) at QINT2L+2; QSRAC+36 contained 0 so it jumped back

running the standalone salvager and poking around a bit I realized it
was looping in ITS.  I tried starting ITS at GO without running the
salvager; this time it got stuck in the code including QDW3/QPOSR+11,
etc.

     I have two immediate suggestions.  First is that ITS should note
various "landmarks" in what it is doing, such as outputting ITS.nnnn
when it takes over from the salvager.  The salvager should do something
like type a dot every n whatevers so the user knows that it is doing
something useful.  Second, please consider replacing the cretinous ITS
EDDT with DEC EDDT or KDDT.  I imagine you have already considered this,
since there really is no good reason for yet another DDT.  Is DEC EDDT
too big?  Poking at the hangs would have been a lot easier had some
very basic things such as single-stepping worked (I tried both $X and
CTRL/N).

     Turning to more important matters, if you want to debug this you
are quite welcome to.  I have an active KLINIK on my 2020; just give
me a call before I leave at around noonish (3PM your time) and I'll
be happy to give you KLINIK access and standalone time on my system
for the rest of the afternoon.  I think my wife will be home so she
could assist (e.g. mounting tapes) if you need.  I'm sure this would be
a helluva lot faster than trying to second-guess the problem remotely
and sending another set of tapes only to find that they fail too...

    Hackers,

    It has been suggested that it might be a good idea to teach an ITS course
    during IAP this year.  We have done this twice before with somewhat mixed
    results.  A few sessions were quite memorable, and a few were dogs.  Before
    I decide if I want to front for this again this year, I would like to hear
    from some other people.  Specifically I want to hear:

    Things people want to learn about.

    Opinions about what has worked in the past.

    Volunteers who would enjoy teaching about something.

    Ways of using this to burn excess machine cycles on our many (!) ITS
    machines.  (Student project ideas?)

I don't think I have any of my notes from IAP'83.  Do you (Alan) have
any from IAP'84?  I seemed to remember talking about some of the
following:
	UUOs/.CALL, their skip-on-success feature, their argument
	  passing/returning syntax
	TTY management
	Devices, MLDEV:, CLU/I/O/A:, etc
	Jobs (and BOJs)
	File system, links, etc.
	Greenblat's History lecture
	Moon's hardware description of (the original) AI
With the general proliferation of PCs and high level languages, some of
the more gutsy things, which are the interesting things, may require a
(refresher) course on the assembly language concepts.

Guillermo Rozas makes a good point, but I think time will eventually
invalidate it.  The general trend in the industry is to move away from
lots and lots of funky terminal protocols towards a ANSI.  By far the
biggest market is the VTxxx and compatible market.

The one thing that is vendor-dependent are the timing considerations
(although some vendors are careful to emulate DEC's timings to the
point of adding delay loops since some applications have cared!).
That is why most of us have thrown up our hands in despair of ever
getting padding to work and settled on XON/XOFF, with all of its
problems.

It *would* be nice to flush CRTSTY for all the ANSI terminals, wouldn't
it?  I don't see how that can be done without XON/XOFF.  I wish this
was not the case; I admit it, it took me a *long* while to unlearn CTRL/S
for search.

    Neither of these are really hard, and it would be nice to be able to
    flush CRTSTY, wouldn't it?

I don't think flushing CRTSTY is reasonable.  I think it is perfectly
reasonable for the operating system to support intrinsically only a
small set of terminals (the most common terminals), and to have a
program like CRTSTY which can be used when you don't use a standard
terminal.  Manufacturers are likely to come up with completely random
terminals, and if there were nothing like CRTSTY the support would
have to be added to the operating system every time a new one
appeared.

What the set of intrinsically supported terminals should be is
debatable, and "installation" dependent, and it is perfectly
reasonable to add common terminals of the VTxxx flavor, but CRTSTY is
too convenient to give up.

    Has anyone actually tried the AAA stuff on a VT100?  You need to turn off
    insert/delete for some of them, but if the AAA is a real ANSI terminal it
    should work alright.

Yes, I have.  :TCTYP AAA HEIGHT 24 -%TOLID -%TOCID (to be safe) still
doesn't work quite right.  It loses on cursor addressing (I think).
Telnet in, do this TCTYP, and run SRA;TS ALICE and you'll see what's
wrong in a jiffy (it does get the reverse video mode line right, I'll
give it that).

Once you (reluctantly I admit) resign yourself to XON/XOFF flow control,
you don't have to worry about issues like what happens over a network.
You do the flow control at the local end (e.g. at the TAC).  In fact,
that's how most commercial networks work and you have to go to extremes
to prevent them from intercepting the flow control characters.

I'm not arguing against padding VT100 support; by all means VT100 support
should be added with padding!  What I'm asking for is for XON/XOFF support
as well, as a separate issue.  TCTYP can be taught that VT125 is simply
VT100+XON/XOFF, etc.

Has anyone actually tried the AAA stuff on a VT100?  You need to turn off
insert/delete for some of them, but if the AAA is a real ANSI terminal it

Adding interrupt-level ^S/^Q processing wouldn't be all that hard,
specially for machines like the KS where I-level TTY code runs
entirely on the -10 rather than half in an 11. However this approach
is useless for terminals connected by a network.

I think it might be worth doing padding-based support for the VT100
because almost all of the third-party VT100 clones are faster than
the DEC version, and padding to the DEC numbers makes them all work.
ITS already knows about Ambassadors, which i believe are close to ANSI.

Speaking about VTxxx terminals, I might be interested in doing something
about ITS support for them.  Does ITS support ANY ANSI terminals?

I see two issues that would need to be addressed and discussed.  First
is the entire question of XON/XOFF.  There are simply too many VTxxx
sorts of terminals from different vendors, each with different timings,
to make padding practical.  It might be worth a try for the basic DEC
VT100 (since DEC publishes those timings), but after that forget it.
Among other things, you have terminals in which you can NOT disable
automatic XON/XOFF.  I'm directly aware of the printer port option and
the VT125 (graphics) terminal as ones in which you must use XON/XOFF.

My suggestion is that there be a terminal bit that says "use XON/XOFF",
and that some convenient means be set up to send CTRL/Q and CTRL/S to
the application.  Perhaps CTRL/\ could be a "system controllifier", so
CTRL/\ S would be a logical CTRL/S, etc.

Don't flame about how this is being cretinous.  Instead, take this as
an exercise.  Suppose some worldwide glitch fried all non-XON/XOFF
terminals and you *had* to use an XON/XOFF terminal.  How would you
change the software so you can win?

Internally, the XON/XOFF bit should disable ALL padding (it is now
completely unnecessary) and an XOFF should be responded to immediately.
So at some interrupt level a CTRL/S should freeze the output driver.
I'm sure other people on the list have a better idea of how to do this
than I do.

The second issue is on a VT200 series terminal.  There, the wonderful
people at DEC decided that ESCAPE was an internal terminal/host protocol
character and not a user character.  I remember Tom Porcher telling me
what a great idea this was (cough).  What most of us do to work around
this lossage is to map backquote (`) to be ESCAPE since the backquote
key is where ESCAPE should be.  TOPS-10 has a "SET TTY ESCAPE n" to set
the ESCAPE key to be ASCII n (octal).

Neither of these are really hard, and it would be nice to be able to
flush CRTSTY, wouldn't it?

Much more time is wasted on the endless stream of whiney "Subject X
is not appropriate to this list, use list Y instead" that the whiners
feel must be sent to the entire list instead of merely to the offender.
There is a wonderful function called "DELETE" or "KILL" in most mail
reading programs which allows the fast excision of uninteresting messages
from a mail file.

Personally, I happen to be interested in the issue of TCP/IP on KS's in
general and of the various networking options available.  Not everybody
is going to be conveniently located to an IMP.  It might be worthwhile
to have a unified ITS/TOPS-20 KS TCP/IP project to avoid needless wheel
reinvention.

I know that the TOPS-20 TCP/IP is badly out of tune in most systems; Stanford
has been able to performance improvements that at times are an order of
magnitude.  I haven't yet seen a good assessment of the ITS TCP/IP.  My
impression from the west coast is that ITS' TCP is mediocre.  It doesn't
seem to handle hosts coming in through gateways well.  Of course, KLH didn't
have much time to work on it, and the overall quality of the hardware
interfaces is questionable.

We PDP-10 fans need to work together on common software projects.  There are
entirely too few of us left to be fighting these OS holy wars.  I WOULD like
to see some talk about what we can do to have a KS TCP that supports various
funky networking environments (like TOPS-20 multinet but better) and that
can be fit in to any of the current PDP-10 OS's.

NUMCYL should be ^D821, as far as I can remember, not to try
to overwrite the maintainance cylinder, which TOPS-10 woun't
allow you to do (that's why I never bothered to correct that
bug).

Hackers,

It has been suggested that it might be a good idea to teach an ITS course
during IAP this year.  We have done this twice before with somewhat mixed
results.  A few sessions were quite memorable, and a few were dogs.  Before
I decide if I want to front for this again this year, I would like to hear
from some other people.  Specifically I want to hear:

Things people want to learn about.

Opinions about what has worked in the past.

Volunteers who would enjoy teaching about something.

Ways of using this to burn excess machine cycles on our many (!) ITS
machines.  (Student project ideas?)

OK, I made a set of tapes for MRC.  Sure enough, -after- making the tapes I
got Peter's message, and that code is -inconsistent- with everything else I
have seen about formatting RM03's!

Well, I'm not about to hack any more on this now, so we will just mail off
the tapes as they are now.  If MRC has some trouble formatting his ITS
pack, it should be a simple matter to mail him a little patch to let him
try it the way Peter's code does it.

TOPS-20 TCP/IP in the DEC and PANDA monitors support the AN20, NIA20,
and CI20 interfaces.  Stanford has support for the MEIS, CMU has support
for TTY lines, but I wouldn't use TTY lines on a 2020.

I suspect that if anyone does TOPS-20 TCP/IP for a 2020 it will be me,
and I'm presently not motivated to do it.

I guess the real question is, how Small a Matter of Programming is it
to get the TCP/IP code running on the 2020 ? Is this something that is
on anyones list of things to do anytime soon? How big is it really and 
would it fit on the machine easily ? Would it hog the machine so badly
that nobody would be able to use it ?

What types of communications devices does tops-20 tcp/ip know how to use ?

Doug

P.S. Maybe running it would be better with the memory on the 2020 taken
up to 1024K ? Peter, what i the status of that effort ?

Thanks.

Yes, TOPS-20 has TCP/IP, but not for 2020's.  It's a Small Matter of
Programming to port the 2060 TCP/IP to a 2020 (mostly getting it all
to fit in an 18 bit address space).

We are looking at a number of options for medium speed comm from my 2020
to a local friendly arpanet site. This site has mentioned that they may
be able to hang me on their local ethernet if I can arrange to get there
from my place. What I need to figure out is :

1. How best to get a medium to high speed link there.
2. How to connect it to the 2020 such that I have TCP/IP support for
   mail, telnet (in and out), etc.

The comm link is not that hard. I can run a leased line with modems on
both end. Commercialy available, hardware is cheap, monthly costs expensive.

I can run a microwave link in two hops using 27Ghz short haul gear. 
Commercialy available, hardware more expensive (but not a lot), monthly
costs cheap (almost nil). Hard rain or heavy fog will cut my bandwidth
way down at those frequencys, but I can run a 56kbps link easily.

The big problem is the 2020 end. I don't know a lot about the TOPS-20
TCP/IP facilities (do they exist ?). I think I have at least one 
KMC/DUP set here so that might be a good thing. That gives me a DDCMP
based link. Now how do I get that into an ethernet and become part
of their local net ?

OK, I have possibly finished the RM03 support.  I am not 100% confident
that this will work the first time since I have -never- seen adequate RM03
documentation.  Let me give you an example:

I only yesterday learned by examing a disk formatting program that you
supplied me with, that the RM03 has only a -single- word of header attached
to each sector.  If I hadn't discovered this, the formatting code in the
Salvager would certainly have failed to work.  Some minor reorganization in
the Salvager was required to deal with this.  I have no reason to believe
that there aren't other problems lurking here for the first RM03 ITS system
to trip over.

In any case I have now assembled all of the relevant binaries and printed a
set of documentation for your system.  I can write the tapes any time I
want, but I thought I would just double-check the configuration once before
I do:

System name:	PM (for PandaMonium)

Memory:		512K (a full house)

Disks:		RH11 with -one- RM03
		(Your system has two more, but they are none of ITS's
		 business)

Tape:		RH11/TM03
		(The drive is a TU45, which we have never tried with the
		 ITS magtape code, but we believe this will work fine
		 anyway.)

Terminals:	T00:	Console TTY (driven by 8080 front-end)
		(ITS does not have code to drive the KLINIK line)
		One DZ11 with five lines in use:
		T01:	4800 baud
		T02:	9600 baud, H19
		T03:	1200 baud, Dialup
		T04:	1200 baud, Dialup
		T05:	9600 baud
		(Two of these are known to be a VT100 and a VT125, but ITS
		 doesn't support those directly (amazingly enough).)
		T06: - T11:  Pseudo-TTY's

Say this is correct, and I will cut some tapes and mail the whole mess to:

   My guess is that AI is using an AN22, DEC's impterface (I couldn't resist
   that one!) for the 2020.

AI and MC use ACC LH/DH Unibus 1822 interfaces.

    I think the best way for a 2020 to get on Internet is to get a DN20-BA
    (also known as a KDP or KMC11/DUP11) and talk IP on that.  Unless you want
    to hack KMC11 microcode you'll be using DDCMP for the low level protocol.

This is a pretty reasonable approach, if you can find someone at the
other end that can speak DDCMP and knows how to be a gateway.
KMC/DUP11s are nice and cheap in the used market these days. I'd
imagine someone out there is using these things to connect 4.xBSD
vaxes with IP; I'd figure out their encapsulation and use it. Seems to
me DEC also makes a similar but newer frob that runs at much higher
speeds, if you can get a 56Kb line.

If the best you can do is a TTY line at 1200b, I'd agree with mark
about doing something else instead. Maybe even at 9600, if you
want remote login to work well.

    Another way of going IP is to buy a DEUNA from DEC and hook up to an
    Ethernet.

I would think an Interlan ethernet card would be a better bet. But now
you -really- have to have someone to talk to.

    There's also the question of ITS code.  I don't know whether or not
    ITS has a Multinet facility, but I sort of doubt it.

It doesn't. It's beginning to need it. There are some hassles but it's
not horribly hard. I hope we can do a little better than Multinet.
MIT will most likely do a driver for Interlan NI1010 ethernet cards,
and some possibility of a Proteon 10Mb ring driver.  The other things
which have been mentioned but we aren't at all likely to do are
DEUNAs, KDPs and some kind of TTY-line driver.

DCA is indeed requiring X.25 connections to PSNs (what IMPs are called
these days), replacing the old 1822 connection.  Internally, it all
becomes 1822, making the exercise somewhat silly, but it's all part of
the "international standardization" time-waste going on.

My guess is that AI is using an AN22, DEC's impterface (I couldn't resist
that one!) for the 2020.  There probably aren't many AN22's in the world,
and I'll bet that MIT has most or all of 'em!  This was an 1822 device,
and actually wasn't all that bad (it would have used on the late lamented
KC10 a.k.a. Jupiter).  The AN10 and AN20 (I/O bus for KA, KI, and KL) were
funky and their demise is no loss!

I think the best way for a 2020 to get on Internet is to get a DN20-BA
(also known as a KDP or KMC11/DUP11) and talk IP on that.  Unless you want

A KDP supports between 2K and 20K baud and is synchronous, so you'd have
no problem with a 9600 baud modem.  I've thought about hacking TOPS-20 so
TCP/IP runs on 2020's again and talk IP on my KDP instead of DECnet, but
not until I get a faster modem than the 1200 baud modem I'm using now.
DECnet is painful at 1200 baud, IP is unusable.  There's also the small
matter of having somebody to talk to...

The other thing to consider is whether or not IP is worth the cost of
running it.  Consider that:
 . for remote login, just dialing the host (or your friendly local PAD or TAC)
   will give you much better throughput than IP Telnet.  You can tolerate line
   noise (else nobody would use terminals with modems)
 . for file transfer, Kermit is probably faster than IP FTP
 . for electronic mail, Cafard works quite well and with a 1-hour call
   interval (which PANDA uses) there isn't that much of an impact on real
   time communications.

In the absence of a *fast* (at least 9.6K) line to PANDA, I have not felt
that motivated to go to IP.  PANDA does a lot of mail, since it's at the
hub of a USENET-like network with 5 members (and growing; the latest member
is NTT in Japan!), and it seems to have no problem handling the workload
at 1200 baud.  This is mostly because Cafard runs in the background with a
semi-dedicated modem.

Another way of going IP is to buy a DEUNA from DEC and hook up to an Ethernet.
There has been talk of packet radio around here and a little Ethernet between
the packet radio station and the 2020 might be the thing.

There's also the question of ITS code.  I don't know whether or not ITS has
a Multinet facility, but I sort of doubt it.  The interface to the IMP
driver may be fairly modular and well defined, but I suspect that ITS is
very much 1822-oriented and it would be a fair amount of work to fix it to
use some other encapulation.  This isn't a problem on TOPS-20; you just
have the problem of writing the driver and making it all fit.

Sorry for the length of this message.

By the way, I too am interested in hearing about RM03 support.

If they want X.25, I do have an X.25 PAD hardware system here that 
takes 16 erial lines and does all of the X.25 PAD and routing functions
for things like Telenet, Tymnet, etc. That might help things. 
What do you think ?

Networking over them phones might be vary easy if I can work out some
way to impliment SLIP (Serial Line IP) as Chris Torak at Maryland and
other unix folks have. I would still prefer to run on a leased line 
with it because of the line speed limitations on the phones. Anyone
know a lot about SLIP and such ?

I assume that hooking into an IMP is not a serial process ?

    The way AI is connected requires an IMP on the premises.  Perhaps you
    and MRC can get together and implement a facility for networking over
    phone lines.

It's worse than that; I think DoD requires you to use the new X.25
host-IMP protocol for any new installations, so all of the current
IMP driver stuff is worthless for new sites, even if you were able
to get the IMP slot and the wires.

Now that I have cleared out the basement of all the junk that collects

them ship it up here next week sometime. Given the delays for power and
such to be hooked up, it will be at least 30 days until it comes up.

Do you have any kind of word on ITS support of RM03 disks ? Initialy I will 
run tops-20 to let the system burn in, but I really can't wait to bring
up ITS.

Ref to Ethernet TCP/IP on ITS. Is there support for this now ? If so,
the easiest (?) thing for me to do to put the machine on the arpanet
would be to get a high speed link to the university of maryland, say
a 27 gig microwave, and bingo, no problems. If no support now, when do you 
expect that you might work on this ? 

By the way, are there any places other than MIT, Stupi (sweden) and 
soon Washington DC (me) that are or will be running ITS ? Anyone else
out there want to bring up a city ?

I assume that the sleeze of piggybacking chips has been considered and 
rejected. 

Do the KS10 memory boards that are in it decode the entire address or 
are they one bit short ? Since we are only talking about 1 bit, there
should be a pretty simple way to add that that.  If we can make that happen,
I may be able to get more KS10 memory boards (though at a price, no doubt)
and bring a machine up to >512kw for experimentation.

     To elaborate on Alan's remarks a bit, the significant factor is not
when users use more virtual memory than physical memory, but rather when
the total amount of virtual memory used by all the active processes in
their working sets exceeds physical memory.  In other words, you want the
sum of the private pages in the working sets of all the active processes
plus all the shared pages that are in the working set of some active
process.  You also need some number of free pages or at least readily
freeable pages so you can slurp stuff off the disk reasonably quickly.

     In general, TOPS-20 runs more users doing larger tasks better than
ITS, but this is an artifact of the TOPS-20 paging system and the fact
that most large TOPS-20 programs are carefully written to take advantage
of the way paging works.  On the other hand, ITS terminal I/O is probably
quite a bit more efficient, especially terminal input.  More significantly,
MACLISP and all MACLISP-based tools run much better on ITS than on TOPS-20.
The TOPS-20 conversion was poorly done and many of the things MACLISP does
to take advantage of the ITS pager were never converted to the TOPS-20
equivalents.  MACSYMA is a good example of a tool that loses big on TOPS-20.

     A good summary:
 . ITS: faster, more efficient, better support of MACLISP, good canonical
   terminal support.
 . TOPS-20: larger and slower, but with better virtual memory.
     None of this should be terribly surprising, since ITS is one of the
very first paged operating systems, and the designers of Tenex and TOPS-20
were able to learn from ITS' strong and weak points.  Unfortunately, they
did not adopt ITS' terminal handling...

    Is there enough info on Red Tape #1 to confirm that there is/is not
    a microcode limit on memory size ?

Well, I had to modify the microcode for ITS paging, so I've certainly had a
pretty good look at it!  The microcode and the micromachine believe in a
1024K address space everywhere we know of.

				       I have been told that ITS suffers
    from thrashing as it dies on heavy loads. If so, then the 1024kw
    hack would win. Certainly memory is cheap enough these days !
    maybe an MS10 memory board with 256k chips on it would do it.

Well, any machine thrashes when people try to use more virtual memory than
physical memory.  ITS does pretty good under a heavy load.  Certainly no
worse that 20X does.  (Pardon me, I just have to defend ITS from causual
slander!)  (Well, there was this microcode bug I fixed that caused a fair
amount of thrashing until a couple months ago...) 

I believe the hardware people have determined that larger chips on the same
board won't do the job, there needs to be a new board manufactured.  But it
is believed that that is the -only- limitation.

TU45:
        Our 2020 has a TU-45 / Tm03 and it works with the tu77
        code, without any problem.

Is there enough info on Red Tape #1 to confirm that there is/is not
a microcode limit on memory size ? I have been told that ITS suffers
from thrashing as it dies on heavy loads. If so, then the 1024kw
hack would win. Certainly memory is cheap enough these days !
maybe an MS10 memory board with 256k chips on it would do it.

P.S. If ITS starts supporting RM03 drives, it might be a good idea to
     put them on some of the MIT machines. Though they are only 80 megs
     (vs. 176 for RP06 drives) they are ultimately reliable and are
     available on the used market now for $400.00  Real Cheap Disk.

Seems that everyone wants the console off of my KA, but
I think I will keep it. Let me check with the folks I am working with on 
the 2020 and see if they have any around. They used to have a 
number of KA systems.

The hardware involved with running the serial link should not
be too bad. I have a number of KMC11 sets around here somewhere,
and maybe some DMC too. It is the code to handle the serial that I wonder
about. What does ITS know about in the way of comm devices for 
TCP/IP ?

Since the vax has a unibus it should be pretty easy (assuming that the
powers that be don't flip out) to put the same comm on eneevax that
DX has and then either get a leased line or put up antennas and 
run packet radio.

     So, when are we going to see an RM03/TU45 version of ITS?
There are some TU77-only hacks in TOPS-20 that don't apply for
TU45's; I don't know if ITS depends on any of these.

     There are very few 2020's which have less than a full house
of 512K.  Alan is right about the address lines going to 1024K,
but I'm not sure denser boards alone are enough; perhaps some
additional microcode hacks are needed.

     I think that the best way to do serial TCP/IP on a 2020 is
to get a synchronous interface (called a KDP, or also a DN20-BA;
it's a KMC11A plus a DUP11-DA).  You absolutely do *not* want to
use a DZ11 port.  You will have no cycles left on your machine to
do anything else.  A KDP is advertised as being 2 to 19.2 KB, but
I've used it with DECnet at as slow as 1200 baud.

     Can I have PM (for "Pandamonium") as the name for my
machine?  Actually, it's full TOPS-20 name is "4664 Pandamonium
Reigns!"...

PS: Doug, if you don't want your KA10 any more I will pay a few
hundred dollars for the console panel if it's in good condition.

In digging through a bunch of tapes from the 'old days' of 10 and 20
hacking, I find the following tapes around:

Red Tape #1  version 405
Red Tape #3  version 405

Red Tape #1  version 404 also exists

Sounds like we are in business. I just spoke with the folks there, and 
they agree that a 2020/512kw/DZ11E/dual RM03's/dual TU45's is a pretty
fair trade, so until it is on paper, that is what the config should be.

I sure hope no big wig decides to blow this deal.....sounds like fun !

Doug -

      The Red Pack is built from a Red Tape #1.  A Red Tape #3 (bootable
diagnostic tape) can be made from a Red Pack.  Most of the DECies don't
bother with Red Packs, they just use Red Tape #3's.

      It is generally possible to get ahold of one or the other, at least
underground.  Isn't there a Red Tape #3 in the DEC supply cabinet by the
machine?

Alan,

Thanks for the answers. I will be calling these people tomorrow to
get the configuration and shipping and such settled. Will advise
when I know when it will be installed. Should be a good party, and 
of course all are invited if they are in the DC area. Lets hope all
goes well.

I'm glad to hear that the RM03's will be supported; it may not go 
toward your phd, but it's good for a free dinner next time you are 
in Washington or I'm in Boston ! 

Does anyone have the Red Pack or Red Tape diagnostice for the KS10 ?

Thanks again,

Doug

    Well, it looks like there is a good chance that I will get a 2020 soon, 
    aince I have found a friend who owns a company who has one, and they 
    owe me a lot of favors. I need to ask some random questions to see
    if I can get ITS up on it here in Washington.

    1. How much memory do I have to have on it to run ITS ? Do I need a full
       512kw, or can it run on less. Alternativly, once I have the memory,
       how hard is it to make the machine address more than 512kw ?

Our machines all have 512K, but you can certainly run with 256K (at some
loss in performance).  You can't have more than 512K worth of memory
physically stuffed into the machine, although if denser boards were
manufactured the machine can address 1024K.

    2. Since I do not know the ITS internals at all, and have little time 
       right now to learn them, are there any souls that would be willing
       to help me get it running down here ? I can provide the machine, the 
       home for it ( my basement) and the power and cooling and such, 
       and as much time as I can squeak out. 

We can provide the software and directions that anyone can follow for
getting the machine initially running.  Beyond that, I don't know where you
can find additional hacker power.  Perhaps you can advertize somehow.

    3. Since I do not have a chaos net etc. here, will the sweden modifications
       to ITS be available to allow me to connect it to normal DZ11 ports 
       and such like that ? That way I could put dialups on it so that DC 
       area folk could use it.

We already support DZ11s.  I dial up to our 2020's all the time.

    4. What are the chances of having ITS support RM03 disks in addition to 
       RP06's ? The RM03's use single phase power and are thus much nicer
       to have in my basement than the RP06's. Also, the generate a lot
       less heat and noise. 

RM03 support is a small modification to the existing RP06 support.  MRC
also has RM03's so I'm already comitted to doing this.  I haven't done it
yet though.  (Hey, I'm supposed to be working on a Phd, not hacking ITS.)

    5. The University of Maryland has said that I can put the machine on the 
       internet through them if I can figure out some way to get some good
       communications from the house to the university. A serial line might
       be doable, or maybe even packet radio, but there would have to be some
       sort of serial line TCP/IP support to do this. Something like SLIP. 
       Does anyone know of that type of thing for ITS ? It would be nice
       to be on the arpanet...

Dunno about this.  Maybe one of the people I Cc'd will have an opinion.

    6. How much disk space does an ITS take up ?

A full set of sources for ITS and associated system programs (including
Emacs and MacLisp) will, I think, completely fill an RM03.  But there is no
reason for you to have all of those files in your filesystem as long as you
can get them from tape.  When you load up your filesystem, you will just
need to make some informed choices about what directories to tell DUMP to
skip.

    7. Does it support the TU45 tape drive ? That is what I would be
       getting. 

We have never tried a TU45, but I have been lead to believe that the
existing TU77 support will simply work.  (MRC also has a TU45.)

    8. I know that I like ITS, and want to see it stay alive, but I have 
       (unfortunately) very little time to hack with it anymore. What other
       folks in the DC area would like to have accounts on a local ITS ? 
       Is this project (pardon my asking; I'm the guy with the KA 10 in the 
       living room for heavens sake !!!) worth doing ? Are there enough people
       there to make this a winning event, or do I just tell these guys to 
       send me the cash rather than the machine ?

...?

    I should state that I am in great favor of the idea of ITS sites spreading 
    all over the world, bringing their wacky and wonderful message of free
    computrons to the massas, etc. It's just that if I bring the machine up
    and there is nobody to use it it will be a sad thing...

    By the way, has a naming convention for these missionary ITS machines
    been developed ? Do we keep the current MIT-__ to recall that MIT
    is the true source of the holy ITS ? If so, Devon has suggested that
    I get MIT-DX reserved, since it is close to the name of the company that 
    will actualy own the machine (Digital Express Inc.) and since DX 
    implies the remote nature of the machine from MIT. If there is going to
    be a new naming structure started, please let me know.

ITS machines have two letter names, so "DX" is now reserved in your name.
Many ITS programs will prefix that with "MIT-" and assume that that is also
an official name of the machine.  What you do about such programs are your
own business.

    Banzai !

suggestions....

I started loading the tapes to a new discpack, now with a ITS
monitor that handled the tm03.

Using Dump to load the filesystem is slower than using the TRAN
routine in the salvager. Why, 1, the comand LOAD MERGE NOASK
does not create directorys, so for each new directory i had to
create that. 2, logging writes to sysstem directorys on a 300
baud console terminal is SLOW.

What did i do wrong?..

Sporadical bughalts, KS->8080 flag 24 ..

Ethernet tcp-ip for KS,

After the work with the ki/imp code/32016 mikro/ethernet for
t10, i think we have learned how.. But we have to learn about
ITS first....... Produced a lot of crashes yesterday on the KS,
but
after running DEC diagnosis we found a hardware problem.

I have started to add modem control/autobaud for the DZ lines
so we can hook it to the terminal switch.

(We are still waiting for OUR KS from Per Hjerppe, we are currently
 using a KS that belongs to the stockholm University Computing
 center.)

There is a lot of people here who call themselves "hackers",
but aren't. They are usually referred to as "snackers" (i.e.
"talkers"-the Swedish word "snack" means "(nonsense) talk").
They only use computers for writing a lot of nonsense in KOM
(a teleconferencing/electronic mail system). They copy other
people's program, and boast about how clever they are. If we
give them full privileges, and a program to change the job's
PPN to [1,2] (the TOPS-10 way of bypassing file protections)
they will use it to change system files without knowing what
they are doing-trying to play "clever system programmer"-but
if we remove the program, or hack the monitor so the program
doesn't work (which is what we did, since most of them waste
disk space by making copies of everything they can find, and
especially the privilege program) they complain, but they do
not bother to find out another way to do what they want.

Do we need to protect ourselves against them? No. If there's
no teleconferencing system where they can talk, they woun't
use the machine.

What do we need protection for? First, because some crackers
can't think of anything better than causing damage. The most
disgusting cracker I know of goes around asking people if he
may use their terminals for a second, and then he erases all
their files, or something similar. Second, because we woun't
have our own modems, and we don't want to have Mr. Anonymous
blocking QZ's modems during office hours.

    We have no network to the KS, the only network we have
    around is a local ethernet, shared by tcp/ip, DECnet and
    xerox xns talking devices.

I thought you were going to bring up Ethernet TCP-IP on your KS.
MIT will be doing that eventually (right now they are using
Chaosnet hardware instead of Ethernet hardware, because it was
easier to program and there were a lot of Chaosnet interfaces
lying around).

By the way, it's customary to store the ITS BIN and ITS ERR files
on the . directory, in case you need to refer to them later.  If for
some reason the @ ITS file gets bashed, you can go through the DSKDMP
procedure of loading the ITS BIN file again and recover.  It's
customary to name these files ITS nnnBIN and ITS nnnERR, where nnn
is the low three digits of the version number, and link .;ITS BIN
to .;ITS nnnBIN where nnn is the latest version that is known to work.
Thus you could
  :MIDAS .;ITS 580BIN,,.;ITS 580ERR_SYSTEM;ITS 1580/E

For the same reason, I like to keep a known working .;@ ITS and
SYS:ATSIGN HACTRN on the BACKUP; directory, to ease recovery if for some
reason the .  or SYS directory should go away (I think in all my years
with ITS I only got to use those files twice).

If these fine points of system administration are confusing to you new
ITS sites, don't worry about them for now, but save this message for
later.

Is you machine actually on a network?

There's some ancient code to cope with non-network machines, but it is
undoubtably broken.  The easiest thing to do in this case would be to
build a fake host table with on entry in it and bash the routine that
looks up the local host address to just return a constant number.  If
you need this, let me know, it's a two line COMSAT patch and a few
lines of text to construct the fake host table.  Tell me which version
of COMSAT you have though.

Once you get onto a network you can revert to the normal code, maybe.
The code that gets your IP address inside COMSAT assumes you're on the
Arpanet (net 10.0.0.0) because up until now all ITS machines were if
they were TCP/IP live at all.

    does it work?

It's easier for you to test it than for me to test it.

We'll send you a new microcode and system in a while; there are still some bugs
in one-proceed that it would be nice to iron out.  I guess there is lots of
fun you can have in the meantime with the system you have.

Message-ID: <[AI.AI.MIT.EDU].69828.860714.ALAN>

The good news is that the Swedish KS10 ITS is up and running.  

The bad news is that both of the ITS distribution kits I sent out have this
(non-fatal) problem:  The system binary doesn't have the tape drive support
assembled in.  This isn't fatal, because the Salvager has tape drive
support, and the kit includes a complete set of sources, but it does mean
that the directions I gave to use DUMP running under timesharing to load
most system files won't work...

To those of you with distribution kits (does this list reach any of the
relevant people in Australia?) here is what to do about it:

The immediate solution is to use the TRAN routine in the Salvager to load
-all- the dump tapes.  That is, after using TRAN to load the MINSYS tape,
mount the first dump tape and do TRAN$G again.  TRAN will not clobber any
file it finds already on disk, so the vital files loaded from the MINSYS
tape will not be touched.  Repeat this for all dump tapes.  This isn't the
most pleasant way to load the filesystem, but it will work.

Someday, after you have played with ITS for a while, you will probably want
to use your tape drive.  Like perhap you might want to backup your
filesystem.

In order to get a new version of ITS assembled that has tape drive support
you should first edit the configuration file kept in SYSTEM;CONFIG >.  Find
the section of the configuration file that describes your system.  (It's a
page that starts "IFE MCOND ZZ,[", where ZZ is the name of your machine.)
Insert the two lines:

DEFOPT NMTCS==1		;Number of magtape units
DEFOPT TM03S==1		;TM03/RH11 Unibus tape controller

somewhere on the page (I put them after the line that begins 
"DEFOPT RH11P").

Now you need to assemble a new ITS.  The tape for SI includes two newer
versions of ITS that if assembled, won't run with the microcode they have.
(I told Peter over the phone that this wasn't the case, but I was wrong.)
So they will need to first delete the files SYSTEM;ITS 1580 and
SYSTEM;ITS 1581 from their filesystem.  The tape for FU does not have this
problem.

Next you need to increment the system version number.  The system version
number is simply the version number of the file SYSTEM;ITS.  Since you have
not changed this file, you need to change the version number manually.
Simply rename the file.  (For example, on SI rename SYSTEM;ITS 1579 to
SYSTEM;ITS 1580.)

Now assemble a new system.  Type (to timesharing DDT):

:MIDAS SYSTEM;ITS/E

when MIDAS (the assembler) asks:

MACHINE NAME = 

answer by typing the name of your machine ("SI" or "FU" or whatever)
followed by a carriage return.  When MIDAS is done it leaves two files in
-your- directory: ITS BIN and ITS ERR.  The ERR file is just a record of
what MIDAS typed to the terminal during assembly.  The BIN file is the new
binary.

To dump out a system as .;@ NITS, repeat the procedure you used to create
.;@ ITS.  In brief, the steps are:

Take the system down and get into DSKDMP.

L$.;DDT<cr>		to get a fresh DDT into memory.

T$ME;ITS BIN<cr>	loads the ITS binary you just made from directory
			ME. This also starts DDT in case you want to patch
			anything. 

$U			returns you to DSKDMP, since you have no patches.

M$.;SALV BIN<cr>	merges in a copy of the Salvager.

D$.;NITS<cr>		dumps the whole mess on disk as .;@ NITS.

Now when you boot ITS, use NITS instaed of ITS and you can use your tape
drive.

I don't know if you're the appropriate person, but maybe you know

We're trying to get rid of our 2060, I believe we have bid it out
to random used equipment folks and are waiting for responses. The
price would be $25K (that would be free and clear, eg. you pay
shipping and insurance and de-installation etc.)

If you think there is anyone around MIT who would be interested
get them in touch with me. It's so cheap because that's what we've
been quoted. We're getting rid of it because the maintenance is so
high and it was never much used here at BU. It is all late model
stuff. Timing is open, we need some notice to move people off of
it and get in replacement equipment.

I guess nobody inside DEC is interested in hearing about bugs in their KS10
microcode by now.  That's a pity, because I just found a pretty funny one.  

The microcode for BLT treats BLTting a block from foo to foo+1 as a special
case that it can do quickly.  This is, of course, very important given that
95% of all the BLTs in the world are used precisely for this purpose.

Well, it isn't careful about the case where BLT is being used by XCTR (or
PXCT for you 20X hackers) to move a block of data from address foo in the
system's address space, to address foo+1 in the user's address space!  The
poor user's block gets a bunch of copies of the first word of the system's
block.

Of course I found this the hard way.  The .RCHST call screws up if you ask
for the results starting in accumulator 2 (but in no other case!).  And of
course there is a place in DDT that does exactly this.  I wonder how many
other subtle bugs have been caused by this.

The ITS KL10 microcode doesn't seem to have this problem, I presume that
means that the DEC KL10 microcode doesn't have it either.

    Its highly likely the events are related.  I found a scrap of paper stuck
    to the head assembly inside the drive that was probably left there due to
    swapping packs around many times.  (It looks like the corner of an adhesive
    label of some kind.  My guess it was torn off of a pack cover when a pack

    John:  Where did you finally spot damage?  Do we need a new pack?  Are the
    heads damaged?  It would be nice if we can get DEC to replace the pack if
    it is damaged.

Of course the crash is related to the swap (goddamnit JTW).  If the
drive hadn't been moved to XX it would never have had an LCS pack put in
it.  LCS puts gummed labels two deep on the sides of the pack cover and
never removes the old ones completely.  For grins go look at the cover
for XX's drive 5.

	Can't we fold this into INFO-ITS?
    INFO-ITS is an extremely low-volume mailing list.  It is for spreading
    information that ordinary ITS users and programmers might want to know.
    Like when a new device is installed (like LP7:), or a new Midas library
    is written, or a new machine is installed, or a new system call is
    installed or improved.
    KS-ITS is for people who are interested in the project of getting 2020s
    installed at MIT running ITS.  When I got the KS10 microcode to do
    ITS-style paging, I sent mail to KS-ITS.  The people on INFO-ITS I
    didn't bother until they could log in.
    A lot of mail that has gone to KS-ITS in the last few months should
    have been sent to BUG-ITS.  Like if AI crashes in some novel way,
    people send mail to KS-ITS "because AI is a KS", even though BUG-ITS is
    the proper recipient.
    The people on KS-ITS were interested in keeping in touch with a "good
    hack", which is distinct from both BUG-ITS and INFO-ITS.

gumby, the next time you ask 4 people's opinion about making the sort of
major change you suggested, why not wait until more than 1 replies before
deciding what to do? i have just spent 2 hours undoing the confusion you
created by going ahead with this merger after only one response. among
other things, you completely omitted the BUG-ITS archive.  fortunately i
discovered a BUG-ITS list member who hasn't logged in for the past few
days, and so was able to recover the lost msgs. i have also unmerged the
INFO-ITS and KS-ITS archives. also, it's considered courteous, when you
insist on rashly forging ahead in this fashion, to inform -all- the list
members involved; you only told those people on KS-ITS who were not on
INFO-ITS:

i agree with alan -- the INFO-, BUG-, and KS-ITS have distinct purposes and
should be kept that way. now that the KSs run ITS, a lot of the discussion
previously carried on on KS-ITS should move to BUG-ITS or other more
appropriate lists, but that's another story.

I would like to suggest that KS-ITS isn't the proper mailing list for this
discussion of the administration of MC.  I presume that people put
themselves on this mailing list because they were interested in following
the progress of getting KS10's up and running ITS.  Much of the recent
discussion surrounding the MC/MX name swap strained this definition a bit,
and this discussion of access to MC's NAMES file strikes me as beyond the
boundary.  There -is- a mailing list of people who are interested in this
issue:  User-A@MC.  I would request the the rest of this discussion take
place there.

I was just talking to someone who maintains a moderate-sized list
elsewhere that has local redistribution to MIT via MC.  Now that MC
alias KS is not easy to log in to, he cannot fix problems which result
from expansions here, yet not everyone at the MIT side even knows that
they are on a local redistribution, much less can fix their entries
without accidentally bashing something.

In addition, with the exception of the people with KS PWORD entries,
no one can update .MAIL.;NAMES > without doing a rather lengthy
transfer over the net.  Over MLDEV from AI, this take only a few
seconds and doesn't both me much, but this guy in California certainly
doesn't want to FTP the entire file back and forth...  (He didn't even
mention timing screws, but such a lengthy update cycle makes them more
likely, too.)

Would it make sense to make EMACS runnable on KS when not-logged-in?
I realize that this opens up another whole can of worms, namely that
it then becomes difficult to know who last changed a file.
Furthermore, EMACS can do things like delete files (I must assume that
malicious people are still around).  Thus it's not entirely clear to
me that this is a great idea.

On the other hand, it would save a good deal of traffic, hence load,
for quick occasional modifications, and would allow people far away
to update NAMES > without taking all afternoon.  Presumably, we
wouldn't wind up with a user community on KS, since no one would be
logged in, and I would guess that the load of an occasional EMACS
would be lower than that of shipping NAMES > back and forth for each
mod.

	As I was saying before I lost completely due to connections spazzing, I
    have found tourists hopping to OZ through AI, in spite of the message that
    tells them not to. One claimed that his tourist advisor (who shall be
    nameless) told him to do so.
i think this was a fellow i gave an account to (see my msg of a few minutes
ago to USER-A -- interested KS-ITS folks can look in the USER-A archive).
i do not believe in that fictive creature the "tourist advisor". some
tourists figure out that i granted their accounts, and therefore direct
their questions to me before asking lab members at random.  i am reasonably
sure i have not told any tourists that nethopping through AI is an approved
activity.
     ...Maybe it's time to set some definite standard as to what can be done
    where. We also need to start making more use of the other two KS's; this
    would be greatly easier if they had TCP/IP.  Do we have any volunteers to
    write the Ethernet driver code? WE apparently have the boards.
i think JTW was kinda sorta considering thinking about contemplating
working on this. or something like that. but i could be wrong.
	I would suggest putting mail forwarding and the CHAOS/TCP protocol
    gateway on the two ARPANet connected machines (I assume there's no easy way
    to tell what percentage of these service requests go to machiens outside
    MIT, in which case these are the right machines; internal MIT conversion
    should go through the other two).  All users (Lab and tourist) on the other
    two machines; nethopping should probably also be down through the other two
    machines.
i would find it exceedingly inconvenient to use a machine other than AI. it
might help to have ML and MD both up (gumby just brought ML back up after
its use by lcs&dec for a week or so) so that people -can- move to them. a
lot of people are quite willing to move to ML now, as long as they can use
AI when a direct arpa connection is necessary, but are wary of moving to MD
because we keep saying that it will be the first to go when we need parts.

In fact, the logon message for AI tells people not to nethop.

    Just now, I tried doversend-ing something, and it complained that it
    could not reach MC, which was down.  Finger, however, reports one user
    on MC and tells me that it timed out waiting for MX.  I wonder if
    doversend is looking for the old MC instead of the new one.

No, it really was trying for the KL.  The problem is that there are a
whole slew of programs (and PROMs, god save us all) which just -know-
that chaos 1440 is the address of the ITS running the Dover spooler.
So we didn't move that service yet.  KL really is down right now.  So
the only out and out bug is that DOVERSEND has all this hardwired
knowledge of names and addresses (so much for software engineering).

I guess we are going to be running a dover spooler on KS, at which
point all the people with the burned PROMs will lose.  But they are
losing anyway, since KL is down and may never come back up again.

	Ok, at 8AM tomorrow Joe Ricchio and I will power down the IMPs
and switch the interface adapters. Alan is thinking about what needs to
happen on the ITS front, and SRA will be present to lend a hand with
COMSAT and HOSTS/Domain Name work.
	When we come back up, the KS will think it is MC and will be
on the KL's old IMP port; it will not have the KL's CHAOS address
since the KL's CHAOS address is on a virtual subnet. This is
unfortunate but unavoidable; people on CHAOS sites should get a new
HOSTS file ASAP after things come back up. The KS will be up first;
once the bombs stop falling we will work on bringing the KL up as MX
on DM's old IMP port.

This particular time, what we seem to need most of all is an M8530
Memory Controller board. If parts really aren't a problem for you guys,
maybe we're in business. Knowing the whereabouts of a KL wizard
is bound to be a great help, either to get things fixed, or just
to ask questions. However, there is essentially -no- money available
to keep this machine running, so it would be good if he was in it
for fun..

In case it is of use, we have a guy here on staff who knows KL's like the
back of his hand. He worked for DEC for many years keeping most of the
D.C. area KL's running and he really does know what is going on. 

I mentioned to him last week that your KL was coming off of maintenance,
and that we might want to take a trip up there some time to fix it, and he
sounded like it might be fun. Certainly spare parts for it should not be a problem.

So if this sounds interesting, and you would like us to come up and take 
a shot at it, let me know. I am sure that it would take MIT months to
arange things formaly, so maybe it would be best if we just sliped in quietly,
fixed it, and then disapeared into the night.....

I think the load of snarfing a mail file off a KS via Chaosnet and
reading it with Zmail is sufficiently low, and the amount of disk
space involved is sufficiently small, that Pete's best bet is to
keep his mail file on MX after it is in solid service and renamed to MC.

    To: cent@MIT-MC.ARPA
    When MC becomes the KS, I don't quite grok how it's going to work.
    Will users still be allowed/encouraged to have some place to receive
    their mail files on that machine, or will it simply be used to forward
    mail in all cases to other hosts?  I.e., can I have some equivalent of
    MC:PSZ;PSZ MAIL collect on new MC?  I am willing to keep my BABYL file
    and mail archives, etc., elsewhere, but it seems silly to have mail
    come to MC just to be sent on again, and running ZMAIL seems like the
    right time to snarf the MAIL file off MC.
    Do you know what the regimen will be?  If not, who should I ask?
    Thanks.  --Pete
you have a couple options.

you can continue to let your mail collect on the KL (where it is currently
going). see your inquir entry -- all ITS inquir entries claiming MC as a
net-address have been changed to KL. after the switch the KL/MX will only
be on the chaosnet, so mail to PSZ@MC would then take one more hop to land
in your mail file on the KL. the KL is no longer on contract, though, so
the next time it breaks severely, it's gone; also dumps to tape are not to
be expected (though TY may find some spare time to do one occasionally),
so there's no guarantee of file back ups.

you could, i suppose, let your mail live on the KS (which after the switch
will be MC). this is not encouraged because we're going to make the KS
fascist for an ITS. e.g., PWORD from everywhere. use of the KS will be
discouraged because its principal job will be shoving mail around the
network. active use of it will cut into the efficiency of this.  snarfing
your mail file off it onto a lispm would not be as bad as logging into the
ITS and reading your mail there, but...

you could make your local mail address be ML or MD. these will not be on
the arpanet directly (just the chaosnet), so your mail will make the extra
hop mentioned above. on the other hand, these ITSs will be the standard
friendly type, so you are welcome to store your various archives etc there.
please note that dumping these doesn't quite work yet, but moon thinks he
understands the problem and will hack the code more in a day or two, so it
will work soon. there is the additional consideration that MD is our source
of spare parts, if/when the other three start to disintegrate.

you could make AI your mail address. it's on the arpanet. it's like the KA
used to be for system load/computron shortage. right now it's a bit tight
on space (i need to get around to running a GFR).

I believe this is the bug where it sees DCP@SCRC, sends SCRC to the domain
resolver, the latter blows out because it's broken and only works half the
time, so Comsat decides to ignore the host and do local delivery.  Obviously
this is a high priority bug, I understand SRA is working on it.

AI has a tu77 and is dumped regularly. it will probably need a GFR sometime
in the pretty near future.

MX has been dumped for a week. tonight some lossage turned up during the
incremental, so moon's code probably needs more massaging. 
    as far as i can tell, all the unbackedup files -were- dumped.  however,
somewhere between OAF; and SRA;, DUMP (actually MOON;ND) stopped diddling
backed-up bits. the tape (204) is readable -- see
    AI:CENT;.OAF LIST (MX:OAF;ENERGY DSNLST) second-to-last marked
    AI:CENT;.SRA LOGIN (MX:SRA;SRA LOGIN) next-to-first unmarked
    AI:CENT;.ZVONA LOGIN (MX:ZVONA;ZVONA LOGIN) next-to-last file dumped
(next-to files used for readability). this should be worked on. note that
this dump was on GUT's drive with bpi forced to 1600.

ML had its first full and incremental today (both via GUT), and apparently
came through with flying colors. i got faked out by the tininess of the
file system, and thought ND had spazzed at EOT and i needed to CDUMP onto a
second tape, but it was just the (current) lack of files.

MD does not yet have a working version of ND, so it can't yet be dumped.
this should be fixed. for that matter, MD doesn't have EMACS yet -- someone
please move it. for that matter, whoever has moved EMACS onto the newer KSs
must have a dumped version or something, because i had to make the general
links in SYS2; -- ya gotta remember these things.

i can't say anything about the KL -- i think ty might be dumping it kind of
occasionally in his spare time. people who care about their files should
move them off (current) MC.

There are now -five- machines running ITS at MIT, more than have ever
existed simultaneously before.  There is the MC KL10, and four KS10's named
AI, MX, ML, and MD.  

The MC KL10 is off maintenance contract as of the first of this month, so I
suppose its days are numbered.  At some point before the KL10 passes on to
that great machine room in the sky, the MC KL10 and the MX KS10 will swap
their names, and we will plug the new MC KS10 into the old MC's Arpanet
port.  This assures that as far as the outside world is concerned, there
will always be an ITS named MC at that Arpanet address, performing mail
service functions for MIT.  (Let's not get into the hair we will be going
through to make all the mailing lists in the world continue to work.)

The KL10 will remain available for all those who wish to continue to use
it, under the name MX.  When the KL10 retires, the name MX will be retired
with it.

Various other owners of KS10's around the world will be receiving KS10 ITS
distribution tapes in the mail soon.  The last machine we booted (MD) was
built by a volunteer using the printed instructions we plan to include with
our ITS distribution kits.

still have it, they might be willing to let it go real cheep.

They are a combination surplus computer dealer, semiconductor parts

Most likely this has already been covered, but did anyone check to see
if a Foonly or Systems Concepts DEC-10 look alike was available to take

    	I see that MX's LHDH is now working. What was wrong?

There were some jumpers that needed to be changed to set the interrupt
level.  (I only set the dip switches initially.)  JTW figured out what the
problem was.  DPH wielded the soldering iron.

I stole TSTGW's Arpanet address and gave it to MX.  This should fix
the mailer weirdness.  I'm -not- going to (officially) tell the NIC;
people outside MIT shouldn't know or care about the change.

Since I don't feel particularly masochistic, the change won't go into
effect until snarfed by the 4am XX batch job.

MX and ML have undergone a mutual brain transplant. MX is now the KS
between the LHDH bay and the 8N-HUBs, while ML is now the KS over beside
MD, near the dover.  MX is (still) running ITS; its LHDH doesn't work
for some reason, but JTW et al are planning to work on this. ML and MD
are still running Twenex, but that won't last.

Oh, yeah, moon has the RTAPE software almost working (i think), although
not yet explained to me. which means the not-AI KSs will soon be dumpable
despite lack of personal tape drives.

I have never actualy looked at them, since I have not been in their computer
room (typical large company security paranoia). I could ask them what they
are like and what they plan to do with them. They are flushing them because
they both went down one week, and the entire companies data base was down. 
The CE's took 3 weeks to get them running, in which time IBM had taken an
order on, shipped, installed, and tested 2 4361 based systems. IBM was
in, and Honeywell out. I will check. 

By the way, I am looking to get rid of my KA10 system and upgrade to something
a little smaller and easier to play with. Unfortunately I can not come up
with the $5,000 that is required for a 2020 system on which I would run
ITS here in Washington D.C. which is certainly what I would like to do.
Anyone want to buy a complete KA10 system ??? (snicker...)

A question that has slightly better chances of being answered, does anyone
know where I can get a 2020 Real Cheep ???

But not, unfortunately, ML's sysconsole.  Unless I mis-remember, there
isn't any room in the bottom of the bays full of MINITS boxes.

    then later, when we get the right cables and ML comes up, perform brain

    this will have the feature that both LHDHs can fit in the bay, with minimal
    UNIBUS cable length to each CPU (there is no good place to put MX's LHDH,

Looks good to me.  I -hate- moving stuff around, but this even has the

a proposal; i think other people have discussed it, but it needs to get
into mail:

at some point, relatively soon, switch the AI tape drive and the LHDH bay,
thus giving the arrangement:
	TU77	AI	LHDHbay	  ML	MINITS boxes	MD-->

		VT52	AI sys	  little    ML sys
			console	  table	    console	MX-->
this provides, among other features, better access to the tape drive.  AI's
sysconsole can be pushed back some so that the output drops onto the bottom
of the LHDH bay (the ROLM modems now there would have to be moved
somewhere), which would give a little more space between the bays and the
disks.

then later, when we get the right cables and ML comes up, perform brain
surgery to provide the following situation:
	TU77	AI	LHDHbay	  MX	MINITS boxes	MD-->

		VT52	AI sys	  little    MX sys
			console	  table	    console	ML-->
this will have the feature that both LHDHs can fit in the bay, with minimal
UNIBUS cable length to each CPU (there is no good place to put MX's LHDH,
for the current value of MX).  brain surgery will involve switching 2 RP06
packs and changing the chaosnet addresses on the 2 machines involved; in
other words, it would be trivial.

MIT-MX came up for the first time this morning.  (You can supdup there
right now, but you won't find much when you get there...)  There are still
some problems with the technology for creating new ITS systems from
scratch, but it mostly works.  Hopefully after doing the next two (ML and
MD) things will be pretty smooth.

All kind of worms are crawling out of the woodwork because of various
programs that -know- that all ITS machines are named "AI", "MC", "ML", or
"DM".  It should take another days hacking to stomp them all...

this is the KS nearest the dover, with sysconsole nearest the KSs.
as soon as alan makes a pack, we'll have another ITS.

MD.LCS.foo.bar (the KS next to MX) is forced to wait until we get more

OK this is it.  The migration of ITS system files from MC to AI is

having just moved Bug-ITS and Bug-DDT to AI, I thought I would test them by
informing you all of how this migration will work.  I expect to have most
of the SYS*** directories moved to AI by tomorrow.  If you have some
question about the status of a particular directory, look for a file on
that directory named " MOVED TO AI ".  If that file exists, then the file
you are looking for now lives on AI, edits on MC are likely to be lost.  If

    The problem with doing it this way (using a device) is that you have to pay
    device startup overhead every time you invoke the device.  That might be a
    couple of seconds.

What about JOBREU?

Or we could have a call like CHAOSO which gives you a pair of channels
to a jobdev.

    There are several distinct problems that need to be solved.  In
    decreasing order of priority:

    1) COMSAT needs its address space back, so the moby HOSTS3 table
       has to get out of COMSAT's address space.

    2) COMSAT needs to be able to do name<->address stuff for domains.

    3) COMSAT needs to be taught to do sophisticated things with all this
       new mail related stuff that is part of the domain spec.  It also
       has to preserve the string-format host name until actually sending
       the message, as opposed to the current practice of immediately
       converting to a HOSTS3 address.  New timeouts have to be installed
       (since some formerly trivial operations can now take minutes), some
       amount of parallelism has to take place with the resolver (ie,
       COMSAT should go do something else while resolver is grinding
       away), scads of other things that I haven't thought of yet.

    Considerations:

    Task (1) needs to be done ASAP**2, if not sooner.  Task (2) needs to
    be done ASAP but COMSAT will at least be a functional mailer again
    while this is under development.  Task (3) will take a while, nobody
    has really done much of this anywhere yet and the ideas themselves are
    still being debugged.

Separating out task 3 seems like a good idea to me.

    Proposed sollution:

    Step one is to take CSTACY's NETWRK clone routines 

I'm not sure what you mean by this but my best guess is "CSTACY" was
a typo for "COMSAT" here.

						       and adapt them for
    whatever high-speed comunication channel COMSAT is going to use to
    talk to its resolver (note that I do not say -the- resolver; if
    necessary I am willing to put up with having COMSAT have its own
    private resolver and cache until we can work out and code the details
    of a high bandwidth method of sharing the cache with the DQ: device or
    whatever incarnation the non-COMSAT resolver takes).  Current top of
    the list of things to try is a core link, if that doesn't work out
    there are other things we can try.  For a core link to work we need
    some way of making sure there is something on the other end of the
    core link; ideas here are normal USR: frobbing, a special system call
    to set up a core link and boot the other end of it if not already
    present, or maybe the old DM .DEMON stuff.

    In any case, once there is some communiction channel, COMSAT uses it
    instead of mapping in HOSTS3.  As a first step, the thing on the other
    end will not be a resolver at all, just a job that grovels through
    HOSTS3 and returns an appropriate answer.  This should be a two hour
    hack, modulo the core link (or whatever) code.

CStacy already wrote a version of the DQ device that uses HOSTS3 instead of
resolving and commented-out code in Comsat that talks to that version of
the DQ device.  The first thing to try is probably to turn this on and see
what has to be done to make it work.  I looked at it a little a month or two
ago and didn't see any gross travesties, but I couldn't spend the time to
turn it on and watch what happened to make sure it was working reliably.

The problem with doing it this way (using a device) is that you have to pay
device startup overhead every time you invoke the device.  That might be a
couple of seconds.  A small cache of host name/address pairs inside Comsat might
alleviate that for the time being (we're talking here just about the quickest
way to get Comsat back on its feet).

Probably a job inferior to Comsat communicating through shared memory, like the
way XMAILR works (or used to work when I knew about it), would be the best way
to give Comsat a resolver that is always in existence and doesn't have to wait
for locks held by some user.  This probably implies that this resolver doesn't
use the same cache as the resolver that users use, or else the locking is done
carefully so that things don't get hung up.  Once it's an inferior job you don't
gain anything by using a core link.  The small cache of host name/address pairs
might still be worthwhile, since it's so easy to do.  If the DQ-device code is
not totally bankrupt, and I have no judgement about that one way or the other,
it's probably quite easy to make it work both as a JOB device handler and as
an inferior job taking requests from its superior Comsat.

    Second step will be to replace the fake resolver with a real resolver.
    Part of the reason for doing the fake resolver is to have an easy way
    of backing out of losing resolver code; just punt the resolver and put
    the fake resolver back up (something a non-hacker can do, so that you
    aren't dependent on me being present 24 hours per day to get the mail
    through).  In fact, the cannonical resolver boot file should just be a
    link to the resolver of the week (or day or minute...).

Agreed.

    At this point COMSAT will be doing the same things it used to do with
    host tables but be doing them with domains.  Experimental evidence
    from XX (who's MMAILR is currently at this stage) shows that this
    isn't that all horrible.  It could be a lot better, but it works and
    the mail does get through.

Once we get this far we'll be happy for a while.

[Forgive the wide distribution and length, I want to make sure nobody
 comes up to me later and flames about being left out.]

As some of you know, I now have the twenex domain code basicly done,
or at least in a state where I can leave it alone for a few months.
So now I can start working on COMSAT.

Premise:

There are several distinct problems that need to be solved.  In

1) COMSAT needs its address space back, so the moby HOSTS3 table
   has to get out of COMSAT's address space.

    Re:   Death of MC
        Given that MC and AI may die at any moment....
stavros, thank you for your concern and kind suggestion, but you are
confused. the semi-original AI (that is, the KA-10 rather than the PDP-6)
was flushed 3 years ago. the hardware was given to a bunch of hackers from
Concourse (an MIT alternative undergrad program) -- after it walked across
the street to Bldg. 20, the KA still ran, but had no memory, since its
latest memory incarnation was all modified LispM Mem boards, which were
given to needy Lispms when the Lab flushed the machine. i think the
Concourse hackers have since had access to more of these Mem boards, but
they have not (alas!) managed to bring the KA up in full-fledged fashion.

the other KAs, ML and DM, were flushed about a year and a half ago. their
hardware is probably down in the basement somewhere, but not likely in
reconstitutable shape.  MC, which i'm sure you're aware was the first KL
DEC shipped and got running, is close to its last legs hardwarily.

however, NONE OF THE ABOVE comprise sufficient reason to think ITS is
dying. we have begged 4 KS-10s (2020s) from DEC, and with a fair amount of
microcode and device-driver hacking have ported ITS to this new form of
PDP10-family machine.  one of them has succeeded to the name MIT-AI, and
was just after long labor put onto the Arpanet last night. another is in
the process of being brought up; with luck it will also sit on the Arpanet,
bear the name MIT-MC, and do a lot of mail work. the other two still
require power wiring, but that will happen. they will sit on the
ChaosNet/Internet. we have not completely decided their names yet.

there are too many people here who care about ITS for it to die.

And it came to pass that on the seventh day of February 1986, AI the
KS10, godchild of AI the KA10 and child of much sweat, fast talking,
and cussing, did come up upon the ARPANET as host 10.2.0.6.  And there
was much rejoicing and jumping up and down and comments of "Yow,
verily, we are winning".

And as we sat there, SUPDUPed in from various KL10s, running PEEK and
marveling at the "(TCP)" indicators in the A display, we did see a
small flurry of connections to the SMTP port.  And we were somewhat
bemused by this, since as far as the rest of the ARPANET could tell it
had been 3 years since MIT-AI had last been up.  And after a short
time the flurry died down, and the entire net breathed a (quiet) sigh
of relief that the two issues of SF-LOVERS and three Bandykin messages
that had been caught in transit back when the KA was turned off had
finally made it home to 10.2.0.6.

ARPANET.  When it absolutely, positively MUST get there, even if we
have to build a new CPU to deliver it to.

Re:   Death of MC

Given that MC and AI may die at any moment, it would be nice if a demo
of ITS could be run before MC goes away, and put on videotape.  A lot
of effort has gone into the ITS system, and some sort of record of it
would be satisfying.  And of course with the recent notoriety
(`Hackers') of ITS and Tech Square, the future audience might be more
than Tech Square people.

Something along the lines of a home movie is what I have in mind.

Maybe something about the system itself -- a `guided tour' showing all
the little hacks.  Ideally, the old hackers would be brought in and
talk about their favorite hacks -- Gosper, Beeler, Schroeppel, Knight,
Greenblatt, Jonl White, Stallman, ...

And then maybe something about research.  Of course, it would be hard
to get many of the systems running, but Macsyma certainly works.  It
is ... how shall we put it ... hardly likely that Shrdlu could be put
through its paces, but Microplanner and Conniver and so on have some
hope.

angered, and distressed at this violent and childish reaction to my original

As to your being deeply insulted by my message, I think I was rather gently
and humorously pointing out that there was something inappropriate in the way
you phrased your original message.  Four or five people on this list sent me
mail saying they appreciated the humor of my message, but that they saw
nothing in it to explain why you reacted the way you did.  If you feel

console yourself with the thought that you are probably the only person who

Not too believable, is it?  And that's how we should keep it.

    About COMSAT.  Unless something really bizarre has been done to
    it, there shouldn't be much trouble here.  The problems I see
    mentioned are all things that can be readily fixed by someone who
    has the time to concentrate on it for a week or so.  (I don't have
    it, but I and all the other past COMSAT hackers are of course
    available for questioning).  For example, the address space
    gronkage can be fixed by moving either or both of the system-map
    or hosts3-map area into an inferior and using a shared page for
    Q&A interaction.

That's sort of what I figured, although it will probably take me
longer since I'm not an ITS wizard (that's ok, that's how one becomes
an ITS wizard).  I don't think anything particularly weird has
happened, just the domain support needed and the address space crunch.
CSTACY actually has done most of the hard work, he just hasn't
*finished* it.  I suspect that just finishing his NETWRK clone
routines to talk to the resolver will be most of it, and the rest will
just be using a smaller host table with just the MIT authoritative
data (probably just Chaos+LCS+AI+RLE, no Athena stuff).  The inferior
job hack is a cute idea, which I will keep in mind if it proves
necessary.

Thanks for the comments, you may find a lot of silly questions from me
in your mailbox one of these days....

    5) We need a way to reliably back up the KS, which doesn't have
       a tape drive at the moment. We either need someone to write
       a fast network backup system, or an RH11 Massbus controller
       so we can dual-port AI's TU77 or something and use that.

I still plan to make remote-tape backup work.  I now plan to temporarily
abandon the remote-tape server for ITS and concentrate on the user end.
Remote-tape servers already exist for TOPS-20, Unix, and the 3600.  I did
some quick estimating and I don't think the slow Chaosnet support on the
KS will make a big difference to the speed compared to local tape, provided
the load on the machine is light.  We'll see.

Of course this is a spare-time project and I can't promise any results.

Curiousity aroused by the MC broadcast, I wandered over to check my mail and
patiently d'ed my way through the pile of ks-its stuff.  Here are a few
comments:

You should be able to get away with swapping the KS for the KL on the
IMP port without paperwork, considering that this is something on the order
of doing board-replacement maintenance.  The NIC would want to change the
processor type in its database, but that is about it.  Adding a new host
on a new port would definitely involve DCA paperwork.

There is not that much difference between a local-host and a
distant-host IMP interface.  BBN can change this easily enough,
although time and paperwork would be involved.  Note that you could
simply build your own little LH/DH converter box, which is basically a
lump of line drivers.  We have one here at SRI which was used to hook a LH
interface up with a DH IMP port.

As a matter of fact, we also have a perfectly healthy IMP-11A interface here
that no one wants (it belongs to an 11/40 that no one wants either).
This isn't very different from an ACC to my knowledge; I've written driver
code for a few of those things and it's pretty simple.  I'm not sure
why people seem to think the ACC is the only choice.  If you want this one,
I could check it out.

About COMSAT.  Unless something really bizarre has been done to it, there
shouldn't be much trouble here.  The problems I see mentioned are all things
that can be readily fixed by someone who has the time to concentrate on it
for a week or so.  (I don't have it, but I and all the other past COMSAT
hackers are of course available for questioning).  For example, the
address space gronkage can be fixed by moving either or both of the
system-map or hosts3-map area into an inferior and using a shared page
for Q&A interaction.

Finally, the TCP/IP code itself can be improved.  There are some simple
things that can be done which should improve throughput and reduce load.
I would not worry about the network traffic (although JNC is right that it
should be hooked into an IMP; a gateway would collapse).  I might
have time to fiddle with this, especially if a MX test machine will be
available for crash-testing.

Good luck; the plan sounds good to me.

Well, we seem to have arrived at a plan. This is based on the recent
KS-ITS explosion and a discussion with Karen Sollins, who has contributed
a strong commitment to maintaining the network-wide services that MC has
been providing, and a useful sense of practicality.

The Goal:

1) Privide a replacement for the MC-KL which will handle mailing lists,
   archiving, and so on in a reliable manner. 

2) Provide a way for the MC-KL to continue operation for a while after 
   it is officially decommissioned, without it being in anybody's
   critical path.

The Plan:

Basically what Bill Rozas suggested. We're going to try using a KS to
handle the mail. This machine will initially be called MIT-MX. It
will be connected directly to the ARPAnet, and eventually to MIT
ethernets as well. During the period from now to March 31 this
machine will be used to test things that must work if the machine
is to replace MC. If everything works OK, shortly after March 31
this machine will be renamed MC and connected to the ARPAnet at
MC's address. The KL will be renamed MX, and will continue to be
available until it isn't.

If by sometime in March it is clear that the KS isn't going to be
able to handle being MC, we will go to an alternate plan in which
the new MC will be a Unix of some kind. The current NAMES > from
MC will be automagically converted to sendmail format, and a way
will be provided for lists to be editted without having an account
on the machine. In this case the MC KL will still be renamed MX,
and will continue to run for a while. 

The Booby Traps:

The following things need to happen before we can do this.

1) We need an ACC LH/DH IMP interface, either for the KS or the
   vax, depending. People are looking into either buying this or
   getting ACC to help save MC.

2) We need a COMSAT repairperson. There is a volunteer.

3) We need some LH/DH code. Stay tuned.

4) We eventually need some ethernet code, both for this and the
   other two KS10s. A volunteer is urgently needed in this area.

5) We need a way to reliably back up the KS, which doesn't have
   a tape drive at the moment. We either need someone to write
   a fast network backup system, or an RH11 Massbus controller
   so we can dual-port AI's TU77 or something and use that. If
   you have an RH11 in your basement, please identify yourself
   to an usher. Thank you for your cooperation.

6) So what did I forget this time?

	Hey, I'm in favor, I just want people to watch the ground
instead of the stars (and trip over their own feet). I agree with you
that we should be talking about, and acting on, the practical tasks we
need to do (e.g. COMSAT, ARPA suuport, etc). Once we have the pieces
I can possibly work around the difficulties, but we need to have those
precursors. JTW and Karen are discussing things, so something may
happen.

	I think Karen Sollins is going to be sending a message about
this, explaining exactly what is going to happen and dispelling the
rumors, fairly shortly. She is going to attempt to get it to all the
corners of he known universe.
	Also, the names were chosen because of the movie 'Silent Running',
where they are the names of the three identical little droids. They
Walt Disney correlation is accidental (although I am a great fan of

    	I think I need to point out a few facts and probabilities here,
    guys, before you all go haring off and decide to glork the snazputt.
    This applies to all sorts of different camps, not just *you*.
    	A) MC uses a different brand of IMP port from ALL the other
    machines in the building; it uses what is called a 'Local Host'
    interface while all the rest are 'Distant Host'. This means that you
    can't plug any other machine into MC's port without some hardware
    work, which will involve making a new non-standard cable. Also,
    the LH port uses coax for wires (it's TTL) and won't run more than
    about 30 feet.
    	I don't want to go into all the details, but while it is
    possible to convert ports from one flavor to the other, it's not
    going to happen in this case. What this means is that you can forget
    plugging anything else into MC's port.

Well, you have told us why it is hard, but you haven't told us why you
assert "it's not going to happen".  I guess I can assume there is some
bureaucratic pinheadedness involved.  So OK, let us assume for the moment
that when MC turns into a pumpkin, its IMP port turns into a white mouse.

    	B) Switching around which machine is plugged in where (namewise)
    and getting the NIC to update the HOSTS.TXT file that a lot of places
    still use requires the intervention of DCA. They absolutely, under no
    circumstances whatsoever, will do this until the have the piece of
    paper from DCA telling them they can do it. Needless to say, the DCA
    is a semi-infinite delay line. Scratch all solutions that require
    renaming MC and giving the name MC to something else.

OK, so it can't be done -instantaneously-.  Suppose for a while some people
thought MC was at one address and some people thought it was at another.
If they are using it to deliver mail, and we get our act together, they
don't even have to lose.  How hard is it to get that piece of paper
through?  (No need to begin your answer by telling me a long story about
how fucked up they are, I already know that.  Seriously, I understand.  No,
I don't want you to tell me a saga in five part harmony, I just want to
know what we have to do, how long it will take, whose ass we have to kiss
along the way.)

I note, BTW, that you are excluding a whole class of solutions that don't
invole frobbing the host tables at all.  Ignoring the issue of local vs.
distant host interfaces for the moment, realize that we can swap where a
pair of cables go locally without anybodies permission and effectively swap
the hardware.  Are the DCA going to send the Turing police around to be
sure that that is -really- a KL-10 plugged into that port?  (Don't bother
composing a reply to this paragraph pointing out the bugs, I'm not making a
proposal here, I just want to add this particular device to the bag of
ideas knocking around that we are trying to bang into a solution.)

    	C) The labs are about to lose a large chunk of funding due to
    pending budget cuts; and I doubt there will be any money left over for
    buying any more LHDH-11's, (which are outrageously expensive). So,
    scsratch ideas that involve a new LHDH.

Well, since we suspect that the -old- LHDH (the one connected to AI) might
be fucked, there is a chance that this means scrap any idea involving any
KS ever being connected directly to Arpanetland.

    	D) The current traffic volume through MC is about 2.7
    Mpkt/week, and that through the MIT-GW is about 3.3 Mpkt/week. They
    are both in the Top 10; the only machines with traffic rates near
    their combined sum are the MILNET<->ARPANET gateways, which are
    croaking under the load. If you were to try to use a machine that was
    on the MIT local nets as an MC replacement, the packet volume would
    croak the MIT-GW. Scratch using any machine on the internal MIT nets.

And thus if the AI LHDH is fucked, scratch using an ITS for mail gateway
service.  Hello Unix.  Pass me the barf bag.

    	The conclusion that I reach from looking at these technical
    points is that the it would have to be a XX, a stripped MC, or AI
    (since I don't think OZ is ever going to make it onto the ARPANET). XX
    is too heavily loaded, and doesn't have a great TCP anyway. MC would
    be OK as long as it lasts but the CPU will probably fuse next big
    power glitch, and that will be that. AI is the best bet; people from
    the AI Lab actually wanting to use an ITS could use on of the other
    machines. 

More reasonable, assuming the AI LHDH works, would be to unplug it from AI
and plug it into one of the other new KS machines.  AI already has a small
user-community, and it is more important that the machine that the users
use has the tape drive directly connected to it.

	      COMSAT is also the best mailer, I think, but I could be
    wrong about that. (Does anyone who knows care to comment?)
    	The only bug in this scenario is that COMSAT is currently in a
    poor state of health. Some competent and reliable needs to become
    responsible for it before it is a serious contender. CSTACY is not
    a serious contender on the reliability front; someone who is expected
    to be around for a while would have to come forward. Unless this happens
    any hope of using an ITS for the job is idle chatter.

Well, I -thought- I heard SRA hint that -perhaps- he would -consider-
-possibly- thinking about this.  I'm quite willing to toss the whole thing
out the window and declare that ITS does not support any form of mail
service any more.

This morning my opinion is that the most important thing we could be doing
for ITS is working on Interlan support so that we can get all of these
machines on the Internet.  Notice that we don't seem to be talking about

	I think I need to point out a few facts and probabilities here,
guys, before you all go haring off and decide to glork the snazputt.
This applies to all sorts of different camps, not just *you*.


	A) MC uses a different brand of IMP port from ALL the other
machines in the building; it uses what is called a 'Local Host'
interface while all the rest are 'Distant Host'. This means that you
can't plug any other machine into MC's port without some hardware
work, which will involve making a new non-standard cable. Also,
the LH port uses coax for wires (it's TTL) and won't run more than
about 30 feet.
	I don't want to go into all the details, but while it is
possible to convert ports from one flavor to the other, it's not
going to happen in this case. What this means is that you can forget
plugging anything else into MC's port.

	B) Switching around which machine is plugged in where (namewise)
and getting the NIC to update the HOSTS.TXT file that a lot of places
still use requires the intervention of DCA. They absolutely, under no
circumstances whatsoever, will do this until the have the piece of
paper from DCA telling them they can do it. Needless to say, the DCA
is a semi-infinite delay line. Scratch all solutions that require
renaming MC and giving the name MC to something else.

	C) The labs are about to lose a large chunk of funding due to
pending budget cuts; and I doubt there will be any money left over for
buying any more LHDH-11's, (which are outrageously expensive). So,
scsratch ideas that involve a new LHDH.

	D) The current traffic volume through MC is about 2.7
Mpkt/week, and that through the MIT-GW is about 3.3 Mpkt/week. They
are both in the Top 10; the only machines with traffic rates near
their combined sum are the MILNET<->ARPANET gateways, which are
croaking under the load. If you were to try to use a machine that was
on the MIT local nets as an MC replacement, the packet volume would
croak the MIT-GW. Scratch using any machine on the internal MIT nets.


	The conclusion that I reach from looking at these technical
points is that the it would have to be a XX, a stripped MC, or AI
(since I don't think OZ is ever going to make it onto the ARPANET). XX
is too heavily loaded, and doesn't have a great TCP anyway. MC would
be OK as long as it lasts but the CPU will probably fuse next big
power glitch, and that will be that. AI is the best bet; people from
the AI Lab actually wanting to use an ITS could use on of the other
machines. COMSAT is also the best mailer, I think, but I could be
wrong about that. (Does anyone who knows care to comment?)
	The only bug in this scenario is that COMSAT is currently in a
poor state of health. Some competent and reliable needs to become
responsible for it before it is a serious contender. CSTACY is not
a serious contender on the reliability front; someone who is expected
to be around for a while would have to come forward. Unless this happens
any hope of using an ITS for the job is idle chatter.

    Well, the cat is out of the bag now about the retirement of the current
    incarnation of MC....
in a rather large way. rumors are flying pretty rampantly over most of the
large mailing lists, many of them badly informed. for instance, some
propound that OZ will have no other way of reaching the arpanet.

	     ...I will send a message to ARPANET-BBOARDS explaining that
    the hardware is dying but that we intend to continue to provide mail
    service (somehow) on a machine called MIT-MC, including the big mailing
    lists like ARPANET-BBOARDS.  
rob, you're the point man here. meaning you get to send the msg. and i

	To hell with them.  Why should we have any more consideration for

    I think that in fairness to the rest of the known universe we ought to
    either maintain some kind of decent service or announce that we are
    opting out of this game.  I am somewhat reluctant to do this (opt out)
    both for emotional reasons and because I don't want some cretin with a
    vax who hasn't even bothered to read the sendmail documentation taking
    on the job of ARPANET-BBOARDS....
btw, who -is- going to take over running ARPANET-BBOARDS from GSB?

	Can we push the Dover out the window?
    As soon as we are sure the other printers we have will work ok. 
a digressive side issue, dave. rob is right: nothing yet duplicates the
dover's speed, and the new printers, while well-adapted to the more popular
justifiers, do not yet allow me to print j random file with a font
specified. (yeah, they say i can do that from a Lispm, but i don't think i
should have to log into a lispm specifically to get this sort of service).
they don't even hack R, not to mention TJ6 (i would like TJ6, although i
realize it might be a little far-fetched to expect it). as Gumby later
mentioned, the dover -can- sort of run TJ6.

     4) Something I didn't think of.
    I don't know whether this is possible or hard, but I am nostalgic and
    would like to have MC around in a different incarnation.  Thus...

    I would suggest that we get an LH/DH and bring up the KS as
    MIT-DINOSUAR at whatever address the KL will eventually have....
    At some point in the future, once the KL has been debugged and is
    ready, swap the KL and KS...

            I would suggest...
    This actually strikes me as quite a reasonable plan as well.  (Possibly
    the people in LCS who are still -using- MC might be made a little
    uncomfortable if we start discouraging logins, etc. right away, but the
    discouragement could be pretty mild, like a couple of obnoxious lines
    of text added to the login greeting.)

    Instead of MIT-DINOSAUR, might I suggest the name MIT-MX?  Note that it
    has to be some name that is two letters long, or can easily be
    abbreviated to two letters, and "MX" seems like it might be a good
    hack....
frankly, i was under the impression that jinx's plan, with alan's name
scheme, was proposed to general agreement some months ago, i've forgotten
by whom. possibly i'm hallucinating. i thought those were ordinary button
mushrooms in the hot&sour tonight...

the local and other official users of the current MC can move to other
local machines: AI, XX, the other KSs as they come up, various vaxen, etc.
the non-lab tourists (all those macsyma users, random net hackers, high
school students from mountain view CA & vienna VA, ad nauseum) should be
treated differently. some of them are people we might be willing to grant
similar guest accounts on AI; many of them we want to flush (all those
macsyma users from the net!). we need to set up a clearinghouse for rumor
control and account review, and soon.  perhaps USER-A@MC should do this;
Alan has suggested that instead, a special-purpose list be set up. the name
of this list (yes, i volunteer to be on it) should be in the broadcast msg
about MC's state.

    (We still need to decide what to call the other two of the three KS's.
    There is a strong faction that wants the three to have the names HUEY,
    DEWEY and LOUIE.  There are machines with these names at UDEL, but
    -theoretically- that isn't a problem in the domain-style future.  I
    really want one of them to be ML.  Unfortunately the name DM went to

    MX sounds kind of cute.  The people currently owning the name DM are
    LCS HQ people, who probably don't care except that it will confused
    them if we try to take it away.  I am the right person to talk to them
    about this, I guess.  No, we can't have DM.AI.MIT.EDU because of this
    agreement that we won't have any name conflicts among the MIT
    community, or at least not between the parts that cooperate with each
    other (AI and LCS and RLE and maybe EECS).

    I don't particularlly like the duck names, would rather get back the old
    ITS names if we can.
i don't like the duck names either. given the state of domains on the net,
i do not trust -theoretical- non-problems like this. i gather we can snarf
the name ML immediately? rob, could you ask LCS HQ to change their name
(surely they would prefer something more officious)? if they won't, maybe
we should use MD (note reference to MedGroup, which is an active LCS
research group that uses MC).

one issue not yet mentioned: all those 7track ITS dump tapes. once MC goes,
-nothing- we have can read them until we get a surplus 7track drive
somewhere, and somehow hook it up to a current machine. this has been
discussed orally and various methods for the acquisition and the attachment
proposed. the old ITS tapes should of course not be trashed, considering
the valuable bits they contain, but there will be a period, possibly of a
couple years, during which those bits will not be accessible. in the
meantime, MC users must be urged to move their files elsewhere -including-
all the reaped files that they used to have and still want. i suppose i
should add myself to FILE-R@MC too.

    	Can we push the Dover out the window?

        This is not the list to discuss this on, but there are several
        programs which depend on the dover.  How do I get my TJ6 output
        without it?

    As far as I know the only printer actually supported by TJ6 is the XGP.

The dover has this crufy "XGP-emulation mode" though.

More to the point, the dover is the only "high quality" (when the moon
is full) and high-volume printer we have.  Printing 150-page listings
on a laserwriter or qms is not only time-consuming and antisocial, but
doesn't give the tiny printer time to rest.

    Are the KS10 cabinet and the LH/DH cabinet firmly grounded to each

That's a thought; they're not.

I'm inclined to write this off to cosmic rays, and worry about it if it
ever happens again after the hardware configuration of that unibus
settles down.

	ICHECK, DUMP got an error; it mentioned RH11 err and maybe MAG TAPE
	IN DEV. HUNG or something -- see sys log for details. the second time
	i tried ICHECK, it worked.

    The immediate cause of the crash was here in the interrupt level Chaos net
    code:

    CHSRC5:	IORDI B,CAIRBF		;Read out the data, halfwords
	    IORDI C,CAIRBF

    The second read from CAIRBF got a Non-Existent I/O Register error; just
    like someone had suddenly unplugged the Chaos board.  

I have a vague memory that Chaos boards do this sometimes.  I hope I'm wrong.
Alan and I discussed kludges for making the software resilient to this, but
I hope we don't have to resort to them.  It would be in the grand tradition
of the previous two MIT-AI machines, though.

							  If there were system
    messages from the magtape code indicating that it was unhappy as well, then
    perhaps we can conclude that the fault happened somewhere in the "I" Unibus
    itself.  (It would be nice if :SYSMSG worked on a crash dump!)

I used to have a program to do this, I think.  Better would be to stick SYSMSG
inside PEEK and then take advantage of PEEK's existing crash-dump-analysis feature.

    Perhaps someone who knows more Unibusology than I do can offer an opinion
    about what might cause this?  Remember that this is the Unibus that
    supports the magtape drive, the DZ11's and the Chaosnet interface.  The
    magtape code was shooting bits back and forth like crazy at the time,
    presumably that contributed somehow?

    JTW:  Is the LH/DH plugged into this bus right now?  Perhaps it did
    something nasty?

JTW: Can you look at the crash dump and figure out whether the magtape RH-11
was supposed to be doing DMA at the time this crash happened?  Maybe it and
the Chaos board interfere with each other somehow?

Does anyone know how long the NXM timeout on a KS10 unibus is?  The Chaos
board can be slower to respond (3 or 4 microseconds?) when you read it twice
in a row, as I recall.

Are the KS10 cabinet and the LH/DH cabinet firmly grounded to each other?  If not,
connecting a Unibus cable between them might cause electrical problems.

        I would suggest that we get an LH/DH and bring up the KS as
        MIT-DINOSUAR at whatever address the KL will eventually have.  As soon
        as possible (now) start discouraging logins, etc. on MC (KL) and
        advertise that all service execept mail will disappear in the near
        future.

        At some point in the future, once the KL has been debugged and is
        ready, swap the KL and KS and eliminate logins or whatever.

    Having thought about it more, my opinion is now that this is the best
    plan.  For some reason I don't like the name Dinosaur; that might
    be simple prejudice, because we at Symbolics reserve that name for
    machines with IBM 360 (and descendents) architecture.

This actually strikes me as quite a reasonable plan as well.  (Possibly the
people in LCS who are still -using- MC might be made a little uncomfortable
if we start discouraging logins, etc. right away, but the discouragement
could be pretty mild, like a couple of obnoxious lines of text added to the
login greeting.)

Instead of MIT-DINOSAUR, might I suggest the name MIT-MX?  Note that it has
to be some name that is two letters long, or can easily be abbreviated to
two letters, and "MX" seems like it might be a good hack.  Before the
exchange of names we can explain that the "X" stands for "Experimental" and
afterwards it could stand for "Ex-MC".

(We still need to decide what to call the other two of the three KS's.
There is a strong faction that wants the three to have the names HUEY,
DEWEY and LOUIE.  There are machines with these names at UDEL, but
-theoretically- that isn't a problem in the domain-style future.  I really
want one of them to be ML.  Unfortunately the name DM went to some LCS
Vax.)

    I would suggest that we get an LH/DH and bring up the KS as
    MIT-DINOSUAR at whatever address the KL will eventually have.  As soon
    as possible (now) start discouraging logins, etc. on MC (KL) and
    advertise that all service execept mail will disappear in the near
    future.

    At some point in the future, once the KL has been debugged and is
    ready, swap the KL and KS and eliminate logins or whatever.

Having thought about it more, my opinion is now that this is the best
plan.  For some reason I don't like the name Dinosaur; that might
be simple prejudice, because we at Symbolics reserve that name for
machines with IBM 360 (and descendents) architecture.

    dumped to CRASH;PI-IN PROGRS, which is what the PI lev. 6 bughalt
    complained about. see log for numbers. it was checking the incr. dump
    when this happened. after AI came up, the first time i tried to run
    ICHECK, DUMP got an error; it mentioned RH11 err and maybe MAG TAPE
    IN DEV. HUNG or something -- see sys log for details. the second time
    i tried ICHECK, it worked.

The immediate cause of the crash was here in the interrupt level Chaos net
code:

CHSRC5:	IORDI B,CAIRBF		;Read out the data, halfwords
	IORDI C,CAIRBF

The second read from CAIRBF got a Non-Existent I/O Register error; just
like someone had suddenly unplugged the Chaos board.  If there were system
messages from the magtape code indicating that it was unhappy as well, then
perhaps we can conclude that the fault happened somewhere in the "I" Unibus
itself.  (It would be nice if :SYSMSG worked on a crash dump!)

Perhaps someone who knows more Unibusology than I do can offer an opinion
about what might cause this?  Remember that this is the Unibus that
supports the magtape drive, the DZ11's and the Chaosnet interface.  The
magtape code was shooting bits back and forth like crazy at the time,
presumably that contributed somehow?

JTW:  Is the LH/DH plugged into this bus right now?  Perhaps it did
something nasty?

    Date: Monday, 20 January 1986  20:04-EST
    From: David A. Moon <Moon@SCRC-STONY-BROOK.ARPA>

    To hell with them.  Why should we have any more consideration for
    people's old habits than the people who imposed domains on the
    world?

I think that in fairness to the rest of the known universe we ought to
either maintain some kind of decent service or announce that we are
opting out of this game.  I am somewhat reluctant to do this (opt out)
both for emotional reasons and because I don't want some cretin with a
vax who hasn't even bothered to read the sendmail documentation taking
on the job of ARPANET-BBOARDS.  Some depths I am not willing to sink
to....

    I'm inclined towards #3 but I don't feel strongly and I'm not sure
    I rate a vote. 

Sure you get a vote.  This whole thing is being done by selfless
hackers for the Good of All (oh, you didn't know that sending mail to
KS-ITS put you on the DoGooder's mailing list for all time?).

    Note that if the KL hardware remains named MC and remains attached to
    44/3, but becomes an unreliable machine for private hacks, you can
    always turn off its mail server, or install one that rejects mail with a
    message somewhat more explanatory than "No children yet."  That will
    certainly stop anybody who is still sending mail to it.

Not a reasonable answer if you buy my fairness argument as above.
This is the major reason I want to make the KS-MC the 10.3.0.44
address.  We might as well get this all over with now if we can (ie, I
don't want to have to turn the world upside down again next year when
MC's CPU goes to the land where KL10-As are eternally blessed).

    Anything would be better than sendmail, even nothing at all!

Just mentioning that it was a solved problem.  Never let it be said
that this list is content with the easy sollution.  I do agree however
that sendmail is just above dogsled as a mail delivery mechanism and
should be avoided if possible.

    The machine where you put files that you want anyone in the world
    to be able to read without a password might as well be the same as
    the mail machine; it's not a heavy load, and this removes the need
    to tell the world about more than one of your machines.

Good point.  I like it.  Although if all you care about is *reading*
files, you can do that from XX too (none of this "anonymous login
restrictions apply nonsense").  But an ITS is more useful since there
are things that we want to be global write access too.

    Symbolics' mailer works quite well except for not having a domain
    resolver yet.  It's been the only mailer we trust in-house for a
    couple of years now.

Ok, fine.  I'm still not going to touch it, but other people are
welcome to do so.  XX's MMAILR does have a resolver hookup, which
works (most of the time and unless it decides to crash the machine
instead).  I'm not really wildly enthused about XX taking the load,
but it's available if we need it.

    Can we push the Dover out the window?

As soon as we are sure the other printers we have will work ok.  But
the old Doverspooler network protocol is probably bound for the dust
heap anyway.  JTW and I have been talking about implementing a 4.2bsd
style LPD listener for ITS, since that seems to be the emerging
standard for network print spooling (not a bad one either, barring
some idiocies that we don't have to implement).  But in any case it's
a minor issue.

Same thing as Gail said goes for all other MIT software (like the
Dover spooler).  Nobody said this would be easy, the question is just
how to keep from having to update things (and people's minds) all over
the whole Internet.  Thanks for bringing it up, but it is relatively
unimportant in the global scheme of things.

    From: John Wroclawski <JTW%MIT-SPEECH@MIT-MC.ARPA>

    Although I like the idea, giving the MC name to a KS has a couple of
    problems. 

     1) I imagine there are a lot of people that have MC == IMP 44, HOST 3
	wired into their tiny little minds, and moving its IP address
	is going to be a pain.

To hell with them.  Why should we have any more consideration for people's
old habits than the people who imposed domains on the world?

     2) There is general agreement that a KS devoted to mail will be pretty
	busy, so we have to find some polite way of discouraging other
	types of heavy non-MIT use from people who are used to MC being there.

I agree.

    Naming the machine MIT-PO (post office) or something might help
    solve these problems. It would also give us a chance to get this
    working before MC totally dies. Balanced against that is that it
    would create an awful lot of confusion. 

    If we are going to name a KS MC, I think we should acquire another
    LHDH IMP interface and put it on the Arpanet at 3/44. Then we should
    make up something to tell people who have been using it for other
    things.

    Also (Oh boy I hate to bring this up) there is the question of what
    exactly is going to be done with the KL hardware when. Based on past
    history and the desires of many people I pretty much expect to see a
    somewhat shrunken MC-KL running for some time after it is un-DECified,
    until the processor fuses itself into a glob some day. We can't have
    two MCs, and I don't think I want to count on an unmaintained KL
    for mail service, even if we do trash the T300s and the Ampex.

I agree with both parts of the preceding paragraph.

    JTW's unscientific opinion pole. Please vote.

     1) Name the KS MC, rename the KL MIT-DINOSAUR, get an LH/DH, and
	pertend nothing happened.

     2) As above, but forget the LH/DH. (leaving floating for the moment
	the question of how, exactly, the KS is supposed to speak IP).

     3) Name the KS MIT-PO (Oh, all right, PO.LCS.MIT.EDU, or maybe even
	PO.MIT.EDU), and move all the mailing lists. Keep the KL as
	MC till it dies. We still could use an LH/DH.

     4) Something I didn't think of.

I'm inclined towards #3 but I don't feel strongly and I'm not sure I rate a vote.

Note that if the KL hardware remains named MC and remains attached to
44/3, but becomes an unreliable machine for private hacks, you can
always turn off its mail server, or install one that rejects mail with a
message somewhat more explanatory than "No children yet."  That will
certainly stop anybody who is still sending mail to it.

    Finally, I'm not sure 4.2 sendmail is a reasonable fallback position
    unless someone is going to really work on it. There are just too many
    things it does badly or not at all. Either MMAILR/Twenex or the
    Symbolics mailer might be a better choice.

Anything would be better than sendmail, even nothing at all!

    Well, my zero-real-data guess is that the vast majority of the
    references to "MIT-MC" around the world are mailing list stuff.  While
    I there are other things and they will be a pain, this can be solved
    on a practical level by running PWORD, not having user accounts on the
    KS-MC except for wizards, and leaving up a sysmsg telling people that
    they really want to telnet to MIT-DINOSAUR.  Maybe something more
    polite/elegant can be worked out (like that will also cover FTP) but
    this will be enough to get by.

The machine where you put files that you want anyone in the world to be
able to read without a password might as well be the same as the mail machine;
it's not a heavy load, and this removes the need to tell the world about
more than one of your machines.

    I think that the most reasonable thing to do for net connection is to
    put an LH/DH on 10.3.0.44 and the hell with the users if they can't
    take a joke.  Of course this presumes that the device driver will be
    finished.

    I think this comes out as a vote for option (1).

    As for mailers.  The sendmail stuff is already done (against my wimpy
    objections, which were wimpy indeed because at that point I wasn't
    even considering taking over maintainance of COMAST).  I agree that
    sendmail is a real loser (this is a technical opinion which I will
    back up to anybody who is offended by it).  I would volunteer XX's
    MMAILR as an interim sollution except for the IP address problem, and
    I am obviously not going to change XX's IP address.  Symbolics mailer
    I don't know from and don't really have time to learn at this point.
    If somebody else wants to watch over it, fine, but I am not going to
    touch it.

Symbolics' mailer works quite well except for not having a domain resolver yet.
It's been the only mailer we trust in-house for a couple of years now.

    Seems to me that there are other things that depend on either MC's

I assume OZ will be switched to use AI as a gateway the day AI has Internet
support installed.

In any case, anything inside MIT is thousands of times easier to change than
references to MIT-MC outside MIT, so it shouldn't be much of a concern.

In-Reply-To: Message from "Rob Austein <SRA@XX.LCS.MIT.EDU>" of Mon 20 Jan 86 17:24:01-EST


Although I like the idea, giving the MC name to a KS has a couple of
problems. 

 1) I imagine there are a lot of people that have MC == IMP 44, HOST 3
    wired into their tiny little minds, and moving its IP address
    is going to be a pain.

 2) There is general agreement that a KS devoted to mail will be pretty
    busy, so we have to find some polite way of discouraging other
    types of heavy non-MIT use from people who are used to MC being there.

Naming the machine MIT-PO (post office) or something might help
solve these problems. It would also give us a chance to get this
working before MC totally dies. Balanced against that is that it
would create an awful lot of confusion. 

If we are going to name a KS MC, I think we should acquire another
LHDH IMP interface and put it on the Arpanet at 3/44. Then we should
make up something to tell people who have been using it for other
things.

Also (Oh boy I hate to bring this up) there is the question of what
exactly is going to be done with the KL hardware when. Based on past
history and the desires of many people I pretty much expect to see a
somewhat shrunken MC-KL running for some time after it is un-DECified,
until the processor fuses itself into a glob some day. We can't have
two MCs, and I don't think I want to count on an unmaintained KL
for mail service, even if we do trash the T300s and the Ampex.

JTW's unscientific opinion pole. Please vote.

 1) Name the KS MC, rename the KL MIT-DINOSAUR, get an LH/DH, and
    pertend nothing happened.

 2) As above, but forget the LH/DH. (leaving floating for the moment
    the question of how, exactly, the KS is supposed to speak IP).

 3) Name the KS MIT-PO (Oh, all right, PO.LCS.MIT.EDU, or maybe even
    PO.MIT.EDU), and move all the mailing lists. Keep the KL as
    MC till it dies. We still could use an LH/DH.

 4) Something I didn't think of.

Finally, I'm not sure 4.2 sendmail is a reasonable fallback position
unless someone is going to really work on it. There are just too many
things it does badly or not at all. Either MMAILR/Twenex or the
Symbolics mailer might be a better choice.

Well, the cat is out of the bag now about the retirement of the
current incarnation of MC.  Unless somebody else wants to do it or
thinks it is a bad idea, I will send a message to ARPANET-BBOARDS
explaining that the hardware is dying but that we intend to continue
to provide mail service (somehow) on a machine called MIT-MC,
including the big mailing lists like ARPANET-BBOARDS.  In case people
haven't heard, we (LCS Computational Resources Group) have cobbled
together a setup that will allow us to do this with a 4.2 unix if this
is absolutely necessary.  For many reasons, some technical and some
religious, it is obviously preferable to continue to use an ITS for
this stuff, but doing it with a 4.2 sendmail is better than not at
all.

If I don't hear any serious objections from anybody in the next day or
two I'll send off a message.

    Well, I've been talking about how nice it would be to have a KS-ITS as
    a single user machine (which is probably all the users it could
    support if there's also a loaded COMSAT anyway, yes?).  If I had such
    a beastie I would want to have a working mailer.

(Not quite.  COMSAT spends a lot of time twiddling its thumbs waiting
for replies from network-land.  COMSAT running on a KA-10 wasn't as much
worse as COMSAT running on a KL-10 as you might think if you compared
raw processor power.  There will be some crunch left over, but yeah, not
all -that- much...)

Given that we will have to tell the world that -some- machine is a
replacement mailing address for MIT-MC, and given that if we move the name
MC somewhere it should probably be that same machine, and given that
everybody thinks it is reasonable to designate one of the 3 new machines as
a "Mail Machine", then I have no objection to putting SRA in charge of its
operations...

There is a problem, of course, in that we currently have no -immediate-
prospects of putting any KS-10 other than AI onto the Internet.  That
problem could be overcome by getting another LH/DH and finishing the driver
for that, or starting and finishing an Interlan driver.

    Make me an offer....

    Due to the installation of a new mail system, I can no longer ship off
    TELECOM to MC. Since there are quite a large number of MC users on
    TELECOM, and considering the fact that this restriction might affect
    other digests, I am sending this message to your bulletin board rather
    than individually to MC users.

I -believe- what he is refering to is the fact that digests tend to be
large enough that they exceed COMSAT's pitifully small size limitation.

I note that CSTACY claimed the lock for hacking COMSAT two weeks ago,
hacked on it for an evening, and hasn't logged in since then.

There are now about 130 BADREQ files on .MAIL2, many of them 2 weeks old.
(I'm going to have to create .MAIL3 soon...)

Warning:  If the day ever comes that I feel that it is Up-To-Me-
To-Do-Something about COMSAT (because of address space problems, lack of
proper domain support, or whatever) I will simply advise everybody that ITS
no longer supports mail for users or mail forwarding for the network and I
will shut it off.

I feel this day -rapidly- approaching.  I don't see any competent
programmers making the kind of necessary effort it is going to take to
straighten out this mess.  I am forwarding this message to a large audience
in the hopes that somebody will get inspired, but I realize this is
grasping at straws.

As part of the gradual move from MC to AI as the canonical home for all ITS

to the KSHACK directory on AI.  In the future all edits etc. should be done
on AI.  Duplicate copies remain on MC, but from now on they should be
treated as just that: duplicates.  Sources for ITS itself and the contents
of the MC SYSENG directories will follow during the next few days.  (Alas,
this does mean that the day has arrived when we will have to start getting
used to using MIDAS on a slower KS10...)

	For those of you that haven't heard, it's official: there
are three of the critters on a loading dock at DEC with 'MIT'
stamped on them. We are making arrangements to have them picked
up. An unofficial list of what is on them is: 512K mem (although
it might be 384K), 1 RP06 and 16 lines of DZ. Not great, but not
terrible.
	Thanks are due to Dave Clark for blowing brownie points
and writing a letter, our DEC salesman, Arnie Cohen, for launching
this inside DEC, and especially Connie Davis in Large Systems
Marketing at DEC, who bailed this thing out when it got stuck.
	I propose that we think up some offical gesture of thanks for
these individuals; my idea was a suitably bogus looking scroll signed
by collected ITS fanciers, along with a dinner or something. Any
other ideas?

Hardware is not the only problem with AI dialups.  AI does not

and does not do autobauding.  I hope to have the code written
relatively soon, so it is probably a good idea to start looking for

True story:  I was doing a Tags Search through the entire ITS sources
looking for something.  As my Emacs sucked in file after file and searched
through them I had a moment to pause and reflect about the impending demise
of MC.  "Gee whiz," I thought to myself, "we sure are going to miss the
amazing speed of the KL processor when MC goes away.  Lord knows how long a
big multi-file tags operation like this would take if I was using AI."
Imagine my suprise when I discovered that I -was- using AI!  (I was
supduping from MC and forgot which Emacs I was using.)  Granted I was all
alone at the time, and the operation is probably I/O-bound anyway.

there's something i don't know about how to deal with ITS full dumps.  the
dump log (in the wall file) appears to start a new full page for each tape,
and add subsidiary pages as needed; e.g., if tape 2570 is the third tape
listed in that wall file, and needs 5 pages off the dover to list all the
files it contains, these pages are numbered 3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4.  so
far, so good. however, you seem to have some way of breaking up enormous
wall files (caused by doing large chunks of the full dump in a single day)
into files that contain only about 5 tapes' worth of information. how do
you do this -- do you run some teco command over the large files? when i
did the last full dump of the old AI machine, i did it all in one day (a
very long day) and the wall file was absolutely enormous; alan had to
figure out a kludge to help me break it into chunks small enough for the
dover to print.

also, it looks like JTW will have the tape code up on the new AI machine
kind of soon, so i will start dumping it kind of soon. i may have forgotten
some of this stuff -- do you perchance have a file somewhere of
instructions and hints on how to dump an ITS, that i could refresh my
memory with? thx.

Twenex v4.2 wold run on the KS10 cpu.

Do'nt be afraid that we will steal your (by dec promised) processors
someone vispered that DEC has abt 50 of them somewhere.

I actually only wanted to get one cpu, 3 was mentioned as a
number big enough to have a system running for ever.

well, peter lothberg went out to DEC on wed. and sweet-talked them out
of 3 KSs. lucky STACKEN -- i wish we could get machines that easily.

which brought JNC to a horrible thought tonight, when i mentioned this had
happened. noel is of the opinion that DEC physically trashed most of the
KSs it used to have. suppose, he said, that peter's high mucky-muck friend
gave him -our- promised KSs? that would be pretty awful....

    Anybody think we want any of this junk?


    TME11-BA:
      TE10W 45IPS 7-track tape, TMB11 controller, cabinet	$2495

    TMB11:							$250 new, $175 used
      Random tape controller which can run a TU10W/TE10W/
      whatever other old 7-track clunker we can find in
      the basement.

I'd like to have a way to read MC backup tapes without having to send
them to Sweden to be copied onto 9-track tape.  Do you think somebody might
spring for the $3000?  It seems worth it (of course a 7-track tape drive
that is software compatible with the existing 9-track drive would be better.)

    RP06-AA:
      disk.							$895

    RM03-AA:
      disk, which is rumoured to contain a massbus SMD	$695
      controller so we could throw out the drive and hook
      up some kind of large CDC winchester or a bunch
      of fuji 160Mb's or something and win.

No comment.

Wonderful ! I do hope that our favorite Chinese food joint here is back up by then
(down for Kitchen work I think) but in any case I am sure that there are a 
number of people who would love to meet him here ! I may even have some 
parts that he needs for one of his systems I think. 

If he is there and there is anything that he needs in the way of parts for 
one of his KA10 systems, please have him send me mail warning me so that 
I can find it (not an easy task always) before he comes down here. Also,
if he really is interested in coming down here, he should tell me when 
and where to meet him, and if there are any arrangements that I can help
him with.....

This fellow will be arriving in Boston tonight (Saturday), and will
probably be around the Lab tonight for a couple of hours.  (His flight gets
to Logan at 9:41 pm.)  When we talked to him on the phone we didn't find
out how long he will be in this area, but I would guess that he certainly
will be around Sunday.

    At DECUS europe i met some DEC oficials who asked if we was interested
    in a KS machine, as i understand they have a bunch somewhere.
    Whats the state of the KS-ITS project ?

If I were you I would take it.  The status is that our first KS has been
running for months now and seems completely solid.  We aren't exactly
"done", since we have been lazy about getting around to supporting the tape
drive so that we can do backups, but we anticipate that will be finished
real soon now (right John?).  

There are some other things that we are working on that may or may not be
relevant to whatever KS configuration you might get from DEC.  Oh yeah, I
still haven't done a couple of the microcode changes I promised, like
support for 1-proceed and the JPC.

There are apparently 3 more KS's coming to MIT sometime soon for us to play
with, or so I have been led to believe.

Making you something that you could use to boot up a running ITS on a KS
would be totally easy.  (Well, pretty easy.  Like if you get RM03's rather
than RP06's it might take an extra edit or two, but nothing major.)

[ You know, the other day I was looking at some code in ITS that -knows- that
  no ITS machine could possibly be anywhere other than in the EDT/EST
  time-zone.  I suppose if you get an ITS to run we will probably have to
  deal with that somehow... ]

Yow ! Stardust is big, huh? OK. I know where I can get a box that
looks like an MH but has 4megwords in it, but they seem to want about $100K
for it. Too much for me. 

I know where there are 2 KS10 systems available for $6K each. Each system
has the following:

KS10 CPU
256KW MOS MEMORY
DZ11A 8 LINE EIA
2) RH11 MASSBUSS CONTROLLERS (one disk and one tape)


I know its not as good a deal as DEC donating some to the cause, but if
people are interested, contact me. I'd buy one my self, but I haven't the
spare change....

    If the price is reasonable, I would be interested in a copy of the 
    prints and any notes that might be available on implimenting the
    ITS paging system for my KA10. Also of great interest would be the
    stardust memory prints and such so that I could get rid of my old
    klunky MF10 core memory boxes. 

If you thought the MF10 was clunky...wait until you see the Stardust.
I really don't think you would want to try to build one.

Wow, that was a lot  of money, better be in the xerox business..
We have to think it ower, our intention is to have an 1985 design
of a pager, housed in the cpu. But it wold have been nice to
have the ML pager prints as a reference. Will come back with
a definite answer as soon as possible.

At DECUS europe i met some DEC oficials who asked if we was interested
in a KS machine, as i understand they have a bunch somewhere.

If the price is reasonable, I would be interested in a copy of the 
prints and any notes that might be available on implimenting the
ITS paging system for my KA10. Also of great interest would be the
stardust memory prints and such so that I could get rid of my old
klunky MF10 core memory boxes. 

Thanks

That sounds completely crazy.  You don't have 640 originals.
Run the prints through the ozalid machine we have or pay to have
Stones do it.  Last I knew, the price was .50 a sheet.

    It looks like the cheapest place to have your set of drawings copied is
    EAGLE Graphics, 1 Broadway, Cambridge.  They have a xerox machine that
    can take 17 X 22 size originals. (They will probably have to do the
    large drawing in two pieces) The estimated cost is $320.00 and they
    will take a purchase order.
    Let me know if you want me to take care of this.

i must admit, $320 is a hunk of money. Swedish hackers, do you want these
prints? if so, can you cough up all or part of this price?  local hackers,
if our friends in sweden would like these but can't put together that much
money, are we willing to take up a collection to help fund this enterprise?
STACKEN again, if you think the price for the whole collection is excessive
but need copies of some of the prints, please let us know, so we can
attempt to work out which ones you want.

    People from UPMAIL (Uppsala Univerity AI lab) who have a 2060
    (kl10d/e) and 2 (or 3) LMI Lisp machines on Chaosnet asked me
    for a copy of the code, are there enough files on the tapes we
    received ?What file goes into the PDP11 and microcode?

I think we left out most of the KL10 stuff to decrease the number of
tapes.  In any case, if they have a KL10 Model B (all machines sold
in the last N years are Model B's, and I don't think current releases
of Tops-20 run on Model A's), they would not be able to run ITS without
doing substantial microcode work.  MIT-MC is a Model A.  That model
has different microcode.

    Status report from Sweden,
    The 7 trac TU10 is now working on the T10 KI system, we have read the

    contains some hard read errors, but it can be misaligment of our tape
    drive.
if it turns out to be hopeless, let us know. one tape won't be a real hassle
to redo.

    We have decided to make a new paging hardware design, it will probably
    be less work th trying to find all needed old flip-chips.
a couple weeks ago, moon went over the old faded ML pager prints to darken
the pencilled in bits. i should investigate getting these copied so we can
ship you a set, at least for comparison.

    ....Have our letter arrived ?
while i was on vacation last week, an MIT internal mail envelope arrived
containing a letter to me and PHW, a couple of pamphlets in swedish, a
check, a picture of a KA or something very like one... i'm not sure if PHW
(Pat Winston) actually saw this packet, as it only has a date stamp from
his secretary, but i was pretty impressed. what kind of terminal is on the
table in the picture?  i plan to wave the things in swedish in my father's

Not being closely associated with the MIT folks that have brought ITS up
on the ks processor, I had not heard that there was an effort to get DEC
to give the group more ks machines (I suppose that it should have been
assumes that this would happen !). It would be a good thing. If DEC has
unsold ks systems around that they are going to scrap, and someone has some
problem with donating them, then how about someone who might be interested 
in buying one, but for a lower price than the normal commercial one ?
I have a KA10 system down here that I run occaisionaly as a hobby, and I
will upgrade to a KI as soon as I can figure out how to transport it to
my apartment where all this madness takes place. I would MUCH rather get
a KS10 based ITS running here, and then stick some dialups on it and make 
it available to the rather large Washington DC hacking community. There are
a lot of ITS folks down here, and a local ITS would be a good thing.

Who in DEC would I talk with to purchase 1 (only one ! I'm not interested in
any more than that !) of the KS processors ? If this would get in the way
of the donation process, forget I mentioned it. If it will save one more
potential ITS system from getting scrapped for the gold, then count me in.

	I'm sending out this note at the request to Alan to let you
all know the status of things on this front.
	For those of you who haven't heard, I have organised a
campaign to get DEC to give MIT several more of the little critters. A
letter was written asking for a donation of several of the machines to
MIT (i.e.  both LCS and AI); due to the time pressures involved (all
of the remaining unsold KS's were about to be scrapped) I couldn't get
a lot of big wheels to sign, but Dave Clark did agree to sign the
letter and lend his name to the campaign.
	DEC did set aside and earmark several of the machines; more
recently there has been activity inside DEC to justify giving the
machines to MIT. The DEC salesman for MIT, Arnie Cohen (who has been a
big help in all this) reported recently that things were looking very
positive, although not yet definite; I'll let you know more as I hear
it.
	If this comes through as I hope it will, it should mean the
continued existence of working examples of ITS for a good while to
come. Thanks are due to Arnie, Dave, and everyone who helped.

    Gerry Brown contacted Charles about the package you want shipped to
    Sweden.  The air freight charge will be $89.47; the boat charge is
    something under $15.00, but it takes 6 weeks.  Charles needs to know
    what you are sending.  If it's business we can send it asap for you; if
    it's personal you may wish to reconsider the method of shipment to
    reduce your cost.  I'm sorry that the AIL cannot assume the cost for a
    personal shipment.  Please let me know how to proceed.  Many thanks.

It certainly isn't personal.  The package contains a basic ITS kit; some
people at Stockholm University decided that ITS would be the best system to
run on some PDP-10s they have acquired, and we are the only place they can
get it.  They may be able to reimburse us for the tapes and the postage; I
included instructions for how to do this.  I would appreciate its being
sent by air freight; they have had to wait for some time while we figured
out exactly which files to send them and rooted around for various obscure
but necessary pieces of documentation.  If there are any further problems
with this, please let me know.

    I have started the work on planing howto actualy change the KA hardware,
    i want to have the posibility to run as much of the DEC diagnostics as
    possible. So some type of switch-selectable aproach is prefered, but it
    is no simple.

    In a month or so we shall try to have the two KI-10 Cpu:s running
    SMP with T10 7.02. We plan to use this system to assemble the ITS code.


    (       Are you sure you can deal with that volume of mail?  I don't think

    )

    Pls try to add:  ITS_bugs%QZCOM.MAILNET@MIT-MULTICS.ARPA
    in both ITS bugs and ITS on ks20.

I have done so.

    Will report as soon there is any sucsess.

We eagerly await your report.  The box of tapes, processor prints, and
documentation is sitting right next to me, thanks to a lot of work by

sorry for the extensive and continual delays. after some negotiation we
came up with a set of directories that you really need for ITS, and i
dumped them to tape. as soon as Moon writes or otherwise digs up a halfpage
document on the ITS tape format, and i gather some other hardcopy doc, we
will send you the box. this should happen by next week sometime.  is the
address you mentioned a while back (QZ, Stockholm U. Comp. Center) still
correct?

you may need a second care package later, but these should get you started.
if you have questions, ask.

Well, here is how I see things.  If somebody else had the spare enthusiasm
to figure out how to arrange things physically and financially for more of
these toys to walk in the door, I wouldn't object.  But the enthusiasm has
to come from someone else.  There is no point in having more of them if the
energy has to come out of me.  I'm spread thin enough as it is.  I confess
that I find the picture of a corral of happy little 2020's all running ITS
somewhat heart-warming, but I fear it just isn't to be.  Unless someone
-else- has a bright idea.

DEC has decided to scrap all of their remaining KS10's by the end of
this month.

After that, it will be damn near impossible for us to get another one in
any reasonable way.

The current situation is that we can probably get reasonable machines
(new condition, OK configuration) for about $10K per machine. It does
not look like we can get another free one. Getting them for $10K is
going to take a little effort, as it is.

If anybody thinks they want one (or more) of these things we had better
figure out how to do it extraordinarily fast. Far as I can tell early
next week is about the latest we could decide we want one and still win.
This doesn't mean we have to write a PO by then, but we probably have
to say we'll do it soon. 

So what does everybody think?

had for the cost of shipping. the following is a list of the stuff that
is available:

	2ea	DF10C	22-bit data channel
	3ea	RH10	Massbuss Interface(use with above)
	4ea	MG10	128 k-36 bit core memory boxes
	10-12	rp04 Disk drives. these have NO PORT MODULES.

All of this equipment was on contract with DEC untill it was turned off
and was in good working order. 

if there is a site out there,or if you know of someone who would like
this equipment,please mail me your address and phone number, and i will
put you in touch with the proper people. hope this doesn't violate some
un-spoken rule on advertising on the net,but then it is "FREE TO A GOOD

In-reply-to: The message of 08 May 85 22:51 +0100 from Peter_Lothberg_STUPI%QZCOM.MAILNET@MIT-MULTICS.ARPA

One more point.  This 1970 paging box was a separate bay, standing next
to bay 1 of the KA (except on the AI machine where it stood next to bay 3
for some reason), containing about half a dozen wire wrap boards of TTL
plus two DEC flip-chip racks full of Systems Concepts DEC<->TTL level
converters and cable connectors.  From the 1985 standpoint, that seems
like a real waste.  If I were doing it today, I would try to design
something using today's TTL parts, packaged on double-height flip-chip
modules, that would fit in the space where the relocate/protect logic
goes that would do the whole job and wouldn't require level convertors.
I'd probably try to use that TI 512-entry cache-directory chip, since
with 256 system pages plus 256 user pages it would fit nicely.

That would be easier and more elegant since you wouldn't need to change
the cabling at all.  Of course there are still the various internal changes
to the processor logic, which would be done by re-wire-wrapping the backplane
and adding standard B-series flip-chip modules where necessary (there is
probably enough spare space since that is how it was done at MIT).

If your 1985-technology paging box didn't turn out 100% software compatible
with the 1970-technology one, there is no harm done since ITS is already
software compatible with three paging boxes and a fourth can be added as
long as it only differs in detail and not in function (the bit layout of
page table words, the exact way page faults are reported, the instructions
to control the paging box, the size and organization of the associative
memory could all be changed).

    Date:        08 May 85 22:51 +0100
    From:        Peter_Lothberg_STUPI%QZCOM.MAILNET@MIT-MULTICS.ARPA
    Message-ID:  <103760@QZCOM>

    I'm the hardware projekt....
    How wide is the adress bus output from the paging box?

I think it varied on each KA10.  In the original design, it was 19 bits
(i.e. just one extra bit was added).  Later a second extra bit was added
to some copies.  And I think that some sections(!) of the memory bus on some
machines were later diddled to have 22-bit addressing compatible with the
KI10 and KL10, but bits 14 and 15 were hard-wired to zero rather than
coming out of the paging box associative memories.  For further complexity,
on one machine there was a pdp6 involved, which had its own idea of the
meanings of some of the memory bus lines that DEC later recycled to be
the extra address bits.

I'd have to check the prints to be sure of the details, but the overall
story is that there is no simple answer.  If you build something, you can
make it do whatever you want, rather than be exactly compatible with any
one of the three copies of the KA10 paging box.  The software really
doesn't care; even the format of page-table entries is parameterized, since
it has been different on every machine ITS has run on.

    Is the data chanel (DF10) a 18 or 22 adress bit device?

Again, there isn't a simple answer.  MIT-AI (the old one: the KA) didn't
have any DF10's.  It had a one-of-a-kind combined disk and serial-line
controller, which was the only DMA device.  If I remember correctly it was
originally an 18-bit address device but was later expanded to 20 bits of
address.  The other devices that you would expect to be DMA (mag tape, dec
tape, ARPA network, 340 display, maybe analog I/O) all worked by using the
KA10's single-instruction interrupt handler feature.  All our KA10's were
modified to have an extra I/O bus cable which added seven additional
interrupt levels, each with its own pair of interrupt instructions in
locations 62-77.  These were all at the same priority level as channel 1 in
the standard interrupt levels (highest priority), hence this was called the
"channel 1 multiplex feature."  If I remember correctly the hardware for
this was a single flip chip module (a custom module designed at MIT, not a
standard DEC module) containing only a few parts.  You might want to do
this too, if you have a lot of I/O devices.

MIT-AI also had a device, which was heavily used for many years although it
never worked reliably, that mapped portions of the pdp10's address space
into eight pdp-11 Unibuses.  The pdp-11's in question (they weren't all
real pdp-11's; one was a Lisp machine and one was a Chess machine) were
scattered around the lab; some were I/O controllers for the pdp-10, while
others were independent machines that just used this device as a high-speed
link to the timesharing system.  The effect of this hardware was to make
pdp-11 memory look like extremely slow pdp-10 memory with the right-hand 4
bits of each word missing.  A user program in the timesharing system could
issue a system call to map an arbitrary portion of an arbitrary pdp-11's
memory into its virtual address space and could then do whatever it wanted
to it.  These references were mapped through the usual virtual-to-physical
page map and then again through a pdp-10-physical to pdp-11-physical page
map located inside the 10/11 interface device.

MIT-ML and MIT-DM (also KA's) had 18-bit DF10's with a special kludge
modification (disabled with a toggle switch for running DEC diagnostics) to
take extra address bits from the complement of some high-order bits of the
count.  The complementation is so that with a small count (which is
negative) you address the low-order memory, for compatibility.  I fear that
idiots may have thrown away the documentation of this modification.

MIT-MC (a KL) has 22-bit DF10's.  MIT-AI (a KS) uses RH-11's in place of
DF-10's!

The software really doesn't care what kind of data channel you use as
long as it can address all of memory somehow.  If it isn't the same as
any of the channels it already knows about a few instructions in several
places would have to be changed.

    The existing page relocating and protection logic circuit is
    it used for any purpose, or is it just "shorted out" ?

It's not used.  If I remember correctly, it is actually removed and the
space in the machine is used for something else.  It's valuable space
because it already has power wiring for TTL logic (I suppose you've discovered
that here and there in the KA10 there is early TTL logic, with its power
and ground offset from the DEC power and ground to make the logic levels
compatible, since they are both voltage logics with the levels separated
by approximately 3 volts).  I'd have to check the prints to see what was
put there.

Incidentally, the way the interface between the processor and the paging
box works is approximately as follows.  The data portion of the memory
bus simply connects to both of them.  Data transfers between the two always
go through memory (there is an instruction that reads eight words from
memory and loads them into all the registers in the paging box, and another
instruction that stores eight words into memory).  The address portion of
the memory bus leaves the processor with a virtual address on it and is
received by the paging box.  It maps the address and drives a second set
of cables with the physical address; the processor doesn't know that it
isn't talking directly to the memories.  I forget who drives the control
portion of the memory bus; I think the processor does, but the paging box
controls what it drives?  In addition to the memory bus, a large number
of control and timing signals pass between the two boxes on several cables.
A lot of the memory-subroutine pulses go back and forth, also instruction
timing signals for the paging-box-manipulating instructions, and signals
associated with page-fault reporting.  The paging box does not connect to
the I/O bus.

    Is the paging box use the existing "memory protection violation"
    interupt/status logic ?

Sort of.  If I remember correctly, there is a big mess of hand changes on
the prints here.  What it amounts to is that it uses the existing logic,
but it has to fix a lot of bugs in it because DEC never intended for it to
be possible to restart an instruction after a memory protection violation.
Things I remember: the store-cycle timing pulses are rearranged to check
for write access to the memory operand before modifying the accumulator;
if a page fault is pending the check for interrupts is done earlier so there
won't be a 1-instruction delay before the page-fault interrupt goes off;
if a page fault is about to go off the store-cycle is inhibited from
changing anything; the PC and PC flags are captured at the beginning of
each instruction by a register in the paging box, so changes to them are
allowed to go through; some bugs with MPV in BLT are fixed.

I hope we can find an accurate KA10 print set with all the ITS modifications.
There really was accurate documentation for each KA10 when we had the KA10s,
but they're all gone now.  I'm not in the right place to look, and I'm also
not in the same place as my personal copy (which is not at all accurate).

By the way, I wasn't present when all these modifications were designed
and implemented.  I know a good deal about them though, since I had to
maintain them for several years.

Thanks for the answer!  OK, we can manage without the schematics
for the paging box. We have a few very good hardware hackers
who can build one from scratch. What we *can't* do is to write
a new ITS (although some of our hackers might disagree...) so
if we could get copies of your ITS tapes we'd be most grateful!
Of course we'll cover the costs for tapes, postage and such.

(At this moment we have 1 KI10, 1 KA10, 2 PDP11/35, 1 PDP12,
and another KI10 and a PDP15 coming in (we hope) to "CCCC",
(Colossal Cave Computing Center, our hobbyist/hackers machine
room). Now all we need is a PDP6 to make our collection complete.
If Anyone Out There... etc)

        I guess it is unlikely, but it would be foolish of anyone else to try
        to assemble and try anything that uses KS-10 I/O instructions....
    Uh huh. Well, let me know when you think they work OK - I do hope to
    deal with the tape code sometime now that I'm back in town..

The I/O instructions work just fine.  Last night we installed Jinx's DZ-11

    Hello, is anybody listening? I am trying to reach David A. Moon with
    this mail (or anyone else who can help me with a set of tapes with
    ITS)! My name is Per Lindberg, and I'm writing this instead of Bjorn
    Danielsson, who has been communication with Moon on this subject. BD
    is busy doing other things right now.

Well, you reached me, but I can't help you right away.  We've really
fallen down on the job of getting back to you.

    We heard that it is possible to get ITS on 7-track tapes on DEC core
    dump format. We can get access to a 7-track tape drive, so it's OK to
    send ITS dump tapes. We can read most formats given some hints on
    what's what. We'll take what you have. (If TECO and EMACS is on the
    tapes we'll be very happy!) If you want a couple of blank tapes in
    advance, just let me know how many and where to send them.

    Also, if anyone has the schematics for the KA10 paging box we'll be
    happy to get a copy of that. We have some hardware hackers that can
    build one.

Last I heard what was holding things up is that somebody needs to go through
these schematics and ink over the pencilled changes so that they can be
copied.  Then we need to find a place that can copy "D" size drawings.
Do you want tapes in advance of this stuff?  The tapes are relatively
easy to send.

    Last time I wrote, we had a KI10 up and running, and a KA10 coming up.
    Now it's running, and the bottle of champagne is opened. 

Yay!

							     (If anyone
    wants to get rid of a PDP-6, we'll be *very* grateful to get it!)

We already got rid of ours I believe.


    You can send the tapes to my address at QZ:

Oh yeah.  Until I get back into microcode hacking again, hackers who debug
programs using DDT on AI will find that features related to single stepping
don't work right.  I'll fix it eventually, I just haven't put in the

I won't be fixing the fact that AI doesn't have a MAR, so somebody should
be fixing DDT to know that some ITS machines lack the feature.

There has appeared beside AI a rack containing on ACC LH/DH-11,
(Arpanet Interface to you).

Even more interesting, it has 3 cables routed from the back of it.
One to power, One to just inside the processor cabinet, and one
connected to port 2 of IMP 6 from whence MIT-AI once graced the
network.

Rumor has it that someone (possible known as CJL) has the technical
documentation for this device.

Judging from the sign on the front that reads "Hack me Please!" I
would suspect that someone somewhere would like unibus code to
interface with this device, which might have the interesting
side-effect of putting MIT-AI on the Internet (ARPANET to you), once
more.

I leave it your conscience what happens next.  Evidentally the poor
device has grown wear of talking to Unix 4.2 vaxen, and longs for 
"the real thing".

I will only say (and you may quote me) 

   "Stranger things have happened!"

The MIT-AI KS10 has now been up and running timesharing for almost two days
without incident.  We are on the Chaosnet, we have COMSAT, EMACS, LISP,
etc. all running just fine.  We do not have tape drive support for backing
up out filesystem yet, and our current filesystem is built on a scratch
pack, so you can't put any files here that you care about, but basically we
are winning completely.

Interesting aside:  It appears that for the last three years the Dover

This morning I formatted a disk pack as an ITS filesystem, created a magic
file containing the bits the 8080 front-end needs to boot the machine,
created a couple of other vital files like .;@ DDT and .;@ NSALV, endowed
the pack with a copy of DSKDMP, and kissed the tape drive goodbye.

Thats right, we have reached the point where it is no longer necessary to
use magnetic tape to load code into the machine.  Now when the machine is
booted from scratch (like when you power cycle the machine, or give the BT
command to the console program), it comes up in DSKDMP.  From DSKDMP you
can read in DDT and the salvager from disk and use the salvager to suck
files over the Chaos net and write them on disk.  Then if you pop back to
DSKDMP you can load them up and start them.  What fun!

If the goddamned I/O instructions would compute their effective address
in the same way as all the other instructions, they would work.  In the
above code, TEM contains the instruction breakpointed, which needs to
be executed in a special way when you proceed from the breakpoint.

I hear they're selling LM-2's at the state surplus place in Taunton.

As a point of interest, DEC's current philosophy involves us giving

    ....I tried running it in standalone on MC and it looks like I broke it a
    little bit, sigh. CHKR immediatly crashes in the INIT code.  I didn't
    really change any of the KL-specific code, so it's probably some
    simple screw-up. I think someone else (Moon?) should take a quick look
    at it: it's probably a trivial bug or typo that I am familiarly
    reading past.

This turned out to be bogus cache-handling code copied from the old salvager.
Chris and I were able to demonstrate the old salvager crashing in exactly the
same way.  Fixed in the source by copying the right cache-handling code from
ITS; I forget whether we tested the fix.

    Things on my mind for the meeting are:

      How do we get file system on the KS?

We decided to copy the key files over the Chaosnet using a new program in the
salvager, then after timesharing runs get other files over the network under
timesharing using FTP or CFTP.  I wrote and debugged the Chaosnet driver part
of the salvager for this (it needs a little more work on error handling I
guess, but basically seems to work).

      Is there an 8080 file system?  What is it?

I think we figured this out last night.  Chris, you're going to write the
routine in the salvager that allocates space for this, fills in the physical
disk addresses in the home blocks and table-of-pointers block, and makes
an ITS file on the . directory that owns the space occupied by the 8080
file system, right?

      DSKDMP?  8080 changes? SHUT command and sw0? (BTW, what about KLINK?)

Good questions.  I think the only thing we decided is the part of ITS that
looks at the switch register and goes to DDT would instead look at location
30 (set by the 8080 SH command).  DSKDMP should be trivial to get running on
the KS, taking just the tty and disk routines from the salvager.  Control your
urge to barf when you see the code in DSKDMP, we don't care as long as it works.

      Strategy for ITS I/O programming, UNIBUS management, etc.
      Get Confuser info and protocol from Taft.
      Ethernet off confuser, Chaosnet off UBA#3?
      An ACC UNIBUS IMP interface?
      Need to hack tape code.
      I'd like to share as much code as possible between ITS and
      random programs.  Disk, Tape? (Net?)
  
Good questions.

The microcode and DDT have been running for a long time, and recently
the Salvager started working.  We are working on putting a file system
on the machine, and writing ITS device drivers in preperation for
initial debugging of ITS itself.

    Re:   AI (the KS10)
    What is the current state of thew new AI?  I have been watching
    [OZ]ARC:AI-KL, but the has been no news for a month!

Yeah, I guess I haven't said anything recently.  My last message was to
announce that I got the microcode support working?  Since then I have been
working on conditionalizing all those places that are sensitive to the
specifics of the processor.  I guess this task is somewhat easier than it
was when ITS was conditionalized for the KL, because most of the processor
dependencies are already known; a string search for "KL10P" sufficed to
find most of them.  I guess I could declare this task complete now (modulo
debugging), all that really remains is to write TTY routines for talking to
the system console through the 8080.  (They are trivial, I almost finished
them tonight.)

Next I get to learn how to interface to a bunch of random devices: the DZ11
terminals, the disk, and the tape drive.  All that stands between us and a
first try at bringing ITS up are disk routines in ITS, disk routines in the
salvager, and a trivial tape reading routine in the salvager so that we can
put a couple of things in the initial filesystem.

I guess I made a bunch of decisions along the way that ITS hackers might be
interested in, but not really much that the typical machine language
programmer will need to know about.  The protocol for one-proceed will be
different, but that remains unimplemented.  There will be a JPC, but that
hasn't been done either.  There will never be a MAR.  There is a new user
interrupt (%PINXI) that will be given to jobs in .IOTLSR mode that touch
Unibus locations with nothing in them.  The protocol for setting the time
is new, so someone need to modify PDSET or supply a new equivalent program.

Oh yeah, I also fixed a couple of problems with "Exec DDT" and the magtape
bootstrap program in the course of experimenting with the machine.  

There still remains a bunch of things to do to make the machine ultimately
useable.  Things like network code.  Code to interface to Taft's "Format
Confuser".  The Format Confuser itself.  Code for booting the machine from
the disk.  Code for frobbing the 8080 filesystem.  Etc.

    Barf.  I was faked out today by DDT not understanding how to assemble typed
    in KS IO instructions properly.  The random kludges necessary to get the
    traditional IO instructions to type in correctly (like "CONI 4," which does
    not put the 4 in the same place as "MOVE 4," does) manage to screw the new
    RDIO/WRIO instructions.  Apparently DDT just checks for ones in the top three
    bits of the opcode to determine that it should do the kludge.  The effect
    is really confusing if you don't know whats going on: you type 
    "RDIO 2,100000" and the answer appears in AC 4.  Perhaps somebody else on
    KS-ITS who wants to help us out would be willing to stomp out this buglet?

    Timesharing DDT has the same bug almost.  It masks out the low two bits of
    the AC field before putting it in the wrong place.

    MIDAS does the right thing by making the kludge a property of the symbol
    rather than a property of its value.

I believe that the right way to fix this is to check whether bits 0-8 of the
word are equal to 700 when storing the AC field.  If they are, it's an old-type
I/O instruction and the AC number is really a device number and needs to
be shifted.  If they aren't, it's a normal instruction and the AC field is
an AC field.  Probably DDT currently checks bits 0-2 instead, but that's wrong.

OK, MC:KSHACK;KSDEFS and MC:SYSTEM;EPT now document the behavior of the ITS
microcode for the KS as it will remain for the indefinite future.  Things
like the JPC, one proceed, and some of the IO instruction and interrupt
ideas in MC:MOON;KSJOBS can wait until we have ITS itself more together.  A
couple macros should make any later switch to new IO instructions painless.
(I'll add such macros to KSDEFS.)  Tomorrow I will make sure my last
twiddles to the microcode really were harmless and install it in the
canonical place.  (Which is MC:KSHACK;GOOD RAM.)

Speaking of features like the JPC and one proceed, here is some bad news
for all you machine language hackers.  This machine is unlikely to ever
have a working MAR.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

    STANFORD COMMISSIONS COMPUTER TO REPLACE LARGE DEC-20'S.

STANFORD--
        Stanford University is negotiating with a small Silicon
Valley company to build large computers to replace the ubiquitous
DECSYSTEM-20s now ``orphaned'' by their manufacturer, Digital
Equipment Corp. (DEC).

        The proposed contract, which would total around $1.4
million, would commision two machines from Foonly Inc. of
Mountain View for delivery early in 1986.  Foonly is owned by
former Stanford student David Poole.

        According to Len Bosack, director of the Computer Science
Department's Computer Facilities, the Foonly F1B computer system
is about four times faster than the DEC model 2060 and 10 times
faster when doing floating-point computations (where the decimal
point need not be in the same place in each of the numbers
calculated) that are characteristic of large-scale engineering
and scientific problems.

        Ralph Gorin, director of Stanford's Low Overhead Time
Sharing (LOTS) Facility -- the academic computer center -- said
the Foonly F1B system, which is totally compatible with the
DEC-20, is an outgrowth of design work done by Poole and others
while at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

        Since 1977, Foonly has built one large system, the F1,
and several dozen smaller systems.  The Foonly F1B is a
descendant of the original F1, with changes reflecting advances
in integrated circuit technology and the architectural
refinements (internal design) of the latest DEC-20s.

        A spokesman for DEC said the company announced last year
it had discontinued work on a successor to the DEC-20, code named
``Jupiter,'' and would continue to sell enhanced versions of the
large mainframe.  Service on the machines was promised for the
next ten years.

        However, said Sandra Lerner, director of the Computing
Facilities at the Graduate School of Business, the
discontinuation of DEC-20 development left approximately 1,000
customers world-wide without a practicable ``growth path.''

        Ten DECSYSTEM-20 computers on campus make that machine the
most numerous large system at Stanford.

        The Graduate School of Business uses its two DEC-20s for
administration, coursework, and research.  The Computer Science
Department uses two systems for research and administration.
LOTS, the academic computer facility, supports instruction and
unsponsored research on three systems and hopes to add one more
in the time before the F1B is available.

        Other DEC-20s are at the Department of Electrical
Engineering, the artifical intelligence project at the Medical
Center (SUMEX), and the recently formed Center for the Study of
Language and Information (CSLI).

        The Stanford University Network (SUNet), the main
university computer communications network, links together the
10 DEC-20s, approximately 30 mid-size computers, about 100
high-performance workstations, and nearly 400 terminals and
personal computers.

        The DEC-20 has been a cornerstone of research in artificial
intelligence (AI).  Most of the large AI systems evolved on the
DEC-20 and its predecessors.  For this reason, Stanford and other
computer science centers depend on these systems for their
on-going research.

        Lerner said the alternative to the new systems would
entail prohibitive expense to change all programs accumulated
over nearly twenty years at Stanford and to retrain several
thousand student, faculty, and staff users of these systems.  The
acquisition of the Foonly systems would be a deliberate effort to
preserve these university investments.

        Nope, no one has said anything (although I have had one request to
        forward whatever the response turns out to be!)

    Briefly, DEC is donating a KS10 with 512KW memory and an RP06 disk and a
    TU77 tapedrive, and two MH10 memories for MC, to MIT.  MIT will have to
    pay for maintenance, though.  The AI lab is going to call the KS10
    "MIT-AI" and run ITS on it.  They're also going to put on reasonable
    disks, ethernet, and maybe 1822 interface to Arpanet.  Reasonable disks
    probably means Fujitsu M2351 (Eagle) via a pdp11 SMD interface and
    a special format-converting hardware device on the Unibus.  I'm helping
    a little but I think people at the AI Lab are going to do most of the
    work.  I guess if it works out MIT might get another KS10 when they
    get rid of MC, or another to replace ML, or something like that, but
    I don't know if there are any real plans or any money.  The KS10 is
    pretty slow (roughly KA10 speed) but they take a lot less power, floor
    space, and maintenance than a KL and if we're lucky they are reliable
    and the price will continue to be right.  (Certainly at list price
    they're a joke.)  I'd expect the KS10 to be somewhat faster than an
    F2 (F3) but don't have any real bits on that.

Additional info, updates, etc would be appreciated.

    It should go on the 9th floor.  Call it AI and put it where AI used
    to be; I think there's even a hole that it can be shuffled into there.

The place where AI used to be is now filled with Vaxen and 3600s.
Putting it there would leave little room for expansion, and the power
situation is tight.

Another possiblity is the 7th floor machine room, although here again
expansion would be hard.

All things considered, I suggest putting the new AI in the CADR corral
where it will have more room for expansion.  There is a lot of room
near the FileComputer, and along the wall adjacent CADR6.  There is
already a lot of power under the floor.

In some ways it would be nice to put the new AI where the old one was,
but it just may not be the best place.

This thing is pretty small, right?  Can we make enough room where AI
used to be to put it there (by flushing, er moving, htvax's lpt for
example).  Do you know the power requirements of the beast so we can
make sure that is done...

I agree with Moon about the name; MIT-OZ just lost its nicknames AI and

Subject: Re: Foonly machine & code availability
To: Ken Harrenstien <KLH@SRI-NIC>

Ken, I guess I the right person to ask most of those questions. let me try ...

[KLH: Are F2s or F3s still available?  What about the newer machines?]

The F2 (or F3 as we call it) is no longer made.  We have  8 but they are all 
used at TYM. Some clients some internal users.

There are two models of interest relating to F4.

System 26 is based on the F4 CPU and runs TENEX. It has ucode that
supports the KA instruction set and emulates the KA TENEX map (pager).
We have several of these, one is at SRI and one at CECOM in New Jersey
(both of these are owned by customer).  This model is no longer being
made although one might be obtainable in the future.

System 26KL is the latest model. It is also based on the F4 CPU but is
modified to support the full extended addressing (actually 32 bits
hardware-wise but that is not used since TOPS-20 does not use all
those bits either). The 26KL has totally different ucode and emulates
the KL instruction set including ALL the extended business instruction
set. it emulates the KL style map.  It runs the TYMCOM-20 operating
System which is user identical to the TOPS-20 system. The 26Kl is
spec-ed at 2.5 times the KA at the machine instruction level.  This
seems to be proved out but we are undergoing a big performance push
right now and hope to have formal data by spring showing this to be at
true.

System 26KL is MOST definitely available for leasing or buying.  We
are gearing up for production of these beasts.  There is a strong
backing internally to use these machines for internal use in addition
to external sales/leases. This provides a built in demand.

the cost of a nicely configured system (1 meg memory, a few  disks (660 MB), 
etc.) is about $300,000.  You could probably push on that for universities but 
not sure how much.

Yes, we are willing to provide access to ucode but this has yet to be
made a firm committment from upper management. The front end (if used
in the KL sense) does NOT exists.  There is a Console computer that is
used for booting and diagnostic work but has no relationship with I/O
functions of the mainframe.

We have TYMNET but no MILNET yet since we do NOT have the TCP/IP
sources for TOPS-20 (can we get that from someone?? we do have a
source license for TOPS-20 so I think we are entitled to it).

We are anxiously seeking out programmers for both the monitor level
work and for ucoding. I have two opening right now.  We have hired a
few enginerring types to help with manufacturing and for enhancements.
I personally would love to have cooperative ventures with
universities.

Let me know if there is more interest from any quarters.

[KLH: I asked for more details on the speed differences...]

The 26KL has NO cache and although it is on the list of possible items
to do, we currently have NO plans to implement it.  You first have to
understand why a cache on the 2060 is worth it. The memory cycle time
is something like 800 ns so a cache can have a very dramatic effect.
The 26KL has a memory cycle time of 350 to 425 depending on how we set
some parameters.  Right now we can run with no problems at 375 ns.
Thus, we feel the cache will NOT provide a significant enhancement of
performance as compared to some other ideas.

The 26KL instruction speed (running the KL set) varies from lower than
the KL (I won't say figures) to higher than the KL. On the average
(what ever that means) it seems to come out to about 60% of the KL.
Remember this is an instruction set speed comparison.  I think the
2060 wins bigger in the I/O due to multiple controllers. Currently two
is the max for the 26KL.

We have a very nice list of wonderful things we can do with the 26kl
to make it much better (VERY likely better than the 2060) but one
OVERRIDING factor MUST happen.  WE MUST SEE IF THE MARKETPLACE WILL
ACCEPT THE 26KL.  (basically as is).  If not it does not make sense
for us to develop it.  We are rounding it out now and cleaning it up.
It really is there and works. Several are at TYM now.  We are very
anxious to see the marketplace show interest.  It did at the show but
that seems to have died off.  Very disappointing. (of course you may
find fault with the lack of heavy advertising on our part, regretably
that is a fact but not sure if that would have changed the situation).
Whatever the marketplace says, TYM is very committed to produce these
machines for internal use if for not other reason. However, future
effort will key off of marketplace acceptance.

The complete instruction set is there, full addressing is there. A
wonderful implementation of the KL map is there.  Power, size and cost
seem to heavily favor the 26KL.  With TYM maint., we can provide the
whole thing.

[KLH: I asked whether the price could be cut by leaving off the
suede leather trim, racing stripes, etc.]

Now for costs. certainly a barebones CPU (with 1/2 meg memory) can go
for much less than the 300k figure. I will leave that up to the
marketing types. Yes, i heard the 250k rumor but when you add
everything else, it is easily 600k or more. So we are still 50% of
their [KLH: DEC-2060] cost.

Hope this helps.

I would contact Cal Peterson for marketing info. I don't have his
number here at home but will send it to you later.

[KLH: I asked about the status of unbundling TOPS-20 -- not relevant
to ITS, but interesting.]

As for software on the 26KL, it is a matter of legalese on what
TYMCOM-20 is.  Certainly TOPS-20 cannot run on the 26KL and TYMCOM-20
cannot run on the DEC equipment.  We have very different architecture
which means parts of the monitor must be VERy different. however, from
the user view, we are as identical as one can be. So what is it??  We
claim, with some legal opinion, that TYMCOM-20 is NOT TOPS-20 and
hence no licensing is needed by us or our customers.  We certain do
realize this might not completely dispell the fear of some legal
action by DEC so we are trying hard to talk to DEC to clarify all
this. TO date they are VERY hardnose.  I think everyone agrees they
are trying to delay things with the hope we just go away or die.

My point of view says this is very short sighted for DEC, bad for
their customers, and extremely sad for all those fans of the DEC 36
bit line.  I sincerely wish to join forces with DEC and have mutual
software develoment for the 36 bit line. DEC can do somethings and TYM
can do others.  Clearly the DEC 36 bit machines are now in the end of
the line phase.  If DEC wants to keep its base and hopes to move them
onto the DEC 32 bit line, they need to do more.  Joining with TYM will
be a GIANT step forward. DEC has NO hope to convert those 36 bit sites
to VAXen in the next 2 years.  Why not hold onto them by letting them
use a TYM 26KL.  Eventually (if we are to believe DEC) the VAX will be
bigger and better and more convenient for a 36 bit to VAX move. As I
view it, we are really saving DEC!!!!

-----------------------

KLH: Well, it doesn't look as if a Foonly will be vastly cheaper than
a DEC machine, but it does seem to have more potential than a 2020.
The microcode differences may or may not make it harder to modify the
paging; again, I can't judge this.  If anyone wanted to pursue the
cooperative angle, it may be possible to get a much better deal,
although it's not clear whether Tymshare would expect improvements to
TYMCOM-20 rather than to the machine, interfacing, or microcode.  If
for some reason anyone wanted to bundle together an ITS for export
outside MIT, a 26KL would be an attractive direction to go in.  I just
wish they were faster about getting the installed base in place.

If anyone does contact Rob for more info, I would appreciate being
CC'd on it...

i think you are confused; ML and MC ARE ITS machines, and many of the
people who maintain them are AI people.  LCS is theorectically getting rid
of ML as soon as there are enough lines (terminal concentrator or direct)
into MC to adequately serve the ML users, since ML is hardwarily dying.
LCS is also theorectically getting rid of MC in a couple of years; it is
not clear whether this time schedule will be adhered to. the continued life
of ITS depends on AI getting some machinery which runs ITS.

    I too am reluctant to recommend that a 2020 be procured.

Their main virtue is the claim that they can be obtained for free,
because they are useless for running Tops-20, and will be maintained by
DEC.  At $99K they are no bargain.  Especially if 2060's are down to
$250K now.

    How does its speed compare with the MC KL-10?

It looks like a factor of 4 slower but I haven't seen any detailed numbers.
You certainly couldn't load it up heavily; but as a network mail server
it could be worthwhile.  Think of it as a replacement for AI or ML, not
as a replacement for MC.  Or OZ.

There is this theory, which has not been carefully evaluated but does make
a lot of sense, that the reason Tops-20 is so slow on the 2020 is because
Tops-20 simply does not fit in 512K.  ITS, with its non-paged executive, tenser
code, and much fewer features, would do better on a small machine.  That's
the theory.

    The 2020/2060 differences are not trivial, but someone who knows more
    about it than I do would have to comment on how these differences
    affect their ability to run ITS.  I just have the gut feeling that
    getting a 2020 is practically equivalent to resurrecting the AI KA-10
    (and a lot more expensive).

I've looked at the KS-10 microcode enough to figure out what needs to be
done to make it into an ITS machine.  It's not too bad.  It would be a lot
less expensive than resurrecting the AI KA-10, since an entire industry would
have to be recreated from scratch to do the latter.  At $99K it's no bargain
though, but at a nominal price plus the addition of AI-lab-supplied disks
and ethernet interface it would be worthwhile.

    I don't believe it is possible to buy a F-2 any more; Tymshare is
    getting all of Foonly's output (F-4?s) for their new TYMCOM-20
    systems (which are supposed to run TOPS-20 like a 2060).  I don't
    know how much work would be required to modify the microcode of
    this latest Foonly to run ITS.  Probably more than a DEC 20, but
    Moon is likely the only person who can evaluate that (the F4 ucode
    is not greatly different from the F2 I believe, although the F4
    is a much better machine).

The F-2 and KS-10 are comparable as far as microcoding goes.  That is,
the internal organizations of the machines are completely different, and
the microcode looks quite different, but what you have to do for
page-mapping is conceptually the same.

are going to the trouble of buying a 20 you might as well get
something reasonable.  It would be easier to justify, perhaps, if
you pointed out that the machine could always be switched over
to TOPS-20 if all ITS people suddenly died off; and a 2020 does NOT
have the capacity to run the latest versions (including TCP/IP) of
TOPS-20!!!  How does its speed compare with the MC KL-10?  I haven't
been able to find a network 2020 to run timing tests on... probably
a significant datum by itself.

My experience is that the 2020 is a VERY slow machine, by
comparison with the 2060 we're used to. As such, given the
computron-hunger of AI lab users, I think it is completely
impractical as a time-sharing machine. 
It still might be worth getting the 2020 if it had a specialized 
use such as running ITS for an Arpanet connection and mail server. 
The money would probably be better spent buying a 3600, lambda, or
extras like disks, memory, color displays, [I'd vote for the 
latter] for the machines we already have. Or how about another printer?
[Well, I guess we don't really need one, the Dover is so reliable].
I'd suggest you ask to try before you buy.

For a point of comparison, that price ($99K) is slightly higher than the
price for a comparably-configured Foonly F-2, a machine of comparable
performance and physical dimensions.  You expect to pay a premium for a
DEC machine, but it still seems pretty high for a used computer.

What's the price without the (presumably overpriced) DEC tape drive and disk?
Is one or both of these required in order to have a maintenance contract?
Note that in any case it will be necessary to put additional disks on it, so
the RP06 is useless unless DEC requires it.  It is understood how to put
additional disks on, cost-effectively, using hardware available at the AI lab.
What's the story on the free KS-10?  JTW, have you heard lately?

Did Linda offer this $99K as a special, good-deal price, or is this the normal
price?  If the latter, what happens if you say "well we think we can one for
free, and $99K seems kind of high, can we deal?"

    I mentioned in passing that we would likely need access to the
    microcode, and she said she would check on that too, but did not seem

The machine will be unusable without the ability to change the microcode.
It won't take enormous changes, but it will take some.

It would likely have to be expanded to 512K.  I think we'd like to put non-DEC
disks on it, e.g. Eagles on a Unibus SMD controller.  This requires a fairly
simple custom Unibus device, which JTW, Taft, and I discussed once, to make
it possible to use efficiently an SMD controller that transfers 16-bit words.

I just talked to Linda again.  She talked to the Field Service people
with the KS.  It looks like they are still trying to find a buyer for
it.  I made it clear that we are VERY interested in it (at the right
price of course).

Linda thinks that it is a KS, with 384k, and is running with some
small disks (RM03s are small I think, don't have my catalog with me).
But anyway, she says she will talk to the guy again this week, and she
will get back to me next Monday (I told her I would call her Tuesday
if I didn't hear from her on Monday).  I told Linda that we would
almost certainly be getting a service contract on this machine if we
got it (I can see Lester and D'Avolio smiling now).  She will try to
get a price by next week on this for us.

I think PHW would be receptive to getting this machine if we could get
it for less than 100k (the close to 50k the better).  If we got it,
and got it running reliably, maybe LCS (I've heard Dave Clark has an
open mind on this), might be willing to get one too to replace ML.
KS processors are about the size of two 3600's side by side.

I don't want to get hopes up too high on this, but all the signs are
there for some "guarded optimism".

My last message left people wondering what 750s have to do with this
business of getting machines to run ITS.

Basically they have nothing to do with running ITS, or with the
current project.  It was diversionary to mention them, and I am sorry
for the confusion I caused.  I was attempting to explain how I spent
the hour I talked to Linda.  I am also interested in getting a 750,
more out of the belief that it would be good to know how to hack them,
and that they can do useful things (relatively speaking).  I would
rather have an ITS, but this is not a one-or-the-other deal as far as
I can tell.

And yes, I believe that COMSAT is the best mailer for the job of
moving mail.  And I think that I would much rather work on a machine
where there are ITS hackers who, even if sometimes they flame too much
for my taste, are bright, informed, and can fix the bugs that they
find.

I ran into PHW this afternoon, and told him that I have met with
Linda, and that she says that she is trying to find a KS (2020) or a
KL (2060) for us.

She said that she had heard that Field Service was looking for a buyer
for one, and that she was going to try to get in touch with them on
this. 

Well, anyway, here's what we're talking about for a NEW one:

     110,000  for the processor, 384k, and 1 RP06 drive
      20,000  for the other 128k memory so we can have 512k
      36,000  for a TAU77 (unibus, 9trk, TU77, 800/1600bpi, autoload)
      34,000  for an extra RP06 (apparently one comes with it)
     -------
     200,000

Now, here's some improvements to this deal.

      50,000  for the processor, memory (512k)
      36,000  for a TAU77 
     -------
      86,000

I'm guestimating what a second-hand processor might cost.

The disk theory is that we could take a couple of the RP06s from OZ
and get an RP07 or two to replace them.  DEC is giving 7k for RP06s
these days so it can stop making them and put them on the 20s it is
still selling.  We could likely justify replacing some of the RP06's
on OZ with RP07's in light of the perpetual space crunch.  (an RP07 is
about 3 RP06s).

So that's the story so far.  Hints, comments, constructive criticism,
are all welcome.  I haven't heard back Linda on the KS-10 yet, and
yes, she is also looking for a KL still.

I will call her tomorrow (and tomorrow and tomorrow...).

    i don't quite understand why you want a vax. you were saying you would
    want to run unix on it, and i gather you intend to make it the AI
    machine on the arpanet. but from what i understand, the unix mail
    system is incredibly horrible; it appears to trash headers with great
    regularity and cause other problems.

Indeed, the mail system in 4.1bsd is complete shit.  If you
thought Symbolics screwed the world with a release that insisted
MIT-MC was named DM and OZ was named AI, you ain't seen nothing
until Unix rapes the mail headers.

I have been told that 4.2 fixes all of this.  I won't believe
this until I see it; not enough SCRC Vaxes are running 4.2 to get
enough mail traffic to tell.

I finally met with Linda Crawford, our DEC hardware salesperson.  She
basically didn't have much exciting to say.  She says there are not
that many KL model A's in circulation anymore, since Field Service
doesn't want to service them, people have mostly upgraded rather than
trading them in.

She is going to look for a refurbished KL model B next.

She mentioned that she may have a lead on a KS (2020) which F-S is
trying find a buyer for.  

I basically got a list of prices for new equipment which is very
expensive,  and also a quote on a 750.

She gave me promises of calling back with more info.
I will try to give her a call tomorrow afternoon to let her know we
are very interested, especially in the KL type hardware.

I am still trying to find us a KL of some flavor.

I have a meeting this Thursday with Linda Crawford, the person at DEC
that handles hardware sales to MIT to discuss this (among other
things).  I have already told her what sort of machine and peripherals
we are looking for, and she claims to be looking.

As for selling this machine to PHW, if Indeed Linda comes up with a
machine with a reasonable price where price is a little vague right
now, people should start letting PHW know that there is interest.

I will report back what goes on Thursday at the meeting.

The timing issues involved here is that space is sort of first-come

have to get it before 3600's fill up the space, else we'll have
to find somewhere else to put it.

I talked to Linda Crawford from DEC today, and also to Lester "The
Molester" Saucer, about their efforts to find a machine.

Linda (who is is hardware sales), is trying to find a "refurb" 20
which we can get at a real low price. Les is also looking.
The refurbished 20's are warrantied like new ones, and we of course
would get a service contract.

Not much to do now but to wait for a price.  From what they are
saying, it looks like we might get:

a 2060 (model "B" processor),
1 meg memory
2 or 3 RP04's,
a 9trk tape drive,
2 11/34s,
2 DH11's (32 ports),
1 decrotter (probably 1220baud).

I'll let you know when I get a quote.

    From: Martin David Connor <MARTY@MIT-OZ>

    Question:
    What model number (TU-??) is MC's tape drive?

    Right now I am thinking for starters we need:

    2 RP04's
    1 KL Model A CPU
    1 7 track tape drive
    Memory
    1 or 2 11's for network interface.

Get a 9-track tape drive.  In the long run it will be more useful than a 7-track
tape drive.  In the short run, AI backup tapes can be read on ML or MC and sent
through the network, then either put on-line or dumped onto 9-track tape.  The
reasons for wanting a 9-track tape drive are higher speed (1600 bpi vs. 800 bpi
for 7-track), better maintainability, and compatibility with other machines such
as OZ and VAXes.  Of course if you can find a free 7-track drive that can go on
the same controller, get one of them, too.  Depending on the kind of machine it
might have a controller compatible with ML's drive or one of AI's old drives,
which could be brought over temporarily.

2 RP04's are much better than 1, but if they're expensive it could be worth
considering one.  The only issue here is how long it takes DEC to fix you
only RP04 when it breaks.  They are guaranteed to break.

I don't think it matters a whole lot whether the CPU is model A or B.  The
microcode for model A is already done, but as I recall it would be trivial to
make it work for model B.  Model A might be a win because of having a lower
resale value (being slower and cruftier), thus costing less.

The big issues in KL10 configuration that you haven't mentioned are whether it
uses internal (20-type) or external (KA/KI-compatible) memory, and whether or
not it has an external (KA/KI-compatible) I/O bus.  "1080" machines like MC
have external memory and I/O bus.  Takes up a lot of floor space but gives you
a little more flexibility and a higher performance pdp11 interface if you have
a DL10 (it's unclear to me that you want a DL10).  Adding device drivers for
the RH20 (internal memory and I/O) tape and disk controllers to ITS would not
bve very hard, so that shouldn't be a consideration.  Considerations are price,
maintainability, and whether you have any old-type things you want to connect
up (I wouldn't recommend ARM10s, but maybe they're better than no memory).  If
the ML and/or DM machines are going to go away, is there any issue of attaching
some of their more reliable memory or peripherals to this new machine?

    Questions:

    How much memory do we need?
As we've seen you can operate with 512KW, or even somewhat less.  1MW would be better.
256KW would be a joke.

    How many and what flavor 11's?
I guess DCP answered this.  The one that comes with the machine is enough, barely.
The absolute need for a second one with TOPS-20 is due to software.  If it's not
expensive a second DTE-20 interface and a second 11 running MINITS (maybe this
second 11 could be one you already have) might help with performance and with
Internet support).

    What sort of hardware do we need for ARPAnet support?
JNC's claim that you want no hardware, and instead use ethernet as a way to get
to the existing gateway onto the Arpanet is probably the right thing.  With an
external I/O bus you could go find AI's Arpanet interface, but it will have
considerably lower performance on a KL than on a KA (interrupt system brain
damage) and might well become a maintenance headache.  You could replicate
MC's interface, again requiring an external I/O bus.  It could turn into
a maintenance headache eventually since some of the parts it's made out of
haven't been manufactured for several years.

    What other hardware do we need?
Controllers for disk and tape.  Whether these are freestanding cabinets or
just boards inside the KL depends on whether you have internal or external
interfaces.  In the free-standing cabinet version you need at least one
DF10C data channel (two if you have a TM10C DMA tape controller and want
extra performance, but you can share a DF10 between disk and tape controllers
(DM does--I think it's the reason their disk used to get clobbered, but that
was only superstition).  DEC operating systems only support DMA tape controllers,
but our microcode (bugs fixed for the Arpanet interface) should support either.)

Front-console decwriter.

Do you want any hardwired line controllers in the pdp11, or do you want to
have all network terminals?  MC uses DH11s, other interfaces could be programmed
easily enough.

Did you check on whether anything from the WPI machine remains in the basement,
whether LCS (presumably DDC rather than AV now) will let you use it, and
whether it's useful?

    I will be talking to the salesman again soon, so if we could agree on
    a minumal starting configuration, that would help me to get an initial
    price. 

It would probably be best to research prices for both external-memory-and-I/O
configurations ("1080") and internal-memory-and-I/O configurations ("2060").
"1090" is some kind of hybrid, maybe it's internal busses but painted blue?
People should be more willing to get rid of the external kind, but maybe it
costs more because it has so much more iron and steel in it.  The external
kind is easier on the software and would allow connecting up old stuff that's
lying around the lab, but those may not be compelling arguments.

Also you should seriously consider my suggestion of using SMD disks on pdp11s
for expansion after the initial one or two RP04s.  This pdp11 can be shared with
the network-interfacing pdp11 if it has enough memory.

    Seeing the problem MC has with volume of tape, it may be worth
    considering 1600 bpi, even though that would not be able to be read
    elsewhere.  If it could deal with 800 also then it could at least read
    tapes from the other machines, and backups made by paranoid
    individuals could be made at 800.  ITS can deal with this, can't it?
    I seem to remember a bit or field somewhere which gave this
    information.

You can set the density on tape drives to one of four values.  The default
could easily be changed from 800 to 1600 in the software if the hardware
supported it.  A 9-track 800/1600 drive could not read 7-track 800 bpi tapes
from other machines, but see the argument above as to why that's not important.

	I talked to Dave Clark today about MC. He really hasn't picked
up on what's going on in detail yet, but he was generally very
receptive to keeping ITS around in the long term, subject to the
proviso that the maintainence doesn't turn into an impossibility or a
drain. The fact that ITS now has good InterNet software was THE key
point, and the fact that the hardware was almost all over the shelf
(although things like the ARM and disk controller could be a problem)
and was vendor-maintained was also essential. He's also very
interested in coordinating with the AI Lab on ITS maintainence, and is

	I would think two RP0X's, in case one croaks; the system could still
be booted. Also, in the normal (i.e. 2 disks up) case I would think that
that would obviate paging off the UNIBUS disks. Also, I don't know if
ITS does overlapped seeks, but if so that would also increase the paging
throughput.

Subject: Disks
To: ai-kl@MIT-OZ

It occurs to me that it might make sense to use Fujitsu M2351s ("Eagles")
for disks.  In any case it is necessary to have one RP04 or RP06, dual-ported
on the 10 and the 11, in order to have DEC maintenance.  And DEC maintenance,
as much of a circus as it is, is essential.

But for disks after the first, you want to use something cost-effective.
I get the impression that at the AI lab Eagles cost nothing and are available
in infinite supply, if you know who to filch them from.  MC manages satisfactorily
with disks running through a pdp11, although there is a significant penalty both
in performance and in disk capacity (it takes 48 bits of disk to store each
36-bit word, thus 25% of the disk capacity is wasted).  If a new machine doesn't
have a DL10 and has to use a DTE20 to talk to the pdp11 with the disks, as
seems very likely, there is an additional performance penalty of 5 or 10
milliseconds of pdp10 cpu time blown away for each 1K word transfer to or
from disk.  But it's better than nothing, and you can try to page off the RP04
as much as possible, or have a large enough ratio of memory to load that you
don't page too much, or just be glad the machine isn't as slow as a KA.  This
would all be contingent on having a Unibus SMD controller with enough buffering
that it can succeed in interfacing such a high speed disk to such a slow machine
(pdp11).  The software issues, in both pdp10 and pdp11, are not insurmountable
at all.

Actually I think I know how to eliminate the disk capacity problem, with suitable
KL10 microprogramming (to allow bytes that span word boundaries in DTE20 transfers,
so you can transfer 16-bit bytes instead of 12-bit bytes).

	    Well, I wouldn't mind lending a hand if it's desired. I've
    pored over the IOELEV code a lot (for a variety of strange reasons,
    like looking at the PUP code, etc), and I know 11's inside out, so if
    you want a hand with the Internet code I could find the time to hack
    that.  The code to talk to the 10 is unknown to me, so I'd not be much
    use there.
Well that's the main hard part, always.

	    Still, lets not count chickens, etc. But the point about
    another 11 is well taken. Speaking of which, does anyone have any idea
    of the % load that the 2 11's on MC are under now? (The IOELEV main loop
    doesn't WAIT so the easy hack of having the clock in check the PC is
    nogo.) 
A second 11 might also be a good idea if the will of the wisp KL10 has
MOS memory, thus requiring more of the DEC brain damage to reside in the 11.
I presume we don't have (ahem) access to up to date sources for this.
I'm sure it would be trivial to make ITS talk to MINITS.

Looking at the lights on the DL10 suggests that except for running the disks
that 11 is lightly loaded.  Presumably one would not have to put disks on the
11 on any new machine, since DL10s are much more expensive than disk drives
these days and the company that made MC's Unibus disk controller is dead if
I remember correctly.

    Also, how much memory is unused in those machines?
None.  On the main one, the memory is full of DEC brain damage (probably there
is really a couple of K of space free, since it has 28K of memory).  On the
auxiliary one there is only 16K, and between disk buffers, network buffers
for three interfaces, terminal buffers, DDT and a symbol table there isn't
any memory left.  If desperate one could remove the symbol table of course.

You can get 11STNK to print a map of memory (but you have to know how much
physical memory is in the machine and what is taken up by KLDCP on the
main 11).

hand-built frob in the machine is a major advantage to not connecting
to the ARPANet, although other considerations (e.g. bandwidth (to IP
machines at MIT, etc)) do come in.

	Two quick points about network related stuff (if you aren't
interested in networks, skip the rest of this). All hosts are supposed
to get their routing info from ICMP Redirects and only from Redirects;
they use these to maintain a cache of routes to gateways for machines
not on their local net that they are currently talking to. This should
be true whether you're connected to the ARPANet or some local net. The
whole point of splitting ICMP off from GGP/EGP/SGP was that the hosts
are insulated from changes in the routing algorithms. The cache thing
is pretty simple to implement too. Packets on a new connection to
a host not in the table get sent to any random gateway in the table;
he'll tell you where to send them.
	I agree that flow control in the InterNet over multi-hop paths
of wildly varying delay and bandwidth is an unsolved problem of some
magnitude. This has been showing up since the earliest days of SatNet
(ca 1978), and while we don't have a solution, we have a much better
understanding of the problem now and I would suspect that considerable
progress will soon be made.
	[ For instance, we used to think that the hosts should do
'traffic control' (we use this term to distinguish flow control for
network wide reasons from flow control at the two hosts on the
connection) using measured round-trip delay and setting the TCP
window. Much experimentation with this has convinced us that this is
incorrect (the traffic window should depend on the bandwidth of the
link as well as the delay, and it's impossible to measure that
directly from the host; the only way to do it is to step up the data
rate until you start to experience greater delays, or some equally
indirect kludge which often has loop stability problems), and that to
do so overloads the TCP window mechanism in any case. So we're back to
the drawing boards, but I think this time we understand enough to do
it right. It will probably involve the gateways (which really do know
the state of their links and buffer pools, etc) and Source Quenches,
but the algorithm in the gateways will be a little more complicated,
so that it can do real traffic control (i.e. slow things down as you
near the useful limit) instead of 'congestion control' (which is what
you do when you go into overload). Also, the whole interface between
TCP and IP needs to be revamped to allow this sort of flow control
info to flow between the two layers; this is the point of Dave Clark's
'UpCall' programming style for network protocols. I forget the IEN no,
but it's a must to read. The newer IP/TCP implemetations at MIT (e.g.
for SWIFT) use this model. ]
	Actually, MC almost certainly has traffic control problems
now, if you're talking to machines on a fast (e.g. ProNet) or slow
(e.g. SatNet) net, but since most of you aren't you don't see it. In
the first case, packets get thrown away now on the gateway into the
ARPANet; in the second, they get thrown away in the gateway off the
ARPANet. 'Large network systems are unfortunately never very simple.'
Anyway, enough flaming about networks.

I'm willing as well, but I don't claim competency with IOELEV.
I've looked at it and XNETWK (the originaly 20X chaos NFE, which
in theory is based on parts of IOELEV).  Making it understand an
Interlan (which I assume would be the plan) probably isn't
impossible.  The harder questions are more like:
    Will it be supporting disks like MC's IO-11?
    Will it talk over a DL-10 or will it use a DTE?
If putting Ethernet and minimal IP in IOELEV poses a problem,
perhaps you should budget for another 11.

I am curious to know what is going on with this hypothetical AI KL
project, but this message is really about gateways.  

One other advantage of using a gateway to access the Arpanet is that
you can let the gateway worry about routing, i.e. the gateway serves
as an intelligent interface to the network and takes on the burden of
deciding where packets should optimally be sent.  The code to do this
sort of thing tends to be rather hairy and unpleasant to work with,
and a situation where a machine has only one gateway to worry about
can actually be considered a boon in this respect.  Of course, the
gateway had better be as reliable as possible, and it should ideally be
a "prime" gateway itself which participates in the Internet gateway
gossip protocol.  Or you will have a lot of frustrated ICMP redirects.

On the other hand, using a high speed local link to the gateway means
that flow control is apt to be a problem; packets can pile up at the
gateway much faster than they can be sent through the arpanet.  ITS IP
does not implement the source quench feature.  Since the Arpanet tends
to be slower (due to bandwidth and RFNM wait blocking; ITS does count
RFNMs) than most local nets, and the Arpanet is the first step outward
from MC or ML, this has not really been a problem up to now.  But when
it is possible to zap out packets as fast as they are created, I won't
be surprised to see a very high rate of packet lossage at the gateway
unless it and ITS agree on some way to throttle the flow.  ICMP should
work, it just needs to be further implemented.

Anyway, I suspect it is much easier to deal with stuff hung off the
IO-11 unibus than with a custom KL-UDGE circuit.  Certainly if it
is possible to get another KL ITS for AI, the question of whether
to try hooking it to an IMP or a local IP net is an extremely minor
point compared with all the other issues involved.  Do whatever is
easiest (politically and financially).

    dave, how much trouble would it be to bring up ITS on a KL that doesn't
    have RP04s? would it be easier to drag one of MC's disks over for a while
    to start things up than to arrange for dealing with some other variety of
    disk? would it be easier to hack with tapes?

Dragging one of MC's disks anywhere is not a good idea.  The best approach is
probably to use tapes to bring the salvager over, then use the salvager's
facility for building a file system from dump tapes.  The salvager, ddt, and
ITS would all need modifications to handle different disks, but they aren't
difficult.  There are a number of strange oddities in the KL file system, having
to do with the front-end 11.  I would be willing to help out.

    also, noel was wondering who besides you and DCP can competently hack code

	A slight typo in the last message. The number for bytes through
the gateway are off by 10 (in case you wondered why the average message
size was 6 bytes!) They are 332.9 MBytes in and 297.1 MBytes out.

	BTW, I took a look into the gateway to check its traffic figures.
Since the last reload (23 days ago) it has received 4.5 million packets
(33.3 Mbytes) and sent 5.2 million (29.7 Mbytes). That's about
200K packets a day. By constrast, MC (in 51 hours) has received 821
thousand packets and sent 784 thousand, or about 400K packets a day.
ML (in 79 hours) has received 270 thousand and sent 343 thousand,
or about 100K packets a day.
	So the gateway can definitely handle quite a good load, and
in addition is seen to be quite robust.

In-Reply-To: Your message of 12-Aug-83 0246-EDT

	The problem is not the gateway, but the ARPANet. The identical
C-GateWay (CGW) software and hardware configuration (albeit an 11/23
in place of the 11/03) with DMA interfaces to the ProNet (LCSNet ring)
and EtherNet has almost 1MBit/Sec bandwidth, so the machine itself
can really zap those little bits out. The real bottleneck is the ARPANet
port. To some degree the limiting factor here is in the IMP software;
the DMA 1822 (IMP<->Host) interface on the machine has more than enough
bandwidth to absorb both phone lines out of MIT (56KBit/sec on each
of them) by itself.
	The whole problem of getting sufficient bandwidth through the
ARPANet stems from the ancient design on the IMP-Host protocol, which
is a hangover from the days of NCP. (The problems MC has been having
recently with IMP blocking are an example of this. Each host is only
allowed to have so many packets outstanding to another host, at which
point the IMP will refuse to take any more at all; the problem is that
the number which will trigger this is not a constant, but depends on
the network load and the load on the IMPs at each end, and there's no
way for the host software to find out at any instant what it is.) It
includes many features that get in the way of an efficient TCP, but
were necessary for NCP, e.g. reliable sequenced packet streams, etc.
The problem is that the network wide congestion and traffic flow
algorithms were designed to work with this type of traffic, and so
changing the interface means more than just reprogramming the host
interface; the resource control algorithms in the network must be
redone. As you might expect, this is a complicated task. The 'Non
Blocking Host Interface' (see your 1822 spec) has been in design for
a while now, but there's still no sign in sight.
	On the short term, there are several things we can do, including
some incredible hacks, to increase the bandwidth through that machine
to the ARPANet. First off, we need to finish off the final bell in
the ARPANet software, which is to count RFNM's (ignore the rest of this
if the jargon threw you) and hang on to packets which are guaranteed
to cause the interface to block. We left this out at the start, in the
rush to get something running, but I think this is starting to hit us now.
It certainly needs to be completed before the ARPANet driver for the CGW
is done. I have just implemented a cache manager which should make it
very easy to do this.
	Past that, we get into a bunch of gorgeous hacks that are
impossible to pull with a machine directly connected to the ARPANet,
but which are possible for a gateway. Basically, you just plug in more
IMP ports to the same machine. The current ARPANet software for the
CGW will handle multiple ARPANet interfaces (this feature was
originally to interface between the ARPANet and one of its clones; BRL
uses this); only a small intermediate layer between IP and the network
layer needs to be written to spread the packets out.  You can split
your transmit traffic between them trivially, since the hosts or
gateways at the far end don't care what the ARPANet address of the
sender is. Splitting receive traffic is a little more complicated, but
fairly easy. (It's also impossible with a directly connected host.)
Basically, machines on the ARPANet that aren't gateways are redirected
to the secondary IMP interface with an ICMP Redirect, which everyone
is supposed to implement now.  (You can't do this to gateways because
the use a second protocol to find out where the all are, and this
would confuse them, but it works just fine with hosts, since the
gateway they are talking to is allowed to send them Redirects; it
would take no software changes to any hosts at all.) You can just
add interfaces until we can soak up the entire 112 KBit/sec out of
MIT with one machine.
	This brings me to a final point; MIT is scheduled to get
a 3MBit/sec satellite link 'soon'. Needless to say, its direct
connection will be to some local net here, not the ARPANet.
The only way to get anything like that bandwidth out of it would
be to talk through local nets exclusively.
	So I guess the answer is basically 'yes'. If anything I said
was confusingly detailed (or glossed over) let me know and I'll go
over it in more detail.

noel, about your idea of hanging things together:

arpa--gateway11--ethernet--newAI's11--newAI(--newAI's11--chaos)
 <----------TCP/IP---------------------/ \----chaos protocol--->

how much load is that gateway going to be able to take?  will it REALLY
take everything an ITS KL (with lots of ai people furiously sending mail
and connecting to arpa sites all over) can dish out?
