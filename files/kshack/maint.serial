    I don't know what the long alphanumeric string on the punch card on
    the front of AI is, but it's not the serial number....

It's not the -processor- serial number, but it is (or may be) the -system-
serial number.  I have tried giving DEC processor serial numbers when
logging a service call, and they always insist that that won't do them any
good.  As near as I can tell, the "system serial number" is a magic string
that DEC makes up that collectively applies to all of your equipment (and
isn't written on any of it).  Presumably this is a useful concept if you
have a service contract covering your "system", and is pointless otherwise
-- but DEC still wants it for their paperwork.

The weather station is a good idea, I'll talk to Tom about it.  No
promises, but from noises he's made before he might be interested.

Here are the serial numbers for all five CPUs.  This does not mean
that I expect you to get all of them PM'ed.

	AI:  4627
	ML:  4653
	MC:  4649
	MD:  4648
	BLT: 4380

I don't know what the long alphanumeric string on the punch card on
the front of AI is, but it's not the serial number.  All four ITS
KS-10s have stickers with their serial numbers on the outside of the
back of the processor, just above the door.  Brave Little Toaster (aka
LSD, the one running Twenex) has a sticker on its front panel.
Additionally, all of them have their serial numbers scribbled on a
parts list stuck to one of the upright supports inside the back door.
