What is the status of ML?

If ML is not going to be back up in the near future, how about the
status of the tape drive on AI so that I can get back some of the
files on ML that I need?

ML's disk, and thence ML, are again running.

Maybe the easiest plausible thing to do about MD's disk, which looks
pretty beat both electronically and mechanically, is to swap it with
HT's disk, which seems to be OK at first glance.

i tried a few of the simple things alan mentioned. it's the right disk and
the right number plug. as far as i can tell, everything is powered up,
connected correctly (i didn't try tracing the cables), and there hasn't
been a head crash. RESET doesn't help. most of his other suggestions are
beyond my technical capability or my nerve.

so laurel and i have postponed the AI and MC PMs. we figured it won't hurt
to ask d'avolio to look at ML's disk again, since he's probably going to be
here in the morning.

   Ty rolled the other RP06's out the door. Presumably on orders from Tom
   Greene. This happened about a week ago.

Specificly, he rolled them down into the basement, as part of clearing
the floor space that now officially belongs to the Dean's Office.
They're not gone, although I don't know how long their life expectancy
will be down in the flood zone.

    it's clear that ML has -not- run since Provocative Maintenance. for what
    it's worth, i did an incremental immediately before i turned it off, so if
    the pack is trashed we can reconstitute it. but i think you and laurel need
    to decide between you whether to let d'avolio touch AI and MC before fixing
    ML's disk..

I think it would be foolish to let them touch any other machine until ML is
working again.  If the problem doesn't turn out to be something trivial,
someone better get the word to them so they don't screw us further on
Thursday.

But getting them to fix ML may be harder than just telling them that we
can't get it to boot.  They can always blame it on our software, or our
disk pack, or something.  After all, they just did a PM so it must be
working!  When they put us in this situation, we have to be able to tell
them what the problem is (beyond "it won't boot").  Questions that occur to
me:

Is the right unit number plug (0) inserted?  Is everything properly powered
on?  Plugged in?  What happens if you first push the RESET button to reset
the 8080?  It would be awfully embarrassing to make a big scene about not
letting DEC touch AI and MC, and then discover that we mounted the wrong
pack...

You can get the 8080 to tell you exactly what the error was that it
encountered, someone should do that.  (It's in the manual -- I don't
think you have to read the 8080 source code, although we have that to!)  It
might save you a lot of trouble worrying about head crashes if you know
that the 8080 can't even talk to the controller!

Is the pack in the same drive that the processor is cabled up to?
(Sometimes the guys from DEC like to "improve" things.)  The drive that
used to work was the one closer to the door (-not- the one next to the
working processor).

Is there any evidence on the system console that the guys from DEC might
have accidentally used our pack as a scratch pack?

Did D'Avolio actually -say- that the PM was finished?  He really thinks he
left the machine working?  What was the last thing that -he- did (according
to the console paper)?

Could the pack have had a head crash the first time it was mounted after
DEC left?  (Well, has anyone looked?)

Do any other packs boot in ML?  Like an old AI pack #0 that was DUP'ed and
retired.  (Don't try this unless you are certain that it isn't a head
crash.  You only lose another pack but RP06 packs are getting somewhat
rare...)

Does that pack boot in any other machines?  (Don't try that unless you are
-really- certain that it isn't crashed, RP06 heads are precious.)

What happens if you cable up "MD's" drive to ML and try it?  (I think it
works well enough to try some simple experiments.)

   [After glancing through my mail on AI]
   I've got a bad feeling about letting DEC play with AI and MC after breaking
   ML.  Is there any evidence that ML -ever- ran after they did "PM"?

Answering several questions at once:

The RP06 sitting in the middle of what used to be the vax farm (has a
very tiny note from Alan on it about "spindle bearings") is my source
for parts. It has many good heads.

ML seems never to have run after DEC finished. I looked at it briefly
and found nothing glaringly wrong. It gets different error codes every
time you boot it. Maybe DEC realigned the disk heads and they were bad
enough before that the pack is now unreadable. I suppose we could ask
Mike D. about this. I can look at it more, but probably not for a
few days.

Um, weren't there two RP06s in the corner where XX was until quite
recently? Where'd they go?

    Penny tells me that when you try and boot ML it says ?BT 001120.
    Basically, this means that when the very first time the 8080 tries to
    access the disk, it fails.  This means that either the pack is bad or
    the drive is broken.  If DEC screwed up our pack, then they are a bunch
    of boneheads.  If they broke the drive, then they should fix it.  Do
    any of you guys think you can figure out which it is?

I have logged a service call. The log number is BB0093. I just used
AI's system serial number since it seemed from what everyone was
saying that it wasn't a relevant number anyway. They had no problem
swallowing the number and said they would page Mike Divolio right
away. Cheers

They changed to the fourty mile long "system serial numbers" a few
years ago. Older machines kept the old style numbers. I don't think we
ever had system numbers for the three machines that aren't AI. I have
no idea what to tell DEC.

On another topic, we are pretty much out of RP06 panel light bulbs.
Could whoever talks to D'Avolio please ask him to leave (sell..) us a
few zillion? (Actually somewhere around 100 should last till the end of
time..)

    Alan, I'm not sure what's behind all this, but my suspicion is that
    you overestimated the IQ of the people who fed you this line....

It is, of course, very easy to overestimate the IQ of those drones, but let
me tell you the experiments I have performed on them:  

1.  When they ask for the "system serial number" I have told them I have no
idea what it is.  Generally they then ask what "kind" of system it is.
Telling them that it is a KS10 doesn't work here, but telling them it is a
2020 at MIT generally enables them to find us in their records.  (If -I-
then ask -them- what the "system serial number" of the system they just
found is, they claim that they can't tell!)

2.  When they ask for the "system serial number" I have told them it is a
2020 processor with serial number 4xxx (whatever it is).  This does not
work.  They can't find it, and I have to resort to telling them its a 2020
at MIT as in case 1.

3.  When they ask for the "system serial number" I have read them the
multi-digit number that the Field Service person wrote in the space labeled
"system serial number" on the pink form from the previous service call.
That number works.

I can only conclude from this that there is a "system serial number" that
DEC makes up, that isn't written on any equipment, that DEC uses
internally.  If Rob is capable of getting the drones to swallow those
four-digit numbers as "system serial numbers", then he should have been
calling in the KS10 repairs for the last few years -- it would have saved
me a lot of grief.

All I really know about this is that the "system serial number" that
DEC used to want when I placed calls for XX (or the KL I used to work
with at Wesleyan) was the processor serial number (GETAB% .APRID).
The four digit numbers I listed are the kind of thing I'd expect as a
DEC-20's serial number, whatever its CPU type.

When we got BLT, its "system serial number" as inscribed on the front
panel where you're supposed to look when logging a service call
matched the "processor serial number" as written on the parts list
inside the back door of the processor.  It also matched the "serial
number" written into the boot blocks on the disk packs.  That's the
number I would have used to place any service calls on the thing.

Alan, I'm not sure what's behind all this, but my suspicion is that
you overestimated the IQ of the people who fed you this line.  The
thing I always had a hard time with was convincing them that a
DECSYSTEM 2065 or 2020 really isn't some strange kind of VAX; once
they got that straight, they'd transfer me to somebody who understood
the numbering scheme and who was happy with the four digit number.

My guess is that the people who answer the phone for DEC are the ones
who couldn't hold down the job answering phones at BBN for the NOC.
Just play dumb, keep repeating "it's a DECSYSTEM 2020, serial number
4627, and no, it's not a VAX" and they'll eventually figure it out.

It's not the -processor- serial number, but it is (or may be) the -system-
serial number.  I have tried giving DEC processor serial numbers when
logging a service call, and they always insist that that won't do them any
good.  As near as I can tell, the "system serial number" is a magic string
that DEC makes up that collectively applies to all of your equipment (and
isn't written on any of it).  Presumably this is a useful concept if you
have a service contract covering your "system", and is pointless otherwise
-- but DEC still wants it for their paperwork.

The weather station is a good idea, I'll talk to Tom about it.  No
promises, but from noises he's made before he might be interested.

Here are the serial numbers for all five CPUs.  This does not mean
that I expect you to get all of them PM'ed.

	AI:  4627
	ML:  4653
	MC:  4649
	MD:  4648
	BLT: 4380

I don't know what the long alphanumeric string on the punch card on
the front of AI is, but it's not the serial number.  All four ITS
KS-10s have stickers with their serial numbers on the outside of the
back of the processor, just above the door.  Brave Little Toaster (aka
LSD, the one running Twenex) has a sticker on its front panel.
Additionally, all of them have their serial numbers scribbled on a
parts list stuck to one of the upright supports inside the back door.

    I NEED ONE THING!!!!
    I need to log the calls using the system serial numbers. I have the
    one for ai because it is conveinently posted HOWEVER I can't find them
    posted for MC or ML and don't know how to find it. As soon as someone
    tells me what the system serial numbers for MC and ML are I will log
    the calls.

We have -never- known the system serial numbers for any of the machines
other than AI.  I have tried to get system serial numbers from DEC, but
they can never understand why I don't know what they are already.  I have
no idea how they think I am supposed to learn them in the first place!  The
one posted on AI I got from Lester back when we only had AI, and it was
sufficiently hard to get that now, when I log a service call on -any- of
the machines, and DEC insists I give a system serial number, I always just
give them AI's.  I suppose that whatever records DEC keeps on a per-system
basis are hopelessly screwed up for our KS10's.  (In effect I guess we have
one system with four processors.)

Actually, I'm not sure that the number posted on AI is even the one that I
have been using.  You might want to look at the pink customer copies of the
bills for previous repairs that I keep in the bottom drawer of my filing
cabinet (in a folder labeled "MAINT" or something similar), to see what the
number is that I have really been using.

    Rob--Maybe you guys can buy us a nice gift. I think we need a new
    weather station because of Prep's demise. There are probably countless
    other things we need or want. Whatever.

Well, NIKKI can be repaired with only a little effort (new boot-proms, and
a new binary).  MAP and I have been going to get around to doing that for
months...  perhaps when I get back in two weeks...

Rob, thanks for the offer to try and help pay but it sounds
complicated. Let me propose that we proceed this way: I just got a
call from Mike Divolio. He was very nice and said he would come out as
soon as I log a call. I will then make out a wreq for NTE $3700 and
that will cover PM on AI, MC, and ML, their associated disks and the
TU77. While he is here he will check the busted disk on ML, tell me
how much he thinks it will cost to fix, and if I don't think it is too
much I will tell him to go ahead, he will fix it, and I will make out
a wreq for it. Please note that Mike agreed to PM the machines BEFORE
a PO is assigned. This was very nice of him/them.

I NEED ONE THING!!!!

Certainly someone should call DEC and find out how much it will take
to do a PM.  We need a couple different sets of figures:

  How much it will cost to do just the AI ITS machines (two CPUs, a
  tape drive, three RP06s)?

  How much will it cost to do all three (four? five?) KS-10s, AI's
  tape drive, and all of the disks (at least four RP06s, maybe as high
  as seven)?

  How much would it cost for us to just buy the filters and do all the
  work ourselves?

The pricing situation may have changed a lot since the last time we
had this done, and it may be that it will be a considerable net saving
to do the AI and LCS machines all in one visit by DEC (the minimum
number of hours per visit may have gone up).

If you can send this information to us we will talk to Tom Greene and
get back to you Real Soon to tell you if we're in and talk about
scheduling if we are.  Sorry for the roundabout approach, but the LCS
ITS machines don't officially exist, so funding PM for them has to go
by the back door if happens at all....

laurel and i just talked. this is the new improved theory:

she will call dec and attempt to arrange PMs on AI, MC, and ML. she's
aware that MC is nominally LCS property but figures it's mostly used
by AI types and anyway we spend so little on the ITSs, another $1k
isn't going to hurt very much. she will also see about getting ML's
disk fixed; JTW, please remind her of your diagnosis of the problem
with that. i will make sure all the machines are clearly labelled so
dec field circus won't be able to argue that they couldn't figure out
which was which.

also, i will call l&h for details about fixing this power supply
that's been sitting on alan's office floor for 8 months. (or alan, do
you have current info on them?) when we get info, laurel will create
the necessary paperwork here and i will send the power supply off....

alan, is that what we want?

OK, I get boggled by endlessly nested messages and so I haven't really
read these message to carefully. Tell me if this is right:

What we want to do is get PM on AI and the other ITS that is sitting
next to AI. We want filters changed and power supplies checked and
ligtbulbs changed. We want a power supply to get fixed but we are not
going to have DEC do it because it is expensive so you are sending it
to L&H instead. How am I doing so far? We are marginally interested in
seeing the LCS ITS machines serviced but would like LCS to pay for it
since they are supposed to be taking care of those machines. So what I
need to do is this, all-of-this, and nothing--but-this: Call DEC, find
out how much it will cost to do a PM on the two machines, write a PO,
and schedule it. Does this sound right? Let me know and your ever
faithful servant will get right on it.

	As far as heph's chaos software being broken, I don't know enough about 
	chaosnet to say.

    well, it still seems to be broken. the ordinary fix (taught me by mr.
    roylance) is to boot the sucker, but that doesn't help. could you please
    find someone who does know about unix chaosnet stuff and see whether the
    situation can be alleviated? thx..

    ----Can anybody help me with this?----

    -----Curt-----

My guess is that on or about 10/24/89 05:18:39 somebody moved vulcan
from subnet 128.52.22.0 (aka chaos subnet #o26) to subnet 128.52.32.0
(which would be chaos subnet #o40, but there are no chaos bridges to it
so it is not chaos live).  Chaos hosts cannot contact vulcan on subnet
#o26 because it isn't on that piece of wire.

I suspect Vulcan was moved to 128.52.32 to avoid putting NFS traffic
through the Proteon gateway.  (The gateway has problems with NFS
traffic:  it cannot reliably handle a burst of five 1500byte packets
generated in an NFS data transaction.)

Vulcan will be turned off soon, so the move was probably done because
NFS file traffic on Vulcan was broken.  If that is true, then the ITS
machines have lost a path to their most convenient 6250 drive.

The path could be re-established with a chaos gateway to #o40.  Alan
would know how hard that is.

Laurel, i will try to be around at a rational hour on wed. to talk to you
about arranging this.

    No, DEC would charge an arm and a leg to fix MD.  Recall that this is
    the busted power-suppy that's sitting under my desk waiting to be
    mailed off to LH Research, who will fix it for about $400.

    Yes, since we might need to read the recent ML tapes, I think we should
    install it.  (The bug that happened early on, that made me nervous
    about installing it, almost certainly has nothing to do with the new
    code.  (I don't suppose anyone has fixed that in my absence...))

(what, are you kidding?) DUMP 442BIN now installed on AI and MC. Noble,
that means you now can read those ML tapes using AI's drive.

    As far as heph's chaos software being broken, I don't know enough about 
    chaosnet to say.

well, it still seems to be broken. the ordinary fix (taught me by mr.
roylance) is to boot the sucker, but that doesn't help. could you please
find someone who does know about unix chaosnet stuff and see whether the
situation can be alleviated? thx.

You might want to look through my BABYL file for a message I may have saved
from Joe Ricchio about what this costs, etc.  (He arranged it for MC/MD
once long ago, and I may have added some notes when I did it last for
AI/ML.)  I think you set it up the same way you set up a service call, and
I think it's pretty cheap.  I would emphasize that the most important thing

    NGL -- i note that you were trying to read some of the ML tapes onto AI so
    that you could get at your stuff, and appeared to be losing. this was not
    your fault. ML is running a newer version of dump which is not backwards
    compatible.

Right, to be completely clear about this:  Tapes written with the new
version of DUMP (running only on ML since the end of July) are not readable
in older versions of DUMP.  Tapes written with the old DUMP -are- readable
using the new version (I'm not crazy!).  This incompatibility was necessary
so that we could start using certain modern tape drives (such as the one
Symbolics uses).

		alan, i never got around to installing the new dump on AI and
    MC; more exactly, i never got around to deciding it was appropriate/safe/
    sufficiently tested. maybe now's the time to install it?

Yes, since we might need to read the recent ML tapes, I think we should
install it.  (The bug that happened early on, that made me nervous about
installing it, almost certainly has nothing to do with the new code.  (I
don't suppose anyone has fixed that in my absence...))

       talk TCP.  Perhaps the software it runs has changed.  Any chance that
       the new Unix person installed a version of Unix without Chaosnet?

Well, I can tell you that I haven't changed anything that would affect
chaosnet - I haven't installed any "new" versions of unix on any machines
except life, and life is not involved on the chaosnet (that I know of).

In any case, life was just upgraded to run the same os revision as the
rest of the servers (SunOS 4.0.3)

As far as heph's chaos software being broken, I don't know enough about 
chaosnet to say.

       And I'll bet that nobody except Penny has even -looked- at poor ML.  I
       suppose Penny could just call DEC to come and fix it, but we'd look pretty
       silly if the problem turned out to be something totally trivial.  

       (I realize that everybody there with RP06 experience is so busy that they
       can't spare 5 minute to go upstairs to the 9th floor, so I've arranged to
       fly back to Cambridge on November 16 to do it myself.  Of course if
       somebody else gets around to it first, that would be a win.)

    Flame, flame. I've looked at it (because Penny wandered down and yanked,
    I'll admit). It's broken.

    Anybody know what the state of "MD's" RP06 is?

"MD's" RP06 almost works.  It causes ITS to crash about once a day because
the controller complains that the drive has disappeared.

There should be another useable corpse in the RP06 graveyard (assuming you
guys haven't moved anything since I left) that has nothing wrong with it
other than a bad set of spindle bearings.  I believe it is labeled.

i've been using the vulcan (tape) drive to remotely dump MC. today, i
couldn't get MC to connect to it. i tried rebooting Heph, which is the
usual solution. still no luck getting connected. i was fiddling with the
tape drive a little more, when some random grad student (i don't have a
name to attach to him) wandered by and said "gee, is that working?  it's
been dead for a month." this surprised me, as i thought i had used this
drive as recently as monday, so i pressed for details. the GS believed that
a new drive was on order but not arrived yet, and didn't really know much.
a little later, i bumped into Curt (the newish AIL unix weenie) and asked
him. after a careful description of which tape drive i was referring to, he
was pretty sure that the dead drive is some other one which is attached to
a bunch of the newer unix boxes, and didn't know anything about the one i
was losing with.

could you please confirm this analysis? also, any idea what is wrong with
the drive connected to pyggy/heph/etc.? perhaps the bug is that heph's
chaos connection is down -- i can't finger there from AI....

ML's disk seems to have died for no apparent reason. the sysconsole says
something about a massbus err a little after noon tuesday. when i looked at
the disk, the panel switch was on STOP. i write-protected it and pulled out
the number plug and tried to start it, but it wouldn't budge. all the
breakers seem to be on; i tried switching the front one off and then on,
but that didn't help. i tried to take the disk out so i could look for

Hi there.

The computer centre here in University College Dublin are looking for a good
home for a 2020 CPU. I guess anyone who would be prepared to pay shipping costs
would be welcome to it.

Ah, so YOU are the folks who run the KS-OWNERS mailing list?

Maybe you would like us here to do the North American distribution
of the KS-OWNERS mailing list.  A few of us here got the idea to do
this because we didn't know that a KS-related mailing list (with
the exception of KS-ITS) existed.  Perhaps you ought to officially
register your list... it got me a lot more subscribers on PDP8-LOVERS
when I did that...

        Let me know what you want to do...

We anticipate that, due to the small number of people strange enough to
want to have a 36-bit machine at home, this will be a low-volume mailing list.

KS-AT-HOME is intended for people who own, or are interested in someday
owning, a KS-10 (a/k/a DECsystem 2020).

frankly, cstacy's working paper really won't help you much, and it wouldn't
hurt us to let Blythe take it off the shelves (we -will- still have a
master to recopy if we ever really want to). the truth is, cstacy's
incantations for ITS working paper mostly focusses on KAs, with an appendix
of differences for KLs. nothing on KSs. and the main subject of the paper
is basic bringing the machine up and down, for which the model differences
do make a difference. the same material should be covered, probably more
competently and certainly more machine-specific to KSs, in the doc alan
presumably sent along with your ITS tape kit.

you may have heard that ML's disk drive was broken. DEC came last week and
thought they had fixed it, but they were wrong. so mike D'avolio turned up
this week to work on it. he had not finished by the time Alan left today
for vacation. alan said he got the impression from DEC Field Circus on the
phone that the repair PO he generated last week to cover this work might
have been closed before he called to say ML was still broken. he also said
that for some reason, DEC seems to gravitate to talking to you about the
KSs sometimes, even though only half of them are LCS.
    so, if D'Avolio or some other DEC type starts complaining to you that
they have not received the PO for the work on ML this week, please let me
know, and i will arrange to have another repair PO generated. thanks. alan
will be back sometime next week.

If you've been having ?PAR ERR xxx yyy zzz type errors on a KS10, you can
refer to the KS10 hardware manual for the interpretation of those bits.
It should point you precisely at the board that is unhappy.

Another thing to do is the double and triple check the voltages from the
KS10 power supply (the Mighty Mite).  KS's like to run a little bit hot
so err on the side of high (e.g. 5.1) instead of low.

Actualy, this is not about IO instructions, but about power supplies.
I support a commercial KS10 site here in Washington D.C. (DEC doesn't
know how to fix these things any longer, and they admit it frankly)
who has cooked his power supply (H7130C made by LH Research). I 
managed to find him one, but it too was bad; I will receive another 
tomorrow morning and try that out. I need to find LH Research so that 
I can get the bad one fixed to have as a spare. Does anyone out there
know where these people are? I have looked in every reference I have 
and can not find them.

Does anyone know if there is any activity on the idea of building a
modern disk controller for the KS? This is something that I am sure all 
of us would welcome. My RM03s are the worst thing about my 2020. 

Interesting story: the heat pump air handler in my house was replaced 
recently, and when the guys came in to do the work, one a young guy, and 
one an older gentleman, they were a little suprised at the 2020 system 
there, next (roughly) to the air system. To my great suprise, the old 
guy leaned over the console, and logged into F-S !!! I had not changed the 
password (same as the RED pack). Seems he used to work for DEC in field 
circus, and didn't know much about 20s (he knows everything about 8's
though!) but thought (correctly) that he remembered how to log in.

I gave him a PDP8, and a hugh box full of flip-chips. It was really a blast
talking to this guy. Not only did he replace my air handler for the house, 
but he griped about my going so long between filter changes on the RM03s
in such a dirty environment, and proceeded to PM the drives. The young guy
(who was actually the boss) didn't seem too interested in all of this. 
The old guy says he will give me a call when he gets the 8 running (I gave
him a set of RX02s, controller, and a box of floppies too...) I don't 
know why this guy ever retired. I hope I have half that much energy when
I am 68 !!!

Strange things do happen....

Question: Is there some way to put a TOPS-20 on usenet ??

Subject: 2020 s/n 4384 lives



Folks,

     It is with a lot of pleasure, and a lot of smiles, that I can announce
that 2020 s/n 4384, known generaly as Banzai, lives. Many thanks to all
who sent their suggestions and technical information. I now have, thanks
to Mr. Dempster, Volume 1 of the handbook to match my Volume 2. This 
Ridder fellow sent the magical data on the RM03s to make them behave in 
a civil (18bit) way. The machine came up without a hitch once the proper
switches, jumpers, and other things were set. 

     I have it running UETP right now, but without the tape drive which
is the next thing on my list of projects to get running. I have a red pack
which should suffice in the MT debugging, with luck. 

     What now? Well, I hope to start running MRCs Tops-20 for general 
purpose things, and I am looking for any software that I can get for 
the 20, particularly network modeling type stuff. Anybody know of any?

     Longer term, I want to get the Tops-10 and ITS releases set up to 
run, since there is a very good chance that I will be getting another
system to play with, or maybe even the guts of one to experiment on
making it smaller, etc. What is involved with that?

Again, many thanks, and I hope that all of you have a very good season and 
that the new year will be good to you and the people (and machines) that
you love.

Doug

Doug -

     There is no version of TOPS-20 TCP/IP for the 2020.  I may, at
some point, create one; but it'll be a fair amount of work and I'd
want someplace to talk to using my DUP/KDP.  I am absolutely *not*
interested in doing SLIP on a DZ11!  You can assume this is an absolute,
final word on the present status in TOPS-20 land.

     ITS TCP/IP does run on the 2020, but not using the DUP/KDP.

Folks,

I am sending this to both the ks-owners and the ks-its lists mainly because
it seems that there may be people on the ks-its list that are tops-20
folks as well.

The situation is that I have a 2020, and I am interested in putting it
onto the arpanet in some way. There are a bunch of people at the University
of Maryland that will cooperate with me, but I need to figure out what the
available ways are for a 2020 unders some flavor of tops-20 to do this. 
Also, it would be interesting to know how to do it with ITS as well since
I may well be getting a second machine an be able to run both operating
systems. I have the usual KMC/DUP comm hardware. I have not heard a real
final word on what tcp/ip, etc. exists for the 2020 though. Can someone,
or a group of someones, advise and enlighten me?

Many thanks, and wishes for a crazy season to you all.....

Doug

P.S. Peter, no message from you yet on the RM03 wiring changes, and no
     sign of the KS Volume I yet Joe!

2020s running ITS currently support IP/TCP over ACC IMP interfaces and
CHAOSnet over old chaos hardware. All major IP services are supported.
We currently lack domain resolver software, though. Plans are to port
Rob's TOPS-20 resolver to ITS, and integrate it with the ITS mailer.

Ethernet (Interlan NI1010A interface) support for both IP/TCP and
Chaos will exist at some point. I imagine IP/TCP will show up first,
unless the aforementioned subnet 6 dies completely. Also, TCP is
getting some attention to improve its performance in the face of
the current arpanet disaster.

2020s running MIT TOPS20 also support chaosnet, though again only on
old chaos hardware at the moment. All usual chaos services are available.

    Re:   Networks on MIT's 2020

    	Rob, what network are on your 2020s running ITS.  We have been
    	offered a 2020 from TI, but it would be useless unless it could
    	be networked on the campus network.  We would like to run some
    	form of TCP/IP or maybe CHAOSnet.  When it was at TI, it was
    	running DECnet Phase II via a DUP11, I think.  Is there any
    	chance we could connect it to our network?

All four are on MIT subnet 6, one of the last surviving pieces of real
chaos wire here.  MC and AI are also on the Arpanet, via an interface
made by ACC.  Somebody else on KS-ITS might be able to provide more
info, I've never done anything with the low-level network stuff on
ITS.

Well, after many months of delay and other headaches, the 2020 hardware
has been installed in my basement, and AI spent the weekend getting the 
power hooked up, etc. The system has been powered up and the KS10>
prompt obtained. No time yet to get a boot off of the tape or disk. 
I hope that there will not be problems, but no way to be sure yet.
Any advise, etc would be appriciated. Also, it looks like it is time
to talk about getting an ITS boot tape/pack, etc so that a Washington
D.C. ITS can be realised. Interesting typo up there! I meant I, not AI....

    i asked joe ricchio what happened to the boxes of 2020 junk that
    used to live opposite the dover. he said he had carefully moved
    them into the field circus office (936). which is where i found
    them. since they have prints and doc and such, maybe we should put
    at least one set somewhere else?

Well, it's not a bad place for th, so long as it's understood that
those are MIT property, not DEC (ie, they can't vanish without our
permission).  Most of the documentation is actually twenex stuff, not
much is related to KS-10 hardware.  I'm interested in keeping it
around in any case.  I'd just prefer not to have to keep it in my
office.

I am involved peripherally with this project.

There is NO attempt to shortchange or ignore ITS, WAITS, and TENEX.

But!!  We will need *papers* from people in these communities in order to
fairly cover these operating systems.

Otherwise, I will write up something really brief.  For ITS, in a few short
paragraphs I'll talk about DDT as the command decoder, PCLSR'ing, and the
environment that led to the creation of EMACS.

I think such coverage WOULD shortchange ITS.  There are lots of important
concepts that can and should be discussed in detail -- PCLSR'ing, ITS virtual
memory (not as good as TOPS-20/Tenex, but quite advanced for its time),
canonical terminals/SUPDUP/CRTSTY, symbolic system calls, CHEOPS, Knight TV
system, ...

TECO and TECO-based editors should be a paper in itself.

The following message was forwarded to me (it was originally sent to AIList
I think) with the suggestion that I should redistribute it to whatever
mailing lists of PDP-10 hackers I knew of.  I don't know anything more
about this than what is revealed here.

It does kind of sound like these guys are planning on writing a history of
PDP-10's that only mentions TOPS10 and TOPS20 and fails to consider ITS and
WAITS and perhaps shortchanges TENEX.  But I suspect that this is merely a
shortcoming of this announcement.

Subject: Announcement of the DEC 10 and PDP-6 history project (PROJECT-10262)

This message originates from 2 sources:

	Les Earnest
	Computer Science Department
	STANFORD UNIVERSITY
	Stanford, CA  94305
	415.723.9729
	ARPA: LES@SAIL.STANFORD.EDU

	Cherry Hill, NJ  08002
	609.665.8711
	ARPA: DEMPSTER@MARLBORO.DEC.COM (MARKET)

The goal of this project is to publish an analysis and history of
the evolution, implementation and use of Digital's 36 bit systems.
This period began with the PDP-6 in 1964 and continues today with
TOPS 10/20 development, which is scheduled to end in 1988.

We are working aggressively to finish the project, and have it
published, by March/April 1988.  This will require that the
completed manuscript be ready to go into the publication cycle
by August 1987!

The project will attempt to answer the following questions:

	1. In what markets/applications were these systems used?

	2. Who were the users of these systems and what impact did
	   roughly 2,500 TOPS 10/20 systems have on their organizations?

	3. Who were the principle system architects of these systems?
	   What features, and if there had been sufficient time to
	   implement them, would have significantly improved the
	   architecture?

	4. What impact did the decision to continue to examine design
	   extensions to the architecture have on the usefulness and
	   acceptability of these systems.  This is in contrast to a
	   more common practice today to work from a detailed design
	   specification, sometimes dated, building follow-on systems
	   which provide increased performance through the use of new
	   component technologies and packaging techniques.

	5. What part of the overall design (TOPS10/20) was technology
	   dependent and what can still be considered "unequaled" in
	   relation to other computer architectures still undergoing
	   active development?

	6. What type of development environment (both HW and SW)
	   supported and contributed to the evolution of 36 bit
	   systems?

	7. What influence did TOPS 10/20 have on other vendors system
	   development?

This history will undoubtedly be assembled from many sources and
participants.  Some information will be anecdotal; there will be
interviews with the people involved (users and developers) and technical
papers will be solicited.  Of course there will also be the packaging
and assembly of facts as we see them.

The result will hopefully have sufficient depth to serve as:

	1. An introductory or advanced text on system design and
	   hardware/system software implementation.

	2. A analysis of the success and difficulties of marketing
	   complex systems into a very crowded market of competing
	   alternatives.

	3. A catharsis for those of us who have contributed to the
	   development and use these systems and who will now move
	   onto new computing architectures and opportunities.

In addition to interviewing directly 25-50 developers, users and
product managers we will continue to work to identify contributors
and significant events up to when the final draft is submitted to
the publisher.  Two "topics" are already under development:

	1. Rob Gingell from SUN is working on a paper which looks
	   at extensions to TOPS 20 which would have enhanced its
	   capabilities.

	2. Frank da Cruz and Columbia are summarizing 10 years of
	   experience and development of TOPS 20 systems.  Some
	   effort will also be made to detail the process which
	   lead to their selection of a follow-on architecture to
	   TOPS 20.

There is a need to develop additional topics which represent the
use and application of the technology (TOPS 10/20) in other areas.
Specific recommendations are welcome as are proposals to develop
them.  A short abstract should accompany any such proposal.  Every
effort will be made to work with individuals or organizations
interested in making such a contribution.

There will be a standalone (no network connections) DECSYSTEM 2020
(YIPYIP) dedicated to supporting the project.  This system has a 3
line hunt group, with all lines accessible from a single number
(201.874.8612).

Both YIPYIP and MARKET will have "public" directories for remote
login (<log>DEMPSTER.PROJECT-10262 <Password>LCGLCG).  MARKET can
be accessed by modem (617.467.7437), however disk quota is limited.
MARKET's primary purpose <DEMPSTER.PROJECT-10262> is ARPAnet TELNET
access.  YIPYIP is a dedicated PROJECT-10262 system.  MAIL can also
be sent to DEMPSTER on either system.

YIPYIP and MARKET will keep a running summary of ideas and comments
up on Columbia's BBOARD software.  KERMIT also runs on each system
for uploads.

SAIL.STANFORD.EDU will support ARPAnet transfers to a "public" area:

	FTP<ret>
	CONNECT SAIL.STANFORD.EDU<ret>
	SEND AFN.EXT<ret>
	DSK: AFN.EXT [PUB,LES]<ret>

SAIL runs WAITS, an operating system similiar to TOPS 10.  File
names are limited to 6 characters and extensions limited to 3.


Implementation details:

	1. User input is welcomed and desired from all application
	   and geographic areas.

	2. Input from past and present developers is also desired.

	3. Throughout the project a secondary goal will be to build
	   a list of users/locations (installation date, duration and
	   disposition) of PDP-6 and KA, KI, KL and KS systems.
	   Serial numbers, if available, are requested.

	4. We anticipate that this project will generate a large
	   volume of information (which we hope will arrive
	   electronically).  Some information, for any number of
	   reasons, may not be in line with the project's stated
	   goals.  Therefore, all notes, interview material and
	   submissions will be donated to the Computer Museum in Boston
	   at the the completion of the project to be available for
	   future reference and research.

Ideas, contributions, suggestions and criticism are welcome.  As these
36 bit systems were the products of a multitude of people, so too
will be the writing of their history.
