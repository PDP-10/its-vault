i called lh research. 714-730-0162 works. fortunately CJL was able to
explain the new imrpoved method of making long-distance phone calls (4
followed by acct # to be charged, which is equiv to 9- for ordinary outside
calls).

they say repair of MD's power supply will cost $579. neither they nor i was
sure whether we have an account set up with them already; if we don't, they
will have to do that and it will take marginally longer.  if we can fax
them a copy of the PO, they will set up their acct for us while the power
supply is in transit. their fax # is 7146692544, Attn: Tri Nguyen (fellow i
spoke to). PO should include a reference to their Return Material
Authorization # 178484. i gave laurel c/o standard lab address as the
shipping and billing address for them to use; if this is wrong, please
correct it in the PO. (alan, should it have your name on it instead?)

their address is LH Research Inc.
		 14402 Franklin Ave.
		 Tustin, CA 92680
		 Attn: Repair Service

(i've never heard of Tustin, CA, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.)
if we can't fax them a copy of the PO, i guess we just send it along with
the power supply and wait the extra fraction of time for them to go through
their paperwork gyrations.
