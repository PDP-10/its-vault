2Figure 10: A typical reflectance map for a surface, with both a glossy
and a matte component of reflection, illuminated by a point source.
The coordinates are surface slope in the x and y directions,
and the curves shown are contours of constant scene radiance.

2FIGURE 2a0: Undulations in a specularly reflecting surface causing
scattering of incident rays into a variety of directions.  
The surface will not appear specular if it is imaged on a scale
where the surface undulations are not resolved.  It may instead
have a glossy appearance.

causecident rays to be scattered into a variety of directions
upon reflection.  This kind of surface micro-structure gives
rise to matte reflection.
