.appnd(Error Messages)

This section is not intended to be a complete list of all MACSYMA's
error messages.  It is merely intended to describe in general error
messages which are most likely to be encountered by the user, help
him identify their source, and indicate ways to remedy the situation.

The first thing to do with an error message is to identify which
program is sending the message.  Since MACSYMA runs in a Lisp system,
which in turn is running in an operating system, there are three possible
sources for an error message:  the operating system, Lisp, and MACSYMA.

As a general rule of thumb, on ITS, an error message from MACSYMA will
be in English.  It may be cryptic, but it will be an English sentence.
An error message from the system (otherwise known as DDT (the name of the
monitor) or ITS (our operating system)) will have mostly numbers in it.
The other clear identifier of an error message from the system is that you
will be at DDT level and no longer in MACSYMA.  An error message which
begins with a ";" on a line is an error from the Lisp system under MACSYMA.
