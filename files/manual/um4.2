In this chapter we shall discuss algebraic operations in MACSYMA.  
There are a number of dichotomies which naturally suggest themselves.

    commutative vs. noncommutative
        polynomial algebra   vs.  matrices,dot,&
    symbolic vs. numerical
        ideal theory, invariant theory  vs.  finite elements
    polynomial vs. rational vs. power series
        perturbation theory as an example of...

    real  vs.  complex vs. algebraic

    "free" vs. "constrained by generators and relations"
          Hirota calculus,nonlinear equations
        
    solvable word problem  vs.  no

    program vs. scratchpad
    "mathematical" vs. "non-mathematical"
    (specific vs.  general)


(the latter is a distinction between operations which represent specific
algorithms closely related to a particular domain, such as number theory or ideal theory in commutative rings,  and those operations which apply superficially to most MACSYMA expressions.)

We first restrict ourselves to the more familiar commutative setting.


Probably the sharpest dichotomy is drawn between
One can profitably distinguish between commutative and noncommutative
