    A is not an integer ,so I will use a local declaration to satisfy
    logcontract.

    Fine.  There is a reason MACSYMA is so obstinate.  It is not fair 
    game to have LOGCONTRACT introduce singularities that are not 
    present in the input.  E.g.  1/2*LOG(X) has only a log singularity, 
    but LOG(SQRT(X)) also has a sqrt singularity.  Also, where would 
    one draw the line?  Should LOGCONTRACT(A*B*C*LOG(X)); give 
    LOG(X^(A*B*C)) no matter what A,B,C are?
I see what you mean. It is the old problem of the difference between a formal
command, and a methematicaly valid transformation. I thought of course that 
logcontract was one of macsymas formal commands. It doesn't say anything about
integer declarations for it in the manual, so this must have been a feature added
since then. I'll send a copy of this to Ellen so that it can be put in the new
manual.  


 LOGCONTRACT(N*log(x))---->log(x^n) if and only if n is declared integer.

One thing that should appear with each function in the manual is a list of three
percentages, [ % formalistic, % mathematically meaningfull, % totally crockish ].
But seriously folks, you know that it is hard to get a feel for these things, for
the user to gain confidence in his knowledge of the system enough to be able to
predict what a command will do. I have a good suggestion. A MACSYMA WALL CHART,
giving function names associated switches that affect properties of action,
it should be cleverly layed out, maybe a tree structure on the types of things one
does in macsyma. There should be a short-hand that gives the most useful information
in the shortest time. That genre of handly foldout cards that contain finger-tip
information is also something to look in to.  
It could be the center-fold of the procedings. All we need to do is get together
a few people that know macsyma well (collectivley) and put them in a room with
a large sheet of paper and some crayons, I'll bring them by tonight after the movie.
 
SK@MIT-MC 06/24/79 05:14:24 Re: macsyma manual update
the stuff about plot2 and the xgp needs updating.  if the spooler fails
and you have to do things manually,

	1) you dont have to copy the file to ai
	2) the file gets put in .temp.
	3) you should use :glp <file> /output:xgp

    Are all these messages in a file somewhere?  I don't really want to
    be on the mailing list, but would like to be able to peruse them from
    time to time.
Yes,on ELL;ODE INFO

  Also, at what point and in what way should all this be documented 
in the manual?

I would think "soon", maybe "now". I was trying to decipher how to
include something in DESCRIBE() but didn't have any luck. If you get
me started I may be able to help with the manual stuff. The DESCRIBE
facility would be useful because of the flags, variables and other
such things that a user should know.

I forgot to mention the best first source for text is SHARE;ODE USAGE.
This was written with some attempt to be clear and for a general
audience.....I was thinking of a paper at the time. 

It doesn't have all the latest goodies, but I have fixed it for most 
of them.

MIKE@MIT-MC 08/02/79 22:48:00 Re: Manual
I just found out that BOTTOMUP is a (and the only) valid 3rd argument to
SCANMAP which is normally a two-argument function. This is as far as I can
tell not mentioned in the current manual and should be put in the next one.

To: (BUG MANUAL) at MIT-MC
The DESCRIBE command does not give enough information about SAVE and
STORE for one to figure out how to tell macsyma to save things in
a file of one's own choosing, nor how to save ARRAYS, etc.
This is obviously not a bug in the manual, but in th way describe
references the section of the manual having to do with this.


MIKE@MIT-MC 07/20/79 19:01:21 Re: A suggestion for the next manual
How about having at least 2 indices (indexes?), one for function names with
arguments (like the way thhe current index for the manual is set up) and a
separate index for variables (flags, global lists, etc.). Maybe even a topic
index (of course the contents might just as well do) but certainly at the least
the first two would be extremely helpful in my opinion. (The second would give
the initial values of the variables, again as is currently done in the manual's
index).

Also, it might be nice to have somewhere, maybe not in the manual, but at least
online or as something easily available, something telling about the repre-
sentation of Macsyma objects in MacLisp like Fateman's paper as a good example.

Que' dicele?

LPH@MIT-MC 07/25/79 10:33:02
the statement on page 74 of the manual that says
integrate will automatically apply risch if given these cases
neglects to mention that 1) integrate, defint, ldefint all load
up tremendous amounts of fasl files, including risch if needed,
and can run out of core while loading useless files after
extravagant lengths of time... 2) can risch be put in a syntax
like risch(function,var,lo,hi)? 3) some integrals can be done
in 10 secs with risch and limit that integrate,defint,ldefint
run out of core on after 100 seconds...perhaps some discussion
of such points could be made in the new manual...
