MACSYMA (Project MAC's SYmbolic MAnipulation System) is a
large computer programming system written in LISP used for
performing symbolic as well as numerical mathematical manipulations.
With MACSYMA the user can differentiate, integrate, take limits,
solve systems of linear or polynomial equations, factor polynomials,
expand functions in Laurent or Taylor series, solve differential
equations (using direct or transform methods), compute Poisson series,
plot curves, and manipulate matrices and tensors. MACSYMA has a
language similar to ALGOL-60 to permit the user to write his own
programs for transforming symbolic expressions.

This manual is intended to be a complete reference for the principal
features of MACSYMA as of January 1983.  It is not
meant to be a tutorial nor does it discuss all of the issues involved
in the efficient manipulation of algebraic expressions.

It should be noted that this is a first printing.
The revision of version 9 had been put off too long, so while this
version 10 is substantially correct and complete, many refinements
will be necessary.  A second printing is anticipated within the
next year.
