-------------

General comments:
  Shouldn't all occurrences of "**" be updated to "^"?
   -asb
  In examples, the group macro should be used to bind together not only
   multiple-line Dlines, but the associated C-line as well.  This would
   improve the appearance of examples that are now being broken up.
   For example, see bottom of pages 2-14, 2-18, 6-77, or p 6-58. -asb
  In the general format of a function description, the parens around
    the args of the function are italicized.  They might look better not.

Table of contents page v
  Some overstriking near the bottom:  not enough room for section number.
  Also on the line for HIDE3D.
  Some of the ". . . . . . "'s extend underneath the names.

Chapter 2:
__________

2-2:  In the second paragraph there is a reference to "Appendix II".
This is now Appendix III.  It was II in version 9.  Perhaps it would
be best to tag the appendix and reference the tag, as is done with sections.
Meanwhile I changed the II to III.


2-4:  Table at top of page has some entries that are abbreviated and
some entries that share lines.  If they did not share lines, there would
be no need to abbreviate.  It would also look nicer.
Double factorial should have its own line and its own name.

2-4:  Before explaining EXPT and NCEXPT, might insert something like:
---
The following two forms are sometimes used in the display of large
exponential expressions when the usual two dimensional display becomes
unweildy.
---
Then the EXPT and NCEXPT entries can be changed to:
---
$fun<EXPT> is sometimes used to display ordinary exponentiation.
If there is not enough room for the usual display
A^B, it will appear as EXPT(A,B).

$fun<NCEXPT> is sometimes used to display non-commutative exponentiation.
If there is not enough room for the usual display
A^B, it will appear as NCEXPT(A,B).

2-5:  The footnote regarding the use of square brackets is unnecessary
in the SCRIBE version and should be deleted.

2-6:  The description of lexpr definition:
An example that is used runs a "wrong number arg" test that is not
really necessary.  A possible repair:

MYMAX(A,[L]):= IF L=[] THEN A ELSE APPLY('MAX,CONS(A,L))$

One possible shortcoming of this alternative example is that it is
totally unnecessary since MAX does the same thing.  Perhaps a new
example should be found?

2-7: There is an occurrence of "ith" which should have its th elevated.

2-8:  Top of page:  A sentence of introduction would be good:

Another way to create arrays is provided by MAKE_ARRAY.

2-8:  There should be a line of whitespace after the MAKE_ARRAY description.

2-8:  In the general discussion of assignment of array elements, it might
be useful to add "(if one has been defined)" after "associated function".

2-8: I'm not sure we want to keep the following paragraph:

In order to use a subscripted variable as a single entity without it
being an array and without ever assigning a value to it, it should be
prefixed by an apostrophe to avoid it being confused with a non-subscripted
variable of the same name.  For example SUBST(0,W,W+'W[0]).

The question I have is connected with the quoting.  The comment in the
paragraph does not adequately explain what is going on.  It may be that this
section was written before OPSUBST was added?

2-9:  Above (C1) there should be a word or two of introduction to the
example, such as:

The use of array functions is illustrated in the example below.  The
function A initially computes the factorial.  The effect of changing
the definition of an array function is illustrated in line (C5) through (D6).


Immediately following the example, there is a sentence enclosed in parens.
The parens should be deleted.

2-10:  "The subscripts, which are not
evaluated at definition time, must be either all numeric or all symbolic. "

I do not believe that this is true.

2-17:  Clean up the table: remove double quotes, space out correctly, etc.

2-23:  Need a line of whitespace below the centered FROM illustration.

Chapter 3:

3-2:  Top of page.

This is meant to be a warning, but it is not emphatic enough.  An example
would be good.  e.g., RAT(X^50!) or something.

Chapter 4:

4-3:  Instead of:
The user may have to reset it in DDT with :TCTYP as well.  See [Lew1].

Propose:

On some operating systems, it may also be necessary to reset it at
the system level.  See [Lew1].

4-3:  7th pgph, 2nd sntc:  The file name description is specific to ITS
and will need to be generalized for other systems.

4-3:  7th pgph, 4th sntc:  can also be compiled lisp code.

4-4:  The discussion of setup_autoload contains a mysterious reference
to J0 etc. which is probably a relic of the place from which this text was
taken.  This reference should be deleted.  There should also be a pointer
to the setup_autoload function description.  Also there is some ITSiness
in the description, and unnecessary detail.

propose:

Also: $fun<SETUP_AUTOLOAD> (see $ref<phints>)
can be used to provide automatic loading of
function definitions that are stored in disk files.
You can then use those functions
directly without explicitly loading the files that contain them.


Chapter 5:

Changed copyright to 83 in version 38

5-5:  The default value of %PHI is typed in here as well as on page 1.
It would be better to do it in only one place and create a tag.   This
should be done for SCRIBE version.

5-6:  "ZETA(N) giving" should be " the reduction of ZETA(N) to".
Also the "coeff" should be given explicitly.  It Is:
zeta(2*n)=bern(2*n)*4^(n-1)*%PI^(2*n)*(-1)^(n+1)*(2*n)^N/((2*n-1)!*(2*n+1))

5-9:  The definition of LI[1] is broken on the page.

Chapter 6:

General comments:

 [1] There were several tabs in RMCH6A 126.  Untabified.

6-1:  Another "default value in brackets" that needs to be changed for
      the SCRIBE version.

6-3:  Top of page, parallel sustitution explanation conflicts with
      the one on 6-2.

6-5:  It would be better to keep (C1) of the RATEXPAND example together
with the rest of the example. (no page break).

6-8:  (c4),(d4) are indented.

6-10: (c5)->(d8) are not really necessary.

6-12:  The DISTRIB examples should be in example format.

6-14:  "rational integers" should be deleted from GCFACTOR entry.

6-15:
macro calls are in upper case in FACTORSUM.  Does this matter?  Will it
be ok for RZ's program?

6-16:  In the description of nthroot there is a "nth" THat should have
its "th" elevated, and probably the n should be italic.

6-17:  The ROOTCON table has a column heading that is too wide.

6-17:  The first line of text below the ROOTCON table is unnecessarily
parenned.

6-24:  Top of page, the "U  T" belong as subscripts in the example of
the previous page.  

6-28:  MACSYMA does not behave as suggested by the CHANGEVAR example.
First, the display in d1 is not regulation.  It appears to have been
edited incorrectly.  Also, in executing D2, Macsyma would want to
know about the sign of A.  I ran off this example again, and here is a
transcript.  Perhaps it should replace what is there now.

(C1) ASSUME(A>0);
(D1) 			     [A > 0]

(C2) 'INTEGRATE(%E^SQRT(A*Y),Y,0,4);
		      4
		     /
		     [	  SQRT(A) SQRT(Y)
(D2) 		     I  %E		  dY
		     ]
		     /
		      0

(C3) CHANGEVAR(D2,Y-Z^2/A,Z,Y);
		      0
		     /
		     [		      ABS(Z)
		   2 I		  Z %E	     dZ
		     ]
		     /
		      - 2 SQRT(A)
(D3) 		 - ----------------------------
				A



6-29: The default value of %PHI has a spurious vertical bar. 

6-29: l'Hospital is misspelled.  The leading l should be lower
cased,(fixed) and there should be a circumflex over the o. 

6-31: The bessel equation should be in display format.

6-32: The line labels skip several numbers from the previous page.

6-37: I spotted a definition for APPLY_NOUNS on page 6-37 that appears
to be wrong in that it says EV(EXP,NOUNS) is the same thing as
APPLY_NOUNS(EXP). For example:
EXP:DIFF(A^2,A);
A:2;
APPLY_NOUNS(EXP);
EV(EXP,NOUNS);
In fact, APPLY_NOUNS avoids evaluation and thus does not use the value of A,
while EV causes A to be evaluated and the DIFF call to respond with the
appropriate error message. Please check to see the manual has a more
consistent definition in the next version. 

in the DPART description, add "does when INFLAG is FALSE" after
"PART".

6-41:  The SUBLIS entry has:
  SUBLIS will preserve sharing where possible. eg, SUBLIS([A=B],C+D);
  returns a pointer to the original C+D since no substitution is needed.
  SUBLIS does substitutions in parallel. eg, SUBLIS([A=B,B=A],SIN(A)+COS(B)); 
  returns SIN(B)+COS(A).
  SUBLIS will preserve CRE form, too. eg, ....
One problem with the above is that SUBST([A=B],C+D) behaves the same way,
so this is not a good example.
Proposal:

SUBLIS preserves sharing where possible.  For example, if the common
subexpressions C+D in A:[C+D, C+D] are physically shared in memory,
then SUBLIS([C=B],A) returns [B+D, B+D] with sharing between
the common subexpressions B+D.  This differs from the behavior of SUBST,
which makes no attempt to preserve sharing.
SUBLIS also does
substitutions in parallel, so SUBLIS([A=B,B=A],SIN(A)+COS(B)); 
returns SIN(B)+COS(A).  Contrast this with the behavior of SUBST, which
returns SIN(A)+COS(A).
Unlike SUBST, SUBLIS preserves CRE form, too.

6-48:
In line with my previous suggestion for PICKAPART, and for exactly
the same reasons, I would like to suggest that the REVEAL example be changed
to:
(C1) EXP:(A+B)/2+SIN(X^2)/3-LOG(1+SQRT(X+1));
					  2
				     SIN(X )   B + A
(D1) 	    - LOG(SQRT(X + 1) + 1) + ------- + -----
					3	 2

(C2) REVEAL(%,2);
(D2) 		  Negterm + Quotient + Quotient

(C3) REVEAL(D1,3);
			      SIN   Sum(2)
(D3) 		      - LOG + --- + ------
			       3      2

Same reasons as PICKAPART, see ASB;MDOC FIXED and look for the string
PICKAPART.

6-69:  The second pgph implies that [rat(x^2)] might be automatically
converted.  It isn't, but I don't think it should be either, since lists
of CREs can be useful.  Perhaps an explicit exception for automatic
conversion of lists should be added.

6-71:  NUM and DENOM and the sentence just below appear also on 6-49.
Either this instance or the one on 6-49 should be removed.

6-72:  The FASTTIMES entry does not explain that the polynomials
must be in CRE form and have equal varlists.

6-75: The table in the M1PBRANCH entry should have been kept together
with no page break permitted.  In fact, since there is very little text in the
entry, it is possible that the whole thing should be kept together, no page
break.

6-82:  There are some ITS filenames in pgph 2.

6-83: There should be no page break after the heading
"Multivariate Taylor Series Expansions."  It seems to me that page
breaks should never be permitted after a heading.  Perhaps this is
a bug in the macro for this kind of heading?

6-85: Under the TAYLOR entry that explains ASYMP, the "-ord)" should be
exponentiated.

6-88 thru 6-91:  These pages contain a sequential set of examples that
contain a few glitches:
[1]  Line 3 (C3, D3) is missing (possibly it once existed?).  If there is
no longer a line 3, all subsequent lines should be renumbered to reflect
this.
[2]  Line 5 at the top of page 6-89 contains a declaration for J.  J is not
needed, so this declaration should be deleted.
[3]  The latest version of MANUAL;RMCH6B > has had the references to TRIGSUM
deleted, but the line numbers of the example have only been partially updated.

6-93:  The form returned by ILT has
changed a bit.  So line D4 should now read:

		     SQRT(A B (A B - 1)) T
	      2 COSH(---------------------)	  2
			       B	       A T
(D4) F(T) = - ----------------------------- + -------
		    3  2      2		      A B - 1
		   A  B  - 2 A  B + A

						      2
					    + ------------------
					       3  2	 2
					      A  B  - 2 A  B + A
Also, the D3[1] in line C4 should read just D3.

6-94: the info on LAPINT is all wrong, I think. The file
is SHARE;SPECFN FASL, and the function in that file is SPECINT(expr,ovar)
which requires that expr contain an explicit EXP(-nvar*ovar) as well as
anything else that can be handled by ELL's HYPERGEOMETRIC files.
the example on the bottom line runs over to the next page in a confusing way.

Also, the filename is ITS-specific.

6-94:  There is a broken display at the bottom.

6-95:  The LAPINT example should be redone.  See ASB;MQUERY 180.
First, something must be done about sign of P.  The example asks
about the sign of P, but in general P is the transformation variable,
so it should be allowed to be complex.  Without looking into the 
mathematics a bit more carefully, it seems to me that the question
should not be asked.  Next, the LOAD has to be added at the beginning
of the demo.  Also the line D6 contains a FALSE when you run the demo
now at mc (4-20-83).  Many of the forms now returned are slightly
different from what appears in the manual.

6-96:  There is a th that should be elevated in BERNPOLY.

Chapter 7:

7-4:  The DOMAIN entry might mention M1PBRANCH.  Instead of:

$var<DOMAIN/REAL> - if set to COMPLEX, SQRT(X^2) will remain
SQRT(X^2) instead of returning ABS(X).  The notion of a "domain" of
simplification is still in its infancy, and controls little more than
this at the moment.


Propose:

$var<DOMAIN/REAL> - if set to COMPLEX, SQRT(X^2) will remain
SQRT(X^2) instead of returning ABS(X).
The setting of DOMAIN also changes the effects of M1PBRANCH.
The notion of a "domain"  of simplification
in MACSYMA is still in its infancy.

7-6:  The use of FACTS in (C4) is not described in the FACTS entry.

Chapter 8:


Chapter 9:

9-4: and 10-7 REMRULE example and info are not adequate in my opinion.
REMRULE(simpexpt,"^RULE1"); gives the error: "^RULE1" - no such rule.
this actually means that there is no rule by that name for simpexpt.
it is exceptionally non-obvious that the user should have to type in
REMRULE("^","^RULE1"); in the example because "^" is never returned in
any way by using TELLSIMP, while simpexpt is.

9-9:  Lines C1 and D1 probably should be C6 and D6.

Chapter 10:

10-1:  BREAK, DEBUG, DEBUGPRINTMODE, all appear elsewhere in more complete
forms.  Either they should be deleted here or pointers should be added to
these entries.
BREAK: 10-17,  DEBUG: 15-7, DEBUGPRINTMODE: 15-8.

Chapter 15

General comments:
 [1] Copyright notice updated at RMCH15 27

Appendix II

General comments:
 [1]  I am assuming that this document comes from MANUAL;NVAX >.
      Possibly it should be renamed?

II-5:
In the font switching in the first paragraph of section II.8, there is a
switch to font 3 that is followed by a return to font 2.  The return should
probably be to font 1.  This is what causes the burst of italic in this
section.


Appendix VII

VII-1:  The reference to Appendix II should be Appendix III.  I have
made this change, but it should be changed to a tag when the Appendices
are tagged.
