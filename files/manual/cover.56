This manual maintains the format of Version Nine but contains
corrections and updates.  It corresponds to Version 302 of MACSYMA
which has approximately 242,000 words of compiled code.  Any comments,
suggestions, or criticisms are welcome and should be addressed to:

It should be noted that this is a first printing.
The revision of version 9 had been put off too long, so while this
version 10 is substantially correct and complete, many refinements
will be necessary.  A second printing is anticipated within the
next year.  In particular, readers will note that within the text
subscripts are indicated with square brackets, e.g. "X sub i" is
X[i]; and superscripts are indicated with an uparrow, ^ and parentheses
where appropriate, e.g. X^2 or X^(1/2).  This is due to some problems
with the output device which would have delayed this manual even
longer had we waited for the appropriate fixes.  These problems will
be fixed in the next printing.

This manual was written by Richard Bogen with contributions by Jeffrey
Golden (editor, storage management, debugging, and batch chapters),
Michael Genesereth (relational data base, appendix on the grammar),
Richard Pavelle and Michael Wester (Tensor Manipulation), Richard
Fateman (Appendix for Vaxima), and Alexander Doohovskoy.  We are
extremely grateful to Pitts Jarvis for the many hours he spent in
designing the format for the PUB program to use the Xerox Graphics
Printer, to Howard Cannon for his assistance in arranging for XGP
format to print on an LGP, and to David Goodine who patiently ran
all the examples in the manual to check their accuracy.
