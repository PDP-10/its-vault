manual errata*
p. 0 acknowledgement should be ERDA?
p. 2 2nd paragraph.  why not used an example without ^ in it?
  also logout via logout()$
p. 104-106 fix page numbers (typface)
p 114"TIME=" ==> "TOTALTIME="
p 133 page number (typeface)
p184 why use linsolve instead of solve (p .185,186 also).  the example on p 186 is especially bad since it is 1 equation!
I think the function index and variables index  should be combined.
