Addendum to the Mathlab/MIT MACSYMA Reference Manual
for VAX/UNIX "VAXIMA"  

Facilities of Macsyma will work as they do
on the ITS/PDP-10 MIT-MC system
with the exception of items mentioned here.  Some of
the differences represent extensions or restrictions
reflecting the features available in the current VAX/UNIX operating system.
We have tried to list differences in the order in which the user
is most likely to need the information, not in terms of "importance."


@Section[Getting started]
@Label[gs]

The program is named @t[vaxima] and it may be invoked via a full path
name at Berkeley by @t[/usr/local/vaxima].  (For brevity, the VAX UNIX
Macsyma system will occasionally be referred to as "vaxima".)

You should provide an environment specification which indicates the
home directory for the Macsyma system on your installed system.
For example, on "kim" (Kim No-Vax, our Berkeley vaxima development system), the most up-to-date system is installed 
in @t[/xper/mac/].  My .login file, contains the line
@Begin[Example]
setenv VAXIMA /xper/mac
@End[Example]
This will work if your system (which was delivered on a magnetic tape)
was read into a directory whose name is "/xper/mac".  This environment
name is consulted to find "auto-loading" files, the "describe" database,
"share" directory files, and other useful information.
(If you use the "Bourne Shell" rather than the "C shell," your .profile
file should contain "@t[VAXIMA=/xper/mac]" .)

In general, commands and output are in lower case.

The command line must be followed by a ; or a  , and
THEN a <@i[return]>. Similarly, for ^K ^L <@i[esc]> ?? and other
such Macsyma line-oriented control characters: these must be followed
by a <@i[return]> to take effect. The edit escape, <@i[esc]> <@i[return]>
will put you in a text editor (the default is the screen-oriented editor VI).
If you wish to use another editor, change the value of the macsyma
variable @t[editorcom] to an appropriate string.  For example, to
use "emacs", do @t[editorcom:"emacs vaxima.buf";]

It is possible to use the "teco-like" MACSYMA editor described in Chapter 11
of the manual.
Normally, systems intended for use on VMS will be
delivered with this "teco-like" editor enabled.

For the curious, it is assumed that this option would
be used only in VMS systems, and so the "forvms" status flag is
checked. There is a (sstatus feature forvms)
in @t[mdoit.l] which is normally commented out but which should be uncommented
when building a vms vaxima. The effect of this
is to change the definition of the lisp function "@t[edit*]" and substitute
the file @t[jpg/medit.o] for @t[jpg/newedit.o].

To leave the editor and return to Macsyma with the corrected line,
type @t[:wq] <@i[return]>.   (To edit a command typed earlier, use the edit function, which
will turn its argument into a string and hand it to VI.
This functionality is in general a bit different from the one at MIT. Try it.)

@Section[File Names]
@Label[fn]

The commands @t[loadfile, save, writefile, batch] and the newer
@t[load] take a
simpler file description.  The file name
is not of the form described in the MIT manual,
namely [<@i[6letters]>, <@i[6letters]>, @t[dsk], <@i[6letters]>]
(e.g. [@t[foo,bar,dsk,share]] )  but a simple atomic name,
(e.g. foobar).  It is possible to use more complicated file
names, such as "@t[../foo/bar.longname]"  but then the double-quotes
are required. @t[Closefile] requires no argument, but assumes the file
name given in the previous @t[writefile] is to be closed.
The command @t[load] will ordinarily search
for files in the appropriate "share" directory. File suffixes
".l" for lisp, ".o" for object, ".v" for "vaxima source" are useful
but optional.  Load will use "batch" if appropriate.
Only the simple form of @t[batch( filename)] is provided.
We have not converted STORE or FASSAVE to the VAX,
since it seems somewhat less important with the larger
virtual memory.  

@Section[|Translation and Compilation of Macsyma-level code|]
@Label[tcmlc]

These facilities are in a transitional stage.  We have not tried to
maintain compatibility with recent changes.  It is quite possible to
link to other languages, making certain uses of these facilities
unnecessary.

@Section[Floating Point Calculations]
@Label[fpc]

Floating point numbers are double precision (64 bit), and the
associated constants, scientific subroutines, etc. are
correspondingly more precise (and accurate, we hope). The
math double-precision library functions in the underlying lisp
(and thus in the underlying run-time library) are used.
However, we have noticed that some constants and numerical
algorithms (e.g. in the dilogarithm numerical routines) still reflect the
single-precision routines on the PDP-10.  If anyone cares to contribute
more accurate lisp-language routines, we would be pleased to distribute
them in future versions.  Our preference at this time would be to
have links to Fortran or C-coded routines, at least until such time
as the underlying Franz Lisp system handles floating-point computations
more efficiently.

The number of digits in the display of floating point numbers can
be reduced by use of the function @t[floatformat(type,fieldwidth,precision)].
For example, @t[floatformat(e,0,8)] will change
the default display to use 8-digit fraction E format in whatever
fieldwidth is required. F and G (the default) formats
can be specified. (corresponding to the UNIX operating system
printf function)

There are extensive facilities for
interaction with numerical software written in Fortran or C.
We have experimental interfaces for the IMSL library, although
this requires an IMSL-licensed system.
For example, IMSL's ZRPOLY, for polynomial zero-finding on the VAX,
can be used (it is "autoloaded" at Berkeley) when first used e.g.
@Begin[Example]
 zrpoly(x^2-1,x);
@End[Example]
Some details are available in 
Douglas Lanam's SYMSAC 81 paper. Further
information
on numerical/algebraic facilities is being produced.

The value of @t[ratepsilon] for the VAX is initially about 2.775e-17
(that is, (0.5)@-[53]5) rather than 2.0e-8.

@Section[Storage]
@Label[storg]

Programs which run out of storage on the PDP-10 may
run successfully on the VAX, however the address space
available to a user is in practice restricted by operating
system constraints, some of which have been incorporated as
parameters in the Lisp system.  An error message which declares
"Attempt to allocate beyond static structures" indicates that
you will have to have a reconfigured Lisp system to grow larger.
You should save
your computation and make a larger Lisp system and Vaxima.  This
takes about 4 cpu minutes on a VAX 11/780, but will in general require
that you be familiar with the instructions for generating a system,
and that the object code is on-line (the ".o" files).  Since the current allocation is
much larger than the PDP-10, you should also take this opportunity
to ask if you really want to continue with the computation.  Large
jobs tend to run rather poorly unless you have a lightly loaded
system or high priority.

It is possible to fiddle with various allocations to attempt to
decrease the number of garbage collections in a system which you
suspect will require large amounts of space.  The "alloc"
is different from the pdp-10's: alloc(<spacetype>,<numberofpages>) allocates
some number of pages.
Spacetype is likely to be list, but could be fixnum or other
"Franz" spaces.  Try 
@Begin[Example]
	alloc(list,1000);
@End[Example]
for example. There are
64 cons-cells on a page. See the Franz Lisp manual for more details.

The message "[@t[fasl hole filled up]]"  which you may provoke by using
the fasl program, is merely informative, and is not an indication
of trouble.

If the Macsyma variable 
@t[gcprint]
is set to a non-false value then
after each garbage collection a summary of current memory allocation
will be printed out in this form: [@t[*list:553{87%}; fixnum:23{27%}; ut:87%]].
The meaning of this is that after garbage collection and subsequent
allocation of new data space, there are 553 (512 byte) pages of list data and
23 pages of fixnum data. 87% of the list space is used and 27% of the fixnum
space is used.  The * before list indicates that it was list space which ran
out and caused the garbage collection. The ut indicates the percentage
of time utilized in non-garbage collection mode.  The first time the
message is printed, this item will be 0%, which indicates only that
various counters have been initialized. The allocation of storage is
automatic; you will never be asked to make a decision about which data
space to allocate, although a low utilization measure is an indication
that automatic allocation is not set appropriately for your problem,
and various parameters could be fiddled with.

You will not encounter difficulties loading out-of-core
files (the "nocore" message) since all the files fit in core. 
An option at system generation time allows for some rarely used 
files to not be loaded. They will be loaded automatically should
any programs contained in those files be needed.
The size of a
vaxima is approximately 2.3 megabytes (and can be more);
at least 1 megabyte is shared between users.  Typical "working sets"
are much smaller than that; how much smaller is a question
being studied; we suspect that 0.5 megabytes is a typical size during
CPU-bound operation.  There is a limit on the size to which a particular
system can grow (currently about 4 megabytes), which can be exceeded
by re-compilation of the lisp system and construction of a larger vaxima
as indicated above.
There are
other limits on the size of a job that are imposed by the operating
system configuration and the number of other jobs using the paging
device.  Clearly you cannot exercise a 64 megabyte address space unless
you have 64 megabytes of disk space.

@Section[Control Characters and Escapes]
@Label[cce]

You are not provided the same set of control characters to
enter break loops, turn on garbage collection messages, etc. that are
provided on the PDP-10.
You can halt computation with a designated character 
(default is <@i[rubout]> or ^C at Berkeley). 
This is discussed under debugging, below.

Your UNIX erase character (often backspace at Berkeley) and
your line-kill character (often @ or ^U at Berkeley) and your
word-kill (default ^W) are
used by Macsyma too.  You can change these with the UNIUNIX
command "@t[stty]" or "@t[tset]".

You can invoke the UNIX shell by typing 
@t[shell();]
at
a command line. Alternatively, you can type ^Z, in the 4BSD 
UNIX shell, to stop your job and suspend it in background.
Many options are available at this point, including "@t[fg]"
which returns to your job in the foreground, "bg" which sets it going
in background, etc.
To return from the 
@t[shell();]
command to Macsyma,
type 
@t[exit].
To exit from Macsyma and kill your Macsyma
job, type 
@t[quit();]

Other UNIX commands can be executed from
Macsyma by invoking the exec command on a string 
argument: @t[ exec("whoami"); ] or @t[ exec("ls -l"); ]for
example.  An integer
return-code is the value of such a command, zero if no error.

The sequence ^B <@i[return]>  [^B is <@i[control]>+B]
goes into lisp from Macsyma, @t[(reset)] returns to Macsyma. Other options
are discussed in the section on debugging in this addendum.

@Section[Describe Database]
@Label[ddb]

The describe command is using a database obtained from MIT in April, 1982.
It may not be installed on your system, since it requires extra disk
space.  We have not attempted to revise the descriptions to reflect
exactly the VAX Macsyma commands.  Most descriptions, however, are correct.
In case of conflicts, assume that this document is most relevant.

Adding features to the system can be done by defining functions
in a file (compiled if appropriate) and loading the file in via the 
"@t[mdoit]" file  (see  "How to make a Vaxima").
If users add facilities represented by new commands, it would be useful
to put a description of each such commands in the local
mac/manual/descrips directory.
Other users can access this information via the describe command and the
apropos command.  (Try describe(describe);)
The example command can also be augmented by providing example text in the
mac/manual/examples directory.

@Section[Plotting Curves]
@Label[pc]

A version of Plot which uses the UNIX
UNIX graph/plot package, for output
on daisy-wheel printers, dot-plotters, tektronix scopes, etc., is
available, and can be used in a simple way by specifying
@t[plot(]f(x),x,left,right,points@?[)];  where points= number of points.
The command @t[plotout()]; actually produces the plot on your terminal
(the type of your terminal is determined from your environment).
It is possible to use other devices by specification of an
argument to plotout.)

@Section[|SHARE and Other User-Contributed Files|]
@Label[sh!oucf]

With a few exceptions, "SHARE" files defined as of May 1, 1982 on the
MIT-MC computer, are
included on this tape.  The missing files were particularly dependent
on facilities available only on the PDP-10 "ITS" system.
Not every file has been checked out,
and some undoubtedly contain MIT-MC or PDP-10 dependencies.
A number of "DEMO" files are available, too.

Various strategies are available for finding files, but you can
always get to a file by using the appropriate full path name.
If your directory search path has been set up correctly, @t[load] will
accomodate partial file name specification.
The Macsyma variable @t[file_search] is set to a list of directories
to be searched, and can be modified.  Be sure to enclose directory specifications within
double-quotes. 
For example, if the "demo" directory were not already in the search
path, you could access those files by their simple names on Berkeley's CSvax,
("Ernie Covax") where they are in the directory @t["/vb/mac/demo",] 
by executing @t[file_search:cons("/vb/mac/demo",file_search);].

Files which are available at MIT can be usually be used without
change and may be transported as Macsyma-level
text or lisp text.  The object file formats ("fasl") on the two
machines are incompatible, but a lisp text file from MIT can be
compiled locally.

@Section[Bugs and Debugging]
@Label[bad]

Bugs in Macsyma in the VAX version may be the result
of bugs in the lisp code in which case they can often
be exhibited on non-VAX
systems, or may be unique to VAX (or VAX/UNIX) environments.

In order to aid in debugging, there are packages similar to those 
described in the main body of this Manual, although since
the character-interrupt handling is somewhat different, debugging is described
here.

You have an interrupt character, usually <@i[rubout]> or ^C, which you have
chosen as your standard under UNIX. If you wish to halt a computation,
you can type this interrupt character one, two, or three times.

The first character will cause an interrupt at the next
available clean place in your
computation at the interface between some compiled and some interpreted code,
or at a garbage collection.  If the interrupt does not happen promptly
enough for you, you may type the interrupt character a second
time.  This will snap
"transfer links" which are used when compiled code calls compiled
code, and then cause an
interrupt at the next such function-call.  As a side effect, it will slow
down execution until the transfer links are re-established at the first
execution of a particular transfer.
It is possible to be caught in a very tight loop in which there are
no function calls, 
in which case the third typing of the interrupt character will stop the computation
cold.
Even using this drastic interrupt,
you will generally
be able to avail yourself of any of several alternatives.

When the system stops, it will type
@Begin[Example]
	Interrupt (type h for help):
@End[Example]
You can then type one of several atoms:
*** begin indent  5,10; here@t[ r], 
Just return (after displaying the time if @t[ showtime ] was set to @t[true ] or @t[ all.]);

@t[ q],
Return to the top-level of Macsyma,

@t[ exit],
Exit from Macsyma,

@t[ l],
Enter a lisp break,

@t[ m],
Enter a Macsyma-break.

@t[ h],
Type a menu of options. 
*** begin indent ends here
Usually it is possible to get more debugging information from the
lisp system (at a cost in execution speed) by typing @t[debugging(true);]
to macsyma  (or @t[(debugging t)] to lisp).  The relevant functions which
will be more helpful in these cases are the lisp functions
@t[(baktrace)]
and 
@t[(showstack)].

If you are in a debugging break, the
prompt will have a D to its left. Typing ^D steps one level up out
of a break loop, and typing 
@t[(reset)]
to
lisp gets to the top level of macsyma.

It is also possible to quit temporarily out of your job by typing ^Z.
See your UNIX manual for details.
It is currently not always possible to catch asynchronous
interrupts which occur in user-written
"foreign" functions (C, Fortran). We hope to remedy this soon.

@Section[Typesetting of equations]
@Label[typ!set]

Phototypeset output can be obtained by several routes. The
most straightforward  at the moment is to use the 
@t[writefile]
command in Macsyma or the 
@t[script]
command in UNIX to put your 
output character stream into a file, and turn on the "@t[EQN]" display 
processor by the Macsyma command 
@t[typeset:true;]

You can also have the system initialize various parameters via a subsequent
call to:
@t[phototinit()].

The resulting file can be run through the equation processor
and the typesetter (at Berkeley, one of the dot-plotters), by
the command
@Begin[Example]
	eqn filename | vtroff.
@End[Example]

Some Macsyma-level flags affect the typesetter characteristics as
follows:
@Begin[Example]
Flag        Default     Meaning of default

photottolc      t       translate upper-case to lower
phototwidth     5       default width of display is 5 inches
phototindent    0       indentation from left margin is 0 inches
phototdebug   false     photot debugging information off
phototcsiz      10      initial point size is 10 pt.
phototbreakup   t       attempt breakup of multi-line expressions
@End[Example]

@Section[Initialization]
@Label[init]

It is possible to have your vaxima job automatically initialize your
environment. This mechanism can be used to customize your system by
loading in particular facilities or altering the syntax of expressions,
initializing variables and flags, etc.

When vaxima starts up, it loads files with names
<@i[vaxima-main-dir]>@t[/vaximarc.l] and @t[.vaximarc] from the current
HOME directory.  The first of these files is intended for the use of
system programmers primarily for the correction of bugs or the
printing of messages. We used the notation <@i[vaxima-main-dir]> for the
file-system directory where Macsyma sources, shared files, etc. are
located, if they are on-line.  The second is for your use, if you wish
to initialize the system with your own default values, functions, etc.

If the files exist (they need not), they must contain lisp code, not macsyma code.

@Section[|Mail and Send|]
@Label[ms]

The mit-mc system has commands which enable the user to send mail
to the "bug-reports" file, and to other users.  UNIX users can
interrupt their jobs (e.g. with control-z), use the system Mail command,
and resume using "fg".  Each site running VAX Macsyma should have a designated
contact person to deal with problems that can be locally resolved.
If you believe there is a bug or report which should be shared
with others,
there is a vaxima-bugs mailing list at Berkeley, to which problems
may be sent via arpanet  (kim:vaxima-bugs@berkeley) or uucp (ucbvax!kim:vaxima-bugs).
U.S. Mail should be directed to Prof. Fateman (EECS Dept., UC, Berkeley, CA
94720, USA).

Some functions such as runtime, alarmclock, and other monitoring
facilities pertaining to disk file sizes, directories, etc,
will generally not work as described by the manual or @t[describe].
Overall, you should consider using the facilities in UNIX itself,
rather than the internalized view of the operating system that
is more relevant on PDP-10 systems.

@Section[Other]
@Label[the!rest]

In the 4BSD UNIX system, the message 'killed' or 'out of core' immediately
after the starting of a vaxima means that there is currently insufficient free space on
the swapping device to run vaxima.  This situation is
is system load dependent: when the load decreases, try again.

Some status functions operate differently.


@Section[Differences between the VAX UNIX version and the VAX/VMS version]
@Label[diff!vaxvms]

In general, the VAX/VMS system will lag behind UNIX in features requiring
interaction with the operating system because we do not generally
use VMS at Berkeley. Furthermore, many VMS systems are configured
to so restrict the use of virtual memory that Vaxima cannot be loaded.
Usually a 4 megabyte virtual address space is needed, although most
users do not require a large "working set".  This is, however, dependent
on system load.  There are also references
in the UNIX portion above, to UNIX operating system facilities such
as the shell, the phototypesetter processing capabilities, graphics,
Fortran, and the file system.  Most of these facilities can be made
to work under VMS with the "Eunice" package.

For VMS systems, a file named @t[dr0:[foo.bar.baz]stuff.mac] can
be referenced as @t["/dr0:/foo/bar/baz/stuff.mac"] in Vaxima.  A file in the
current working directory named @t[stuff.mac] can be refered to simply
as @t["stuff.mac"].

Control characters for VMS:  rubout works to erase a character, control-Y exits
to VMS DCL level, control-B exits from Macsyma top-level to lisp.
@t[(reset)] returns to Macsyma. (Other things may work too)

Describe can be but has not been moved to VMS yet.

Making a new system on VMS is currently much more
complicated, and requires a Eunice license and
a UNIX license for your system.
