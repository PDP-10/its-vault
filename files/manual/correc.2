ROOTSQUAD has been superceded by POLYFACTOR, which has a
slightly different actin.  See one of the UPDATE files
for details.  The Manual should be updated.

rootsquad has no affect only anything.  should it?  The manual says it
does something.

I offer this suggestion once more:  the MACSYMA manual should have a list
of error messages,, including those which may originate from lisp, and an
explanation of each.  Also messages should start uniformly with something
alphabetizable; e.g.  instead of ;foo unbound variable, 
;unbound variable - foo.  especially bad this way is the message from apply
for wrong no. of args.
  It displays thhe most cavalier attitude towards users to suppose they can
make sense of "out of bit blocks gleep!" etc etc.  If the error messages are so clever,
let us read them all together.
   thanks.

in manual, p 178 and 179, fasldisp is redundantly described.  it does not
do what i wanted, namely cutting off all loading messages, not just autoloads.

NEW MANUAL, P 226, REALZERO HAS BEEN REDONE ENTIRELY.  IT IS
USED FOR MY PAPER IN CONFERENCE.  THE NAME IS PRRID1(POLY)
(ALSO PRRID2, PRRID3) AND THE FILE IS RJF;FLISP > (OR FASL) I THINK.  
REMIND ME AND I'LL GIVE MORE INFO.  IT IS FASTER THAN REALROOTS FOR
POLYS WHICH HAVE FEW REAL ROOTS, AT LEAST SOMETIMES.  IT IS OCCASIONALLY
MUCH FASTER.
ALSO P 260 LINE -7  TWO DINGS?

OTHERWISE, FIRST GLANCE THROUGH IT SEEMS NICE.
