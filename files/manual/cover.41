This manual was written by Richard Bogen with contributions by
Jeffrey Golden (editor, storage management, debugging, and batch chapters), Michael Genesereth (relational data base, appendix on the grammar), and Alexander Doohovskoy (explicit tensor manipulation).  We are extremely grateful
to Pitts Jarvis for the many hours he spent in formatting it for the PUB program to use the Xerox Graphics Printer and to Ellen Lewis for her helpful assistance.
