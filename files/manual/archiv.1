.function(TRIGSUM,exp)
exploits the TRIG-onometric SUM-relation
sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) - 1  = 0
in its different formulations:
sin^2 + cos^2 ==> 1, 1 - sin^2 ==> cos^2, 1 - cos^2 ==> sin^2,
selectively where they are beneficial, so as to return
that mixture of SIN and COS that constitutes the least number of terms.

TRIGSUM uses the sum-substitutor in STENSR.  For references and
pointers see SHARE;STENSR USAGE.  TRIGSUM tests space to be sure on MC
that the STENSR program will fit before it loads STENSR up.  The workspace
consumption should be smaller than explicit substitutions sin -> cos.

TRIGSUM accepts all trig functions as input, i.e. also TAN, COT, SEC 
and CSC, and converts them to SIN and COS, so that all equivalent 
formulations of the relation  sin^2+ cos^2 = 1  are exploited fully 
(decreasing the number of terms).  Then it also combines back the SIN's 
and COS's into the most advantageous combination of the other functions.  
E.g., negative powers of SIN or COS are replaced with CSC and SEC.
Both conversions are integrated, costing negligible extra time.
