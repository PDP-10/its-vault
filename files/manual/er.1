.appnd(Error Messages)

This section is not intended to be a complete list of all MACSYMA's
error messages.  It is merely intended to describe in general error
messages which are most likely to be encountered by the user, help
him identify their source, and indicate ways to remedy the situation.

The first thing to do with an error message is to identify which
program is sending the message.  Since MACSYMA runs in a Lisp system,
which in turn is running in an operating system, there are three possible
sources for an error message:  the operating system, Lisp, and MACSYMA.

As a rule of thumb, on ITS: A message from the operating system will
be in all upper case and will usually "bounce" you out of MACSYMA.  A
message from Lisp will have a ";" at the beginning of the line.  And a
message from MACSYMA will usually be in English, often a complete sentence.
