-------------

General comments:
  Shouldn't all occurrences of "**" be updated to "^"?

  In the general format of a function description, the parens around
    the args of the function are italicized.  They might look better not.

Chapter 2:
__________

2-2:  In the second paragraph there is a reference to "Appendix II".
This is now Appendix III.  It was II in version 9.  Perhaps it would
be best to tag the appendix and reference the tag, as is done with sections.
Meanwhile I changed the II to III.

2-4:  Table at top of page has some entries that are abbreviated and
some entries that share lines.  If they did not share lines, there would
be no need to abbreviate.  It would also look nicer.
Double factorial should have its own line and its own name.

2-5:  The footnote regarding the use of square brackets is unnecessary
in the SCRIBE version and should be deleted.

2-6:  The description of lexpr definition:
An example that is used runs a "wrong number arg" test that is not
really necessary.  A possible repair:

MYMAX(A,[L]):= IF L=[] THEN A ELSE APPLY('MAX,CONS(A,L))$

One possible shortcoming of this alternative example is that it is
totally unnecessary since MAX does the same thing.  Perhaps a new
example should be found?

2-7: There is an occurrence of "ith" which should have its th elevated.

2-8:  In the general discussion of assignment of array elements, it might
be useful to add "(if one has been defined)" after "associated function".

2-8: I'm not sure we want to keep the following paragraph:

In order to use a subscripted variable as a single entity without it
being an array and without ever assigning a value to it, it should be
prefixed by an apostrophe to avoid it being confused with a non-subscripted
variable of the same name.  For example SUBST(0,W,W+'W[0]).

The question I have is connected with the quoting.  The comment in the
paragraph does not adequately explain what is going on.  It may be that this
section was written before OPSUBST was added?

2-10:  "The subscripts, which are not
evaluated at definition time, must be either all numeric or all symbolic. "

I do not believe that this is true.

2-17:  Clean up the table: remove double quotes, space out correctly, etc.

Chapter 3:

3-2:  Top of page.

This is meant to be a warning, but it is not emphatic enough.  An example
would be good.  e.g., RAT(X^50!) or something.

Chapter 4:

4-3:  Instead of:
The user may have to reset it in DDT with :TCTYP as well.  See [Lew1].

Propose:

On some operating systems, it may also be necessary to reset it at
the system level.  See [Lew1].

4-3:  7th pgph, 2nd sntc:  The file name description is specific to ITS
and will need to be generalized for other systems.

4-3:  7th pgph, 4th sntc:  can also be compiled lisp code.

4-4:  The discussion of setup_autoload contains a mysterious reference
to J0 etc. which is probably a relic of the place from which this text was
taken.  This reference should be deleted.  There should also be a pointer
to the setup_autoload function description.  Also there is some ITSiness
in the description, and unnecessary detail.

propose:

Also: $fun<SETUP_AUTOLOAD> (see $ref<phints>)
can be used to provide automatic loading of
function definitions that are stored in disk files.
You can then use those functions
directly without explicitly loading the files that contain them.


Chapter 5:

5-5:  The default value of %PHI is typed in here as well as on page 1.
It would be better to do it in only one place and create a tag.   This
should be done for SCRIBE version.

5-6: The "coeff" should be given explicitly.  It Is:
zeta(2*n)=bern(2*n)*4^(n-1)*%PI^(2*n)*(-1)^(n+1)*(2*n)^N/((2*n-1)!*(2*n+1))

5-9:  The definition of LI[1] is broken on the page.

Chapter 6:

General comments:

 [1] There were several tabs in RMCH6A 126.  Untabified.

6-1:  Another "default value in brackets" that needs to be changed for
      the SCRIBE version.

6-3:  Top of page, parallel sustitution explanation conflicts with
      the one on 6-2.

6-10: (c5)->(d8) are not really necessary.

6-12:  The DISTRIB examples should be in example format.

6-15:
macro calls are in upper case in FACTORSUM.  Does this matter?  Will it
be ok for RZ's program?

6-16:  In the description of nthroot there is a "nth" THat should have
its "th" elevated, and probably the n should be italic.

6-17:  The ROOTCON table has a column heading that is too wide.

6-29: The default value of %PHI has a spurious vertical bar. 

6-29: l'Hospital is misspelled.  The leading l should be lower
cased,(fixed) and there should be a circumflex over the o. 

6-31: The bessel equation should be in display format.

6-32: The line labels skip several numbers from the previous page.

6-37: I spotted a definition for APPLY_NOUNS on page 6-37 that appears
to be wrong in that it says EV(EXP,NOUNS) is the same thing as
APPLY_NOUNS(EXP). For example:
EXP:DIFF(A^2,A);
A:2;
APPLY_NOUNS(EXP);
EV(EXP,NOUNS);
In fact, APPLY_NOUNS avoids evaluation and thus does not use the value of A,
while EV causes A to be evaluated and the DIFF call to respond with the
appropriate error message. Please check to see the manual has a more
consistent definition in the next version. 

in the DPART description, add "does when INFLAG is FALSE" after
"PART".

6-41:  The SUBLIS entry has:
  SUBLIS will preserve sharing where possible. eg, SUBLIS([A=B],C+D);
  returns a pointer to the original C+D since no substitution is needed.
  SUBLIS does substitutions in parallel. eg, SUBLIS([A=B,B=A],SIN(A)+COS(B)); 
  returns SIN(B)+COS(A).
  SUBLIS will preserve CRE form, too. eg, ....
One problem with the above is that SUBST([A=B],C+D) behaves the same way,
so this is not a good example.
Proposal:

SUBLIS preserves sharing where possible.  For example, if the common
subexpressions C+D in A:[C+D, C+D] are physically shared in memory,
then SUBLIS([C=B],A) returns [B+D, B+D] with sharing between
the common subexpressions B+D.  This differs from the behavior of SUBST,
which makes no attempt to preserve sharing.
SUBLIS also does
substitutions in parallel, so SUBLIS([A=B,B=A],SIN(A)+COS(B)); 
returns SIN(B)+COS(A).  Contrast this with the behavior of SUBST, which
returns SIN(A)+COS(A).
Unlike SUBST, SUBLIS preserves CRE form, too.

6-48:
In line with my previous suggestion for PICKAPART, and for exactly
the same reasons, I would like to suggest that the REVEAL example be changed
to:
(C1) EXP:(A+B)/2+SIN(X^2)/3-LOG(1+SQRT(X+1));
					  2
				     SIN(X )   B + A
(D1) 	    - LOG(SQRT(X + 1) + 1) + ------- + -----
					3	 2

(C2) REVEAL(%,2);
(D2) 		  Negterm + Quotient + Quotient

(C3) REVEAL(D1,3);
			      SIN   Sum(2)
(D3) 		      - LOG + --- + ------
			       3      2

Same reasons as PICKAPART, see ASB;MDOC FIXED and look for the string
PICKAPART.

6-65:  LMXCHAR and RMXCHAR do not have their defaults in standard
       format.  This causes them to be left out of the index.

6-69:  The second pgph implies that [rat(x^2)] might be automatically
converted.  It isn't, but I don't think it should be either, since lists
of CREs can be useful.  Perhaps an explicit exception for automatic
conversion of lists should be added.

6-71:  NUM and DENOM and the sentence just below appear also on 6-49.
Either this instance or the one on 6-49 should be removed.

6-72:  The FASTTIMES entry does not explain that the polynomials
must be in CRE form and have equal varlists.

6-75: The table in the M1PBRANCH entry should have been kept together
with no page break permitted.  In fact, since there is very little text in the
entry, it is possible that the whole thing should be kept together, no page
break.

6-80: POIS examples.
    JPG@MIT-MC 04/22/83 04:40:01 Re: POISEXPT
    To: ASB at MIT-MC
    CC: ELLEN at MIT-MC, JPG at MIT-MC
       ASB@MIT-MC 04/21/83 15:54:11
       POISEXPT does not autoload.  This causes the manual example page 6-80
       to fail.
    The manual may wish to point out that only POISSIMP, INTOPOIS, OUTOFPOIS, 
    and PRINTPOIS autoload.  (This note is relevant probably only to PDP10 
    based Macsymas.)

6-82:  There are some ITS filenames in pgph 2.

6-83: There should be no page break after the heading
"Multivariate Taylor Series Expansions." 

6-85: Under the TAYLOR entry that explains ASYMP, the "-ord)" should be
exponentiated.

6-88 thru 6-91:  These pages contain a sequential set of examples that
contain a few glitches:
[1]  Line 3 (C3, D3) is missing (possibly it once existed?).  If there is
no longer a line 3, all subsequent lines should be renumbered to reflect
this.
[2]  Line 5 at the top of page 6-89 contains a declaration for J.  J is not
needed, so this declaration should be deleted.
[3]  The latest version of MANUAL;RMCH6B > has had the references to TRIGSUM
deleted, but the line numbers of the example have only been partially updated.
  ----[3] is fixed.

6-93:  The form returned by ILT has
changed a bit.  So line D4 should now read:

		     SQRT(A B (A B - 1)) T
	      2 COSH(---------------------)	  2
			       B	       A T
(D4) F(T) = - ----------------------------- + -------
		    3  2      2		      A B - 1
		   A  B  - 2 A  B + A

						      2
					    + ------------------
					       3  2	 2
					      A  B  - 2 A  B + A
Also, the D3[1] in line C4 should read just D3.

6-94: the info on LAPINT is all wrong, I think. The file
is SHARE;SPECFN FASL, and the function in that file is SPECINT(expr,ovar)
which requires that expr contain an explicit EXP(-nvar*ovar) as well as
anything else that can be handled by ELL's HYPERGEOMETRIC files.
the example on the bottom line runs over to the next page in a confusing way.

Also, the filename is ITS-specific.

6-94:  There is a broken display at the bottom.

6-95:  The LAPINT example should be redone.  See ASB;MQUERY 180.
First, something must be done about sign of P.  The example asks
about the sign of P, but in general P is the transformation variable,
so it should be allowed to be complex.  Without looking into the 
mathematics a bit more carefully, it seems to me that the question
should not be asked.  Next, the LOAD has to be added at the beginning
of the demo.  Also the line D6 contains a FALSE when you run the demo
now at mc (4-20-83).  Many of the forms now returned are slightly
different from what appears in the manual.

6-96:  There is a th that should be elevated in BERNPOLY.

Chapter 7:

7-4:  The DOMAIN entry might mention M1PBRANCH.  Instead of:

$var<DOMAIN/REAL> - if set to COMPLEX, SQRT(X^2) will remain
SQRT(X^2) instead of returning ABS(X).  The notion of a "domain" of
simplification is still in its infancy, and controls little more than
this at the moment.


Propose:

$var<DOMAIN/REAL> - if set to COMPLEX, SQRT(X^2) will remain
SQRT(X^2) instead of returning ABS(X).
The setting of DOMAIN also changes the effects of M1PBRANCH.
The notion of a "domain"  of simplification
in MACSYMA is still in its infancy.


Chapter 8:


Chapter 9:

9-2:  FREEOF
seems to imply that FREEOF(C+D,[C+D,1]) is for some reason unacceptable.
It should say that the xi can be any Macsyma expression.
Whether FREEOF will find it or not is another question.
(complete subexpression problem, as in SUBST).  But the way things
are now, the entry seems to be saying that FREEOF will not except C+D.

9-4: and 10-7 REMRULE example and info are not adequate in my opinion.
REMRULE(simpexpt,"^RULE1"); gives the error: "^RULE1" - no such rule.
this actually means that there is no rule by that name for simpexpt.
it is exceptionally non-obvious that the user should have to type in
REMRULE("^","^RULE1"); in the example because "^" is never returned in
any way by using TELLSIMP, while simpexpt is.

9-7: pgph 4:
      There is an occurrence of "product" that probably should be 2prod1.

9-7:
In the LETRAT entry, 2expr1 is undefined.  I suspect that it is
meant to refer to the arg of LETSIMP, but there is no way for the first-timer
to figure this out.  A possible alternative would be "the argument to LETSIMP"
or something.

9-9:  Lines C1 and D1 probably should be C6 and D6.

Chapter 10:

10-1: "section (see 15)"  ?  (Probably should be (see chapter 15).
      "see (see 15)"      ?  (Probably should be (see chapter 15).

10-1:  BREAK, DEBUG, DEBUGPRINTMODE, all appear elsewhere in more complete
forms.  Either they should be deleted here or pointers should be added to
these entries.
BREAK: 10-17,  DEBUG: 15-7, DEBUGPRINTMODE: 15-8.

10-2:  "see (see 15)"      ?  (Probably should be (see chapter 15).

10-4:  The REVEAL entry from page 6-48 is exactly duplicated here.

10-9:  There is a stretch of italics that ought to be Roman in pgph 2.
Perhaps the problem is that the return to roman from italic occurs
inside the macro?

10-9: LOADFILE
Among other ITSiness, The reference to USERS as the
directory for those who have not their own is ITS-specific, and
probably dated as well.

The file FN1 FN2 can also be compiled code.  This is not mentioned.

10-9: FILE_SEARCH
The examples are ITS.

10-9: WRITEFILE, CLOSEFILE, and APPENDFILE have ITS type args.

10-14:  Why is line C5 there?  It would be better if there were a
C6 that RATSIMPed D4 to 0 or something.  Perhaps it got clipped off?
I recall that there was a recent user question on this point.
(or something similar).

10-14:  pgph at bottom and top of next page duplicates that on 7-2.
Perhaps this is unintentional.

10-20: TIMER_DEVALUE
really doesn't belong here.  It would make more sense to put it
on page 15-7 with the function that it affects, TIMER.

10-24:  The MODE_DECLARE example at the bottom is too wide.

10-27:  COMPILE's switches 
I can't verify them.  One problem is that STATUS(UDIR) is a Lisp construction
but not Macsyma.  Probably should be DIREC.  Can't find these switches in
the tags file.

Chapter 13

13-2: STORENUM, FILESIZE,DEVICE, DSKALL are all missing their defaults.

13-3:   pgph 5
Some Itsiness.

13-4:  item 5 is ITS-dependent.

13-5:  last pgph:  SAVE or STORE are mentioned, but not FASSAVE in 1st line.
(although it is mentioned later)

13-6:
The filename in the SAVE example is ITS type, as is some of the discussion.

The 1st sentence of 1st pgph mentions lines arrays,functions, etc.,
but not gradefs,  macros or let_rule_packages.

Chapter 15

General comments:
 [1] Copyright notice updated at RMCH15 27

15-8:
Items 2,3,4 are indented, but should line up with item 1.

Appendix II

General comments:
 [1]  I am assuming that this document comes from MANUAL;NVAX >.
      Possibly it should be renamed?
 [2]  There are references to VAX, PDP-10, and UNIX.  These are probably
      all trademarks, but no acknowledgement is given.

II-5:
In the font switching in the first paragraph of section II.8, there is a
switch to font 3 that is followed by a return to font 2.  The return should
probably be to font 1.  This is what causes the burst of italic in this
section.


Appendix VII

VII-1:  The reference to Appendix II should be Appendix III.  I have
made this change, but it should be changed to a tag when the Appendices
are tagged.

VOLUME 2:

v2-4-23:  MUCII is not in the references.

v2-4-24:  MUCI is not in the references.

v2-4-24:  "Check with ELL"  should be replaced with real documentation.

v2-4-25:  "Please send bug mail to ELL" and the rest of this pgph should
          be deleted.

v2-4-25:  FFF() has its parens split.
          The Rainville refernence should be put into standard format.

v2-4-26:  VERBOSE1:  not a sentence.

v2-4-26:  The indentation is not standard for the flags on this page.
          The reference to ELL@MC should be updated.  (to something like
          "Macsyma consultant").
