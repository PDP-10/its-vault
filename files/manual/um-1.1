Suggestion for Primer Section:
A fairly frequent problem new users encounter and illustrates
the problem they have with evaluation is the following:
f(x):=a*%e^(a*x)*(sin(c*x)+a*cos(a*x);
a:sqrt(c^2+x^2);
c:sqrt(1+x^2);
diff(f(x),x);
assuming he wants the differentiation carried out on the a's and c's
this wont work (since c doesn't get evaluated).  i can think of 3 
possible ways to do this problem.

1] dont use functions
f: ...: a: ...; c: ...;
ev(f,eval)$ diff(%,x);
ok. but user might have to do another application of ev to get the
evaluation he wants.

2] define things the other way round
c: ...; a: ...; f: ...;
diff(f,x);
the result returned by f: ...; might be large making typos difficult to see
also you have to think a bit about the order in which things are done.

3] define everything in terms of functions
f(x):= ...; a(x):= ...; b(x):= ...;
diff(f(x),x);
does the evaluation ok, but it's a pain to type the (x)'s all over the place.

I think the expression vs. function issue bears some discussion.  (A lot of
new users get stuck on one way of doing things.)  How about a flag to
ev meaning evaluate the first argument as much as possible.  I've often seen
people do ev(f); diff(f,x);  (thinking that ev(f) actually changed f).  (I'm
not necessarily advocating any change in MACSYMA, but I would like to see all
this discussed somewhere.)
