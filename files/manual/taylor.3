.sec(Taylor Series,taylor)

.function (TAYLOR,|exp, var, pt, pow|)
expands the expression 2exp1 in a truncated Taylor series (or Laurent series,
if required) in the variable 2var1 around the point 2pt1.  The terms through
(2var1-2pt1)**2pow1 are generated. If 2exp1 is of the form
f(2var1)/g(2var1) and g(2var1) has no terms up to degree 2pow1 then
TAYLOR will try to expand g(2var1) up to degree 2*2pow1.  If there are still
no non-zero terms TAYLOR will keep doubling the degree of the expansion of
g(2var1) until reaching 2pow1*2**n where n is the value of the variable
$var<TAYLORDEPTH/3>.
.endfunction
The switch $var<TAYLOR_LOGEXPAND/TRUE> controls expansions of logarithms in
TAYLOR series.  When TRUE all log's are expanded fully so that
zero-recognition problems involving logarithmic identities do not
disturb the expansion process.  However, this scheme is not always
mathematically correct since it ignores branch information.  If
TAYLOR_LOGEXPAND is set to FALSE, then the only expansion of log's
that will occur is that necessary to obtain a formal power series.

If $var<MAXTAYORDER/TRUE> is TRUE, then during algebraic manipulation of (truncated) Taylor series,  TAYLOR will try to retain as many terms as are certain to be correct.

2Multivariate Taylor Series Expansions1
.skip 1
For multivariate functions, there are several ways of obtaining Taylor series expansions.  If the variables are truly independent and all singularities involve only one variable
at a time then the expansion may be done as follows:
.scon
5TAYLOR2(exp, var1, pt1, ord1, var2, pt2, ord2,...)
1
.scon
or
.function(TAYLOR,|exp,[var1,pt1,ord1],[var2,pt2,ord2],...|)
.endfunction
.scon
Naturally the two techniques may be intermixed.

However, if  the variables are interdependent or singularities involving
 some of the variables together can occur then the following
scheme is to be used:

.function(TAYLOR, |exp, [var1, var2, . . .], pt, ord|)
where each of 2pt1 and 2ord1 may be replaced by a list which will correspond to the list of variables.  that is, the nth items on each of the lists will be associated together.  

.endfunction

2The user should be warned that this scheme uses the RATWTLEVEL scheme implicitly whenever the variables are expanded to different orders.  In this case the user must not be trying to use RATWTLEVEL simultaneously.1

.begin turn on "[^]"
Internally this is done in the following manner; for each Xi substitute
.skip 1
.once center
Xi -----> T^[^[ni]] Wi.

Then a term like  X^2 Y^3 Z would become
.skip 1
.once center
T^[^[2 n[a1]* + 3 n[a2]* + n[a3]*]] W[a1]*^2 W[a2]*^3 W[a3]*
.end
.skip 1
.continue
and truncation is done on T.  The W variables as well as T are not seen by the user.  The following are examples of the various modes of Taylor expansions.

.example
(C5) TAYLOR(SIN(X+Y),X,0,3,Y,0,3);
.begin group

		 3	  2	   2    3  2    3

If one wants to handle asymptotic expansions a facility exists
to some extent. It may be invoked as follows.

.function(TAYLOR,|exp, [x,pt,ord,ASYMP]|)
will give an expansion of 2exp1 in negative powers of (2x-pt1).  The highest order term will be 
.endfunction
.begin turn on "[^]"
.skip 1
2
.once center
(x - pt)^[-ord]
.end
1
.scon
The 2ASYMP1 is a syntactic device and not to be assigned to; for example, one types TAYLOR(F(X),[X,0,4,ASYMP]).
.scon
If the user is expanding polynomials he may specify a truncation level of INF in which case the expansion will never truncate.

.function (DEFTAYLOR,|function, exp|)
allows the user to define the Taylor series (about 0) of an arbitrary
2function1 of one variable as 2exp1 which may be a polynomial in that variable or
which may be given implicitly as a power series using the SUM function.

.skip 1
In order to display the information given to DEFTAYLOR one can use
POWERSERIES(F(X),X,0). (see below).

.example
(C1) DEFTAYLOR(F(X),X**2+SUM(X**I/(2**I*I!**2),
	I,4,INF));

.end

.endfunction


.function(TAYLORINFO,exp)
returns FALSE if 2exp* is not a Taylor series.  Otherwise, a list of lists is returned describing the particulars of the Taylor expansion. If any switches
are given in the expansion (e.g. ASYMP), the value of the switch is given in
the result.  For example,

.example
.begin group

(C3) TAYLOR((1-Y^2)/(1-X),X,0,3,[Y,A,INF]);
	     2			      2

            + (1 - A  - 2 A (Y - A) - (Y - A) ) X

	 2			  2   2

            + (1 - A  - 2 A (Y - A) - (Y - A) ) X

 + . . .
.end
(C4) TAYLORINFO(D3);
(D4) 			   [[Y, A, INF], [X, 0, 3]]
.end
.endfunction


.function (POWERSERIES,|exp, var, pt|)
generates the general form of the power series expansion for 2exp1 in the
variable 2var1 about the point 2pt1 (which may be INF for infinity).  In
cases in which POWERSERIES is unable to expand 2exp1 the TAYLOR function may
give the first several terms of the series.


$var<VERBOSE/FALSE> - if TRUE will cause comments about the progress of POWERSERIES
to be printed as the execution of it proceeds.

.function(PADE(,|taylor-series,num-deg-bound,denom-deg-bound|)
returns a list of
all rational functions which have the given taylor-series expansion
where the sum of the degrees of the numerator and the denominator is
less than or equal to the truncation level of the power series, i.e.
are "best" approximants, and which additionally satisfy the specified
degree bounds.  Its first argument must be a univariate taylor-series;
the second and third are positive integers specifying degree bounds on
the numerator and denominator.

PADE's first argument can also be a Laurent series, and the degree
bounds can be INF which causes all rational functions whose total
degree is less than or equal to the length of the power series to be
returned.  Total degree is num-degree + denom-degree.  Length of a
power series is "truncation level" + 1 - minimum(0,"order of series").
