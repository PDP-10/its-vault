MACSYMA (Project 2MAC*'s 2SY*mbolic 2MA*nipulation System) is a
large computer programming system written in LISP [Mn1] used for
performing symbolic as well as numerical mathematical manipulations.
It is being developed by the Mathlab Group of the MIT Laboratory for
Computer Science (formerly Project MAC).


     With MACSYMA the user can differentiate, integrate, take limits,
solve systems of linear or polynomial equations, factor polynomials,
expand functions in Laurent or Taylor series, solve differential
equations (using direct or transform methods), compute Poisson series,
plot curves, and manipulate matrices and tensors. MACSYMA has a
language similar to ALGOL-60 to permit the user to write his own
programs for transforming symbolic expressions.

This manual is intended to be a complete reference for the principal
features of MACSYMA as of the date shown on the cover.  It is not
meant to be a tutorial nor does it discuss all of the issues involved
in the efficient manipulation of algebraic expressions. New features
under development are, for the most part, not mentioned.

The user who is unacquainted with certain concepts of computer
programming may find this document difficult on first reading.  The
novice will benefit by first reading the 2MACSYMA Primer1 [Mo5] and
2An Introduction to ITS for the MACSYMA User1 [Lew1]. This document
serves as both a reference manual and as a user's manual.  When it is
used as a user's manual, any sections not of interest should be
skipped.  Sections which may be passed over on first reading are
indicated by the symbol [] around the section number.

It is recommended that this manual be re-read from time to time after
the user has worked with MACSYMA so that certain parts which were
unclear on prior readings will be better understood in the context of
increased familiarity with the system.

In a programming system such as MACSYMA there are often many ways to
go about solving a given problem as well as many constraints and
frustrations which must be dealt with.  Some ways will not succeed due
to space or time constraints and others may work but may be
unnecessarily slow.  Frequently a better understanding of the computer
facilities will lead to a reformulation of the problem lending itself
to a much improved solution. For some insight into the subject see
[A1, Mo1, Mo2].

.tty_"Good grief, is this for real?... You gotta be crazy!"

MACSYMA is implemented on the MIT-MC machine, a DEC PDP-10 computer
which uses the ITS operating system, on Honeywell 6180 computers using
the Multics operating system, on DEC-20 systems, and on DEC-Vaxes. The
following section concerns the protocol for usage on the MIT-MC
(MACSYMA Consortium) machine.  Appendix I of this manual concerns the
use of MACSYMA on Multics.  Appendix II of this manual concerns the
use of VAXIMA, the Berkeley-Unix VAX version.

A user may gain access to the MIT-MC machine by (1) finding a terminal
connected to it or (2) finding one on which he can dial to it over
public telephone lines or (3) logging into it over the ARPA network.
Once this is done the user should be communicating with the ITS time
sharing system.  To login he should type a control-Z (depressing the
control key while typing the letter Z) which loads in DDT [Lew1] (the
top level system program).  Then he should type :LOGIN followed by a
space and his user name.  (All system commands, i.e. those which begin
with a colon, are terminated by a carriage return).  At this point the
user can start up any of several system programs available (PEEK,
TECO, etc.) by typing a : followed by the name of the program and a
carriage return.  In
particular :MACSYM loads in and begins execution of MACSYMA. After
printing some descriptive information, including the version number,
MACSYMA prints (C1) which means that it is ready to accept input from
the user.  The entire sequence is shown below with the computer's
output indented.  ^2char1 $$ The user should note that there is a
separate character, ^, which is often used for exponentiation (as in
line (C1) below).  Although the two characters print in the same way
the user should have no difficulty distinguishing between them. In the
example, the "^5" could not be "control-5" since the context strongly
indicates exponentiation.* means the control key is to be held down
while the next character 2char1 is typed.
.example 
     MC ITS nnnn CONSOLE ii FREE $$nnnn represents a version number which changes from time to time;  ii identifies the console.*
^Z $$Not printed on console*
     MC ITS nnnn DDT mmm
:LOGIN SMITH
     Password:
     [OK]
:MACSYM
     This is MACSYMA vvv

     FIXVVV N DSK MACSYM being loaded
     Loading done$$The "fix file" is the place for temporary fixes for MACSYMA between versions.  We pride ourselves on rapid turnaround on bug-fixes, so it is actually rare to see a MACSYMA which does not have a fix file.*

     (C1) NROOTS(2*X^5-X+5,-4,8);

     (D1)                1

^Z
     [DDT]
:LOGOUT
     MC ITS nnnn CONSOLE ii FREE

.end

In line (C1) the user has typed a command which asks for the number of
realroots between -4 and 8 of a quintic polynomial.  In line (D1)
MACSYMA has printed the answer. The ^Z causes an exit from MACSYMA to
DDT after which the system typed "[DDT]" to indicate that the user is
being returned to monitor level.  Typing :LOGOUT causes the system to
delete all the user's jobs (in this case MACSYMA was the only job) and
to log him out of ITS.  When the user finishes he should always log
the console out before he leaves.

.sec(General Information, geninf)

Command lines to MACSYMA are strings of characters representing
mathematical expressions involving equations, arrays, functions, and
programs.  Extra spaces, tabs, and carriage returns are ignored
(except when these occur in quoted strings, i.e. within "double quotes",
also known as "quotation marks".  Such "quoted strings" are more or
less like Basic Print statements and are taken literally).

Command lines are terminated by ";" (semi-colon) or "$" (dollar sign).  A ";"
causes the command line to be evaluated and the result displayed.  The
terminator "$" causes the command line to be evaluated but the result
is not displayed.  Usually $ is used for inputting assignment statements,
where you know what the "output" will be, or for very complicated results which
you do not want to see but just want to compute with later.  Semi-colon (";")
is the usual command line terminator.

When typing command lines, depressing the "rubout" or "delete" key
deletes the previous character (on hardcopy devices and displays which
cannot backspace, the deleted character is echoed).  By typing
"control-K" , a redisplay of the line, with the "erasures" done, will
be printed.  This helps you keep track of where you are and what you've
really typed.  The two characters ??  delete the whole
command line, and cause the line number to be redisplayed.

The command (input) lines are indexed by labels of the form "(Ci)"
where i is incremented with each new command line typed by the user.
Similarly, the results of computations are also indexed.  There are
two types of output lines.  The ordinary output line is indexed by a
label of the form "(Di)" ; thus, usually the ith input-output pair
will be (Ci)-(Di).  Sometimes, however, a computation produces several
intermediate results (for example, several solutions to an equation);
it is convenient to be able to reference these intermediate lines of
output.  They are indexed by labels of the form "(Ej)" where j is
incremented by one for each intermediate line.  For example,

.example
.begin group

(C1)  SOLVE(X^2 + B*X + C, X);

				     2
			       SQRT(B  - 4 C) + B
(E1) 			 X = - ------------------
				       2
.end
.begin group
					 2
			       B - SQRT(B  - 4 C)
(E2) 			 X = - ------------------
				       2
.end
(D2) 				 [E1, E2]
.end

Note that there is no line D1 since intermediate results were produced and thus the line index was incremented.  The general pattern of indexing is of the form
.skip 1
.once center
Ci, Ei,Ei+1,...,Ej, Dj .

A command line may refer to the results of any previously indexed line (even if it was not displayed) through the use of the line labels.  For example, the user might say SUBSTITUTE(7,B,E2); which would substitute 7 for B in the expression E2 above.   The immediately preceding D-line  is conveniently referenced by the symbol "%".  

If the input line contains a syntax error, it will be reprinted and the location of the error will be indicated as closely as possible by a special string, ***$*** .

From a C-line, the user in need of assistance can type:

.function(SEND,|"message"|)
which will send your 2message* to all MACSYMA system programmers who
are logged in at that time.  If no appropriate recipient is available,
the message will be sent to MACSYMA's mail file where it will be seen
and will be answered.  E.g.  SEND("Help!"); .  2message1 may be more
than one line long and must be enclosed in double quotes.  SEND();
prints out an explanation of how to use it.
.endfunction

.function(SEND,|name,"message"|)
will send your message to the person whose user 2name* you include.
.endfunction

.function(BUG,|"message"|)
sends a bug note to MACSYMA.  The syntax is the same as for SEND.  BUG();
gives information about its usage.
.endfunction

.function(MAIL,|"message"|)
sends mail to MACSYMA using the syntax of SEND.  Like SEND it may take an
optional first argument of a person's user name.   MAIL(); gives information
about its usage.
.endfunction

The SEND, MAIL, and BUG commands will also accept expressions as arguments
in messages, so that
.example
BUG(C1,"Returns",D1,"Is this right?");
.end skip continue
will display the value of line C1 in the message, print  "Returns" as
text on a line by itself, then display D1's value, and finally print
"Is this right?" on a line by itself.  This saves retyping of long expressions
to send to MACSYMA mail or as bug messages.

For information, there are several useful commands:

.function(APROPOS,string)
takes a character string as argument and looks at all
the MACSYMA names for ones with that string appearing anywhere within
them.  Thus, APROPOS(EXP); will return a long list of all the flags
and functions which have EXP as part of their names, such as EXPAND,
EXP, EXPONENTIALIZE.  Thus if you can only remember part of the name
of something you can use this command to find the rest of the name.
Similarily, you locate a command or commands dealing with a particular
type of expression by using a string which would be mnemonic for that
operation.
.endfunction

.function(DESCRIBE,entity)
takes as argument any MACSYMA 2command, option*, or 2concept* and
prints out a description of that entity.
.endfunction

.function(EXAMPLE,command)
gives examples (in DEMO mode) of the use of selected functions in MACSYMA. 
.endfunction

.function(PRIMER)
provides an on-line primer for the novice including an introduction to
MACSYMA syntax, assignment and function definition, and the
simplification commands.  The primer is also available from DDT level
with the command :TEACHMACSYMA.
.endfunction

.sec(Levels of Control,control!levels)

When :MACSYM is typed,  a LISP system extended with MACSYMA programs is loaded
into main memory from auxiliary storage. Special top level programs read in, evaluate, simplify, and display the user's expressions.  All of
the functions to be presented in subsequent sections are actually LISP programs
which, when they are called, may invoke many other LISP programs in a process
that is invisible to the user. 

Switching between DDT, MACSYMA, and the LISP system in which it is embedded is
accomplished by typing the following characters:

Control-^ typed while in MACSYMA causes LISP to be entered.  The user can now type any LISP S-expression and have it evaluated.  Typing ($fun<CONTINUE>) or ^G (control-G) causes MACSYMA to be re-entered.

^Z causes an immediate exit to DDT.  If one is already in DDT then ?? is
printed.  At this point the user can run some other program like PEEK or TECO
[Lew1].  When in DDT, typing :CONTINUE causes the current job to be resumed.
(:JOB MACSYM should be typed first if the user wishes to re-enter a MACSYMA
which is not the current job).
.begin group
.sec (Miscellaneous Information, miscellaneous!information)

Files in the ITS system have two names each of at most 6 characters.
They are referenced by giving the two names as well as the device
(default is DSK) and the directory name where the file resides
(default is the same as the user's login name, or is an assigned
directory, see below).  A > sign may be used for the second file name
and stands for the name which is the largest numerically if there
exists a file with the given first name and a numeric second name;
otherwise, the > sign represents the "greatest" name in an
alphanumeric sense. A < sign may be similarly used for the "least"
name.
.end
Any of the four descriptors (1st name, 2nd name, device, user) may be omitted
and either the default or the value given in a previous command (if there was
one given) will be used.

For those without a disk directory of their own, there are a number of
USERS2i1 directories available, currently USERS0 thru USERS9.  Each
user will be automatically assigned to one of these alphabetically by
his user name. The DDT command :HSNAME may be used (:HSNAME
2Username1) to find out which directory one has been assigned to.
When placing a file on this directory the user should indicate in some
manner (such as by the first file name) the name of the user who
created it.

There is a special mail file on the ITS system for holding comments
from users which are of general interest and for listing changes to
MACSYMA which occur from time to time. The DDT command :MAIL MACSYM
followed by a carriage return and text terminated by a control-C is
used to place comments in this mail file.  The user's login name and
time of message are added automatically.  (Control-D may be used to
cancel this or any other DDT command prematurely).  If the user
encounters any bugs in MACSYMA then he should report these in MACSYMA
mail.  Mail may also be sent to other users by using the :MAIL command
followed by the user's login name, or by the MAIL command in MACSYMA.
If the user has received mail the message --MAIL-- will appear on his
console after he logs in.  Typing a space will cause the mail to be
printed.  The DDT command :PRMAIL MACSYM is used to print out the
MACSYMA mail file.  The user should do this occasionally to be
informed of changes to the system and of other users' comments.
:PRMAIL may also be used to print out any user's mail by following it
with the user's login name.  Control-S may be used to silence the
printout.  In addition, the command :PRINT MACSYM;UPDATE > may be used
to print a file describing updates to MACSYMA since the last version
of the manual.  The update file should be checked regularly so the
user can be informed of changes to MACSYMA.

For further information on DDT commands see [Lew1].  Typing :? will list the commands
with a brief description.  In particular, one command worth noting is :KILL which kills
the current job.
