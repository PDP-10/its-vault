                                   Acknowledgment


This  manual  was written  by  Richard  Bogen with  contributions  by  Jeffrey Golden
(editor,  storage  management,  debugging, and  batch  chapters),  Michael Genesereth
(relational data base, appendix  on the grammar), and Alexander  Doohovskoy (explicit
tensor manipulation).  We are extremely  grateful to Pitts Jarvis for the  many hours
he spent in formatting it for the  PUB program to use the Xerox Graphics  Printer and
to Ellen Lewis for her helpful assistance.
