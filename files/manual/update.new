Homogeneous polynomials are a bad case for EZGCD (GCD:EZ). 
If you find yourself running into space problems with homogeneous 
polynomials, you probably want to use reduced GCD (GCD:RED).

MACSYMA #266 has just been created.
New feature:
The new option LOADPRINT determines whether printing of the loading 
message upon loading a file is done.  It replaces the now extinct 
option FASLDISP.  It is more flexible than the previous FASLDISP 
as follows:
LOADPRINT:TRUE$ (the default) means always print. 
			(corresponds to FASLDISP:TRUE$.)
LOADPRINT:'LOADFILE$ means print only when the LOADFILE command is used.
			(corresponds to FASLDISP:FALSE$.)
LOADPRINT:'AUTOLOAD$ means print only when a file (such as an integration
	file e.g. SIN FASL) is automatically loaded in.  (new)
LOADPRINT:FALSE$ means never print.  (new)

In Macsyma 266 there will be a new switch GCD.  Its
values currently can be EZ, RED, MOD, OR FALSE corresponding
to the selection of ezgcd, reduced, modular, or no gcd algorithm.
False means that gcd will always return 1.  This replaces the old
switches takegcd, ezgcdswitch, and gcdswitch which will then be ignored.

The file SHARE;INVERT > finds the inverse of a matrix using the adjoint 
method.  This allows a user to compute the inverse of a matrix with bfloat 
entries or polynomials with floating pt. coefficients without converting to 
cre-form.  The DETERMINANT command is used to compute cofactors, so if 
RATMX is FALSE (the default) the inverse is computed without changing the 
representation of the elements.  The functions ADJOINT and INVERT are 
provided.  The current (temporary?) implementation is inefficient for 
matrices of high order.

There is a new flag BFTORAT controlling conversion of bfloats to 
rational numbers via the RAT commands.  If FALSE (the default), 
RATEPSILON (see the manual) will be used to control the conversion, 
thereby generating relatively small rational numbers which will help 
many of the algorithms in MACSYMA which use CRE representation. 
If TRUE, the rational no. generated will accurately represent the 
bfloat.  Try e.g. RAT(BFLOAT(%PI)); .

I have written some functions to make the printing of files and the
listing of directories easier for Macsyma users.  It autoloads, so you 
can read its documentation by saying Printfile(Fileop,Usage,Dsk,Share).

SOLVE now prints a warning when it throws away solutions of things
involving trig functions by converting to the arc-trig functions.
This warning is controlled by a flag SOLVETRIGWARN which defaults
to TRUE.  SOLVE will soon handle things correctly by introducing
arbitrary parameters ala ALGSYS (or rather, %ARB and %ARBINT will
be used as the parameters, and maybe ALGSYS will be changed to agree?)
SOLVETRIGWARN will then be replaced with a flag to make that optional.

(Thanks to DAS,) there is a new command SORT(list,{optional-function}) 
of one or two args.  If given just one arg, a list, it sorts it using 
MACSYMA's built-in order-predicate (known to LISPers as "GREAT"), e.g. 
SORT([1/2,2,1]); gives [1/2,1,2].  If given two args, the second may 
be any predicate-function of two args with which to sort by.  E.g., 
"<", ">" may be used which have access to ASSUME information.
Also, two predicates ORDERLESSP, ORDERGREATP of two args are now 
available to give the user access to "GREAT".  Hence, SORT([1/2,2,1]); 
is equivalent to SORT([1/2,2,1],ORDERLESSP);.

Share;Cgamma Usage describes a fast and accurate routine to
calculate the Gamma function in the complex plane.

SOLVE now will try to decompose polynomials to solve them if factoring fails.
To suppress this, set SOLVEDECOMPOSES (like SOLVEFACTORS) to FALSE.
Solve no longer ever thinks random constants are variables if you give it only
one argument.

[1] DECLARE(F,ANTISYMMETRIC); now works.  F may be a function of any 
number of args.  The sign is determined by the parity of interchanges 
needed in sorting the args.  (Times-ordering (i.e. that for "*") is 
used as in the case of COMMUTATIVE.)  E.g. F(A,B) gives F(A,B), 
F(B,A) gives -F(A,B), and F(A,A) gives 0.
[2] DECLARE(F,SYMMETRIC); may be used as a synonym for 
DECLARE(F,COMMUTATIVE);.

RZ@MIT-MC 08/10/77 20:47:04
POLYDECOMP(poly,var), a new command, returns a list of polynomials
[f1(var),f2(var),...,fn(var)] such that poly = f1(f2(f3(f4...))).  
There is no other decomposition which involves more polynomials, 
excepting linears.

By popular demand, a new command READONLY exists which is the same 
as READ except that it does not evaluate what it reads.

MAXIMA 265 has just been created in NEWIO LISP.
To repeat: Essentially what this means is that one can have more than one 
channel open for reading and more than one channel open for writing, at 
the same time.  There is no real change in MACSYMA #265, however it will 
soon be possible thereby to e.g. do a BATCH and a LOADFILE together, or 
to do a WRITEFILE and a SAVE at the same time, with no special indication 
or effort on the part of the user.

New feature: If "exp" contains %I, ABS(exp) now calls CABS.
