I made a file SHARE;COMPL HINTS
which has some basic things.

To be honest, the real problem I have in documenting it is
that I don't want to document features which in the long
run I consider BUGS. Also, if I name ALL the swithces somebody
will say "what a crock, all those damn swithches" and the
will be right! Oh well.

I hope that COMPL HINTS give the basic theory behind compilation.
Thats what I would best like to give, a little of the theory
of WHY you would want to compile, and then some examples.
(Maybe some examples first). A definite example of
how to put something on the SHARE directory and compile it.
(HINTS for PACKAGE writers).

Then a list of all the switches. But without a little theory
people won't have the confidence and understanding they need
to do things non-randomly.
