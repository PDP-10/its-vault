PLOT2 was primarily written by me (Charles Karney) during 1975-76
while I was a graduate student in the Plasma Physics Group of the
Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at MIT.
Several other members of the Plasma Physics Group contributed
assistance and ideas.  In particular John Kulp was responsible for
overseeing the computational side of the group's activities and
installed the system of graphics terminals that allowed MACSYMA to
become a useful tool for online graphics.

This work was supported by the Department of Energy.
