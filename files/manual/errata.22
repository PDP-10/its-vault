  Shouldn't all occurrences of "**" be updated to "^"?

  In examples, the group macro should be used to bind together not only
   multiple-line Dlines, but the associated C-line as well.  This would
   improve the appearance of examples that are now being broken up.
   For example, see bottom of pages 2-14, 2-18, 6-77, or p 6-58. -asb
  In the general format of a function description, the parens around
    the args of the function are italicized.  They might look better not.

  Some overstriking near the bottom:  not enough room for section number.
  Also on the line for HIDE3D.
  Some of the ". . . . . . "'s extend underneath the names.

Chapter 2:
__________

General comments:
 [1] Changed many "which"es to "that"s in version RMCH2 37.
 [2] Updated copyright notice of RMCH2 37.
 [3] Added default values of MACSYMA variables
     where needed throughout RMCH2 38.
 [4] Did some regrinding to eliminate screen wraparound in version 38.

2-1:  Top of page there is a statement that default values are indicated
in square brackets.  This will have to be changed to reflect
the new format in the Scribe version.

2-2:  There is a spurious "in" in the 4th line of the first paragraph.
"or in as descriptive titles" should be "or as descriptive titles". -Fixed

2-2:  In the second paragraph there is a reference to "Appendix II".
This is now Appendix III.  It was II in version 9.  Perhaps it would
be best to tag the appendix and reference the tag, as is done with sections.
Meanwhile I changed the II to III.


2-4:  Before explaining EXPT and NCEXPT, might insert something like:
---
The following two forms are sometimes used in the display of large
exponential expressions when the usual two dimensional display becomes
unweildy.
---
Then the EXPT and NCEXPT entries can be changed to:
---
$fun<EXPT> is sometimes used to display ordinary exponentiation.
If there is not enough room for the usual display
A^B, it will appear as EXPT(A,B).

$fun<NCEXPT> is sometimes used to display non-commutative exponentiation.
If there is not enough room for the usual display
A^B, it will appear as NCEXPT(A,B).

2-5:  Second sentence, changed a "a" to "an".  
-Fixed.


2-5:  The footnote regarding the use of square brackets is unnecessary
in the SCRIBE version and should be deleted.

2-5: "user defined"  should be "user-defined". -Fixed.

2-5:  FUNCTIONS is missing its default value.  -Fixed.

2-6:  The description of lexpr definition:
An example that is used runs a "wrong number arg" test that is not
really necessary.  A possible repair:

MYMAX(A,[L]):= IF L=[] THEN A ELSE APPLY('MAX,CONS(A,L))$

One possible shortcoming of this alternative example is that it is
totally unnecessary since MAX does the same thing.  Perhaps a new
example should be found?

2-7: There is an occurrence of "ith" which should have its th elevated.

2-8:  Top of page:  A sentence of introduction would be good:

Another way to create arrays is provided by MAKE_ARRAY.

2-8:  There should be a line of whitespace after the MAKE_ARRAY description.

2-8: Change "stay around", which is colloquial, to "remain". -Fixed.

2-8:  In the general discussion of assignment of array elements, it might
be useful to add "(if one has been defined)" after "associated function".

2-8: I'm not sure we want to keep the following paragraph:

In order to use a subscripted variable as a single entity without it
being an array and without ever assigning a value to it, it should be
prefixed by an apostrophe to avoid it being confused with a non-subscripted
variable of the same name.  For example SUBST(0,W,W+'W[0]).

The question I have is connected with the quoting.  The comment in the
paragraph does not adequately explain what is going on.  It may be that this
section was written before OPSUBST was added?

2-9:  Change "If one is going to define" to "If one wishes to define".
-Fixed.
Change "times then if" in last paragraph of 2.6.2 to "times, it".
-Fixed.

2-10:  "The subscripts, which are not
evaluated at definition time, must be either all numeric or all symbolic. "

Huh?  I do not believe that this is true.

2-12:  An extra then in third paragraph.
-Fixed.

2-13: it is not necessary to mention the file ARRAY FASL, since
the functions in this section all autoload. -Fixed.

2-14: Ther is a parenned sentence at end of 1st pgph of Matirx section.
No need for parens. Also in 2nd pgph.
-Fixed.

2-14:  The reference to Appendix II should be to III.  -Fixed.

2-18:  Spurious "then" in second line.
-Fixed.

2-20:  Unnecessary parens just below the three forms of the DO.
-Fixed.

2-22:  96 should be 90.
-Fixed.

Chapter 3:

3-2:  First pgph of evaluation section needs a comma after "line".
-Fixed.

3-3:  Second line needs comma after LISP and "order".
-Fixed.

3-3:  Appendix VI should be Appendix VII.
-Fixed.

3-3: footnote:  doesn't should be does not.
-Fixed.

3-3: pgph 4:  "was because" should be "happened because".
-Fixed.

3-4: "names which have values" -> "names that have values"
-Fixed.

3-4: " operators which give the" -> " operators that give the"
-Fixed.

3-5: The integrals symbol in d11 was not regulation.  (also in version 9).
-Fixed.

Chapter 4:

Changed copyright notice to 83.

4-3: 2nd pgph: "later on" -> "later"
-Fixed.

4-3: 3rd pgph: "characters which" -> "characters that"
-Fixed.

4-3: 5th pgph: "a function" -> "some functions"
-Fixed.

4-3: 6th pgph: insert comma after LISP.
-Fixed.

4-3: 7th pgph: "the facility" -> "a facility"
-Fixed.

4-3: 8th pgph: delete the second "For example"
-Fixed.

4-3: Last line of text:  add a colon at end
-Fixed.

4-4: 1st line:  "tells that it" -> "tells LOAD that this"
-Fixed.

4-4: 3rd line: delete "up"
-Fixed.

Chapter 5:

5-2: arg of FLOAT should be X.
-Fixed.

5-4: arg of DEMOIVRE should be X.
-Fixed.

5-5: arg of FIBTOPHI should be X.
-Fixed.

5-5: GAMMA(I) changed to GAMMA(X).
-Fixed.

5-7: Period needed at end of LOGARC entry.
-Fixed.

5-8: "the the" -> "the" , doesn't -> does not.  Period missing at bottom.
Removed parens.  "follows, e.g." -> "shown below"
-Fixed.

5-9: A cap GAMMA has been used to denote the Euler-Mascheroni constant,
but the convention is a lower case gamma. 
-Fixed.


Chapter 6:

General comments:

 [1] There were several tabs in RMCH6A 126.  Untabified.
 [2] which -> that, don't -> do not, can't -> can not, doesn't -> does not.

6-2:  Which -> that in pred entry.
      was -> is in 2nd last pgph.
      comma after "evaluated".
      comma in last line after "order"
-Fixed.

6-3: DOTFACTOR was missing its default.
-Fixed.

6-3:  Unneeded parens in pgph 3.
      "the the"  -> "to the"
      (5): "was" -> "is"
      Unneeded parens in example commentary and in last pgph.
-Fixed.

6-4:  EXPAND entry, pgph 1:  which -> that,
	removed some unneeded parens, added a "both".
	comma after RATEXPAND.
	PGPH2:  "TERMS" takes the plural verb.
	pgph4:  which -> that, removed parens.
	pgph5:  which -> that
-Fixed.

6-5:  RATEXPAND entry.
(if a sum)  -> , if it is a sum,
pgph3:  stop -> prevent,  deleted "up".
-Fixed.

6-5:  It would be better to keep (C1) of the RATEXPAND example together
with the rest of the example. (no page break).
-Fixed.

6-10:  "the original answer" -> exp.
-Fixed.

6-11: The MULTTHRU entry on page 6-11 implies that
MULTTHRU(A+B,C*D) returns the same as MULTTHRU((A+B)*C*D).  This is not
true, so possibly the second sentence of the entry should be changed
or deleted. 
Removed unneeded parens in example commentary.
-Fixed.

6-12:  XTHRU entry.
remove unneeded parens in line 1.
comma after denominator in line 2.
Comma after cancelled.
-Fixed.

6-14:  INTFACLIM entry.
delete "the user's"
       GCFACTOR entry
i.e. -> which are
-Fixed.

6-15:  SQFR

-Fixed.
       GFACTOR
i.e. -> which are the ordinary integers with
delete "where A is %I".  This could be very confusing to the novice.
-Fixed.

6-16:  The analogy factors:terms:list in the description of PARTITION
should be factors:terms:sublist. 
-Fixed

6-16:  In the description of NTHROOT a ^F1 was inadvertently a f1, which
caused an italic q to print like qf1, and left the 4italic case turned on
accidentally.  I changed the "f" to ^F (control-F)
-Fixed.

6-16:  The "if" just below the LOGCONTRACT example should be capitalized: If.
last line:  E.g. -> For example
-Fixed.

6-17:  The ROOTCON table has a column heading that is too wide.

6-17:  The first line of text below the ROOTCON table is unnecessarily
parenned.
3rd pgph:  e.g. -> For example.
-Fixed.

6-18: line 5:  may -> can
SUMEXPAND:  added "causes", are -> to be.  Moved the if FALSE sentence to
above the example.  Delete the E.g.
-Fixed.

6-19:  SUMCONTRACT, INTOSUM
change tense from future to present to conform to 90% of other entries.
delete "essentially", "idea".
-Fixed.

6-22:  tag missing in second line, should refer to 6.1.1.

6-24:  Top of page, the "U  T" belong as subscripts in the example of
the previous page.  

6-25:  Appendix III -> Appendix IV

6-28:  MACSYMA does not behave as suggested by the CHANGEVAR example.
First, the display in d1 is not regulation.  It appears to have been
edited incorrectly.  Also, in executing D2, Macsyma would want to
know about the sign of A.  I ran off this example again, and here is a
transcript.  Perhaps it should replace what is there now.

(C1) ASSUME(A>0);
(D1) 			     [A > 0]

(C2) 'INTEGRATE(%E^SQRT(A*Y),Y,0,4);
		      4
		     /
		     [	  SQRT(A) SQRT(Y)
(D2) 		     I  %E		  dY

		     /
		      0

(C3) CHANGEVAR(D2,Y-Z^2/A,Z,Y);

-Fixed.

6-29: The default value of %PHI has a spurious vertical bar. 

6-29: l'Hospital is misspelled.  The leading l should be lower
cased,(fixed) and there should be a circumflex over the o. 

6-29: There is a missing verb in the second sentence in LIMSUBST.
added "used".  
-Fixed.

6-31: Missing space after "equations" in ODE2 entry.
-Fixed.
Added "it is" after "When".
-Fixed.
Deleted "to the user".
-Fixed.

6-32:  small d's in the DERIVATIVE display
-Fixed

6-37: I spotted a definition for APPLY_NOUNS on page 6-37 that appears
to be wrong in that it says EV(EXP,NOUNS) is the same thing as
APPLY_NOUNS(EXP). For example:
EXP:DIFF(A^2,A);
A:2;
APPLY_NOUNS(EXP);
EV(EXP,NOUNS);
In fact, APPLY_NOUNS avoids evaluation and thus does not use the value of A,
while EV causes A to be evaluated and the DIFF call to respond with the
appropriate error message. Please check to see the manual has a more
consistent definition in the next version. 

6-41:  The SUBLIS entry has:
  SUBLIS will preserve sharing where possible. eg, SUBLIS([A=B],C+D);
  returns a pointer to the original C+D since no substitution is needed.
  SUBLIS does substitutions in parallel. eg, SUBLIS([A=B,B=A],SIN(A)+COS(B)); 
  returns SIN(B)+COS(A).
  SUBLIS will preserve CRE form, too. eg, ....
One problem with the above is that SUBST([A=B],C+D) behaves the same way,
so this is not a good example.
Proposal:

SUBLIS preserves sharing where possible.  For example, if the common
subexpressions C+D in A:[C+D, C+D] are physically shared in memory,
then SUBLIS([C=B],A) returns [B+D, B+D] with sharing between
the common subexpressions B+D.  This differs from the behavior of SUBST,
which makes no attempt to preserve sharing.
SUBLIS also does
substitutions in parallel, so SUBLIS([A=B,B=A],SIN(A)+COS(B)); 
returns SIN(B)+COS(A).  Contrast this with the behavior of SUBST, which
returns SIN(A)+COS(A).
Unlike SUBST, SUBLIS preserves CRE form, too.

6-57:  There is an extra space in the lines around (d8).
-Fixed.
       The default value of MULTIPLICITIES was incorrect.
-Fixed.

6-59:  Some of the vi were in upper case in the ELIMINATE entry.
-Fixed.

6-60: Top of page, there are two D3's.  Second D3 should be D4.  (fixed)

6-64: determinant misspelled.
-Fixed.

6-65:  In line C5, D4 should be D3. , [D7,D8] -> [D6,D7] in line C8.
-Fixed.

6-67: has a "noncommunitative" that should be "noncommutative" just
above the heading 6.4.1. -Fixed.

6-68: DOTCONSTRULES explanation on page 6-68 has been truncated by at
least a line -(fixed to read as in version 9)

    describe(poly_discriminant) shows it with only one arg; it takes two
    arguments, the first being the polynomial and the second being the 
    variable wrt to take the discriminant.
-Fixed. (in manual and DESCRIBE)

6-75: The table in the M1PBRANCH entry should have been kept together
with no page break permitted.  In fact, since there is very little text in the
entry, it is possible that the whole thing should be kept together, no page
break.

6-76: kernel was misspelled.
-Fixed.

6-77-8: The display of multivariate taylor series is now
with multiple ...'s.
-Fixed.

6-80: The last equation in the POISSUBST entry is not now in Macsyma
form.
-Fixed.
  JPG@MIT-MC 04/22/83 04:42:19 Re: POISSIMP
  CC: ASB at MIT-MC, ELLEN at MIT-MC
  Oh, also change the example in C7 on p.6-81 from
  OUTOFPOIS(SIN(X)^5+COS(X)^5); to POISSIMP(SIN(X)^5+COS(X)^5); .

  CC: ELLEN at MIT-MC, JPG at MIT-MC
     ASB@MIT-MC 04/21/83 15:54:11
     POISEXPT does not autoload.  This causes the manual example page 6-80
     to fail.
  The manual may wish to point out that only POISSIMP, INTOPOIS, OUTOFPOIS, 
  and PRINTPOIS autoload.  (This note is relevant probably only to PDP10 
  based Macsymas.)
  Anyway, the solution to the manual problem is to begin as EXAMPLE(POISSIMP); 
  begins.  I.e. stick in a new C2 line and move the rest (old C2, etc.) down.
-Fixed.

6-83: There should be no page break after the heading
"Multivariate Taylor Series Expansions."  It seems to me that page
breaks should never be permitted after a heading.  Perhaps this is
a bug in the macro for this kind of heading?

6-84: There is a spurious "2  3" in the TAYLOR entry just below the middle of
the page.
-Fixed.

6-85:
In line (D1) the display of multivariate taylor series is now
with multiple ...'s.
-Fixed.
In line (d2) the order is now a little different (it is strictly specified
by the args of TAYLOR.
-Fixed.

6-85: Under the TAYLOR entry that explains ASYMP, the "-ord)" should be
elevated.

6-86:  The D3 display is not the form now returned
by TAYLOR.  Perhaps this is related to the /R/ in the manual.
-Fixed.

6-86: "function" is left out just before TAYLORP.
-Fixed.
      The input lines in the POWERSERIES example should have been
in upper case.
-Fixed.

6-88 thru 6-91:  These pages contain a sequential set of examples that
contain a few glitches:
[1]  Line 3 (C3, D3) is missing (possibly it once existed?).  If there is
no longer a line 3, all subsequent lines should be renumbered to reflect
this.
[2]  Line 5 at the top of page 6-89 contains a declaration for J.  J is not
needed, so this declaration should be deleted.
[3]  The latest version of MANUAL;RMCH6B > has had the references to TRIGSUM
deleted, but the line numbers of the example have only been partially updated.

6-94: the info on LAPINT is all wrong, I think. The file
is SHARE;SPECFN FASL, and the function in that file is SPECINT(expr,ovar)
which requires that expr contain an explicit EXP(-nvar*ovar) as well as
anything else that can be handled by ELL's HYPERGEOMETRIC files.
the example on the bottom line runs over to the next page in a confusing way.

6-96: Space missing after binomial in MAKEFACT and MAKEGAMMA.
-Fixed.

Chapter 7:

7-2: isn't -> is not, "cut down on" -> "reduce"
-Fixed.

7-3: added whitespace above first example.  First example was not inside
an example macro.  It had .begin nofill group.
-Fixed.

7-4:  macsyma not capitalized, data-base -> data base.

7-5:  FACTS() fixed as per JPG's mail.

7-5:  which -> that at bottom.

7-6:  doesn't -> does not, added a warning about contradictions to
      ACTIVATE entry.

Chapter 8:

8-5: just above sectin 8.1 "equasion" should be "equation". 
-Fixed.

8-7: Some EVFLAGS and EVFUNS were missing from the lists.
-Fixed.
An occurrence of ai was not italicized properly.
-Fixed.
In the ADDITIVE entry, "(1) If" is missing just before the italicized
ai at the end of the 2nd last line.  Compare to LINEAR and MULTIPLICATIVE.
-Fixed.
In LINEAR, "a function" is missing after "(2) If 2ai1 is".
Compare to ADDITIVE and MULTIPLICATIVE.
-Fixed.

Chapter 9:

9-1:  There is spurious "<" in line 1 of NONSCALARP.
-Fixed.

9-4: and 10-7 REMRULE example and info are not adequate in my opinion.
REMRULE(simpexpt,"^RULE1"); gives the error: "^RULE1" - no such rule.
this actually means that there is no rule by that name for simpexpt.
it is exceptionally non-obvious that the user should have to type in
REMRULE("^","^RULE1"); in the example because "^" is never returned in
any way by using TELLSIMP, while simpexpt is.

9-7: Last pgph.  "refered" -> "referred".
-Fixed.

9-8: Line C2, IS takes only one arg.  The comma should be "=".
-Fixed.

9-9:  Lines C1 and D1 probably should be C6 and D6.
-Fixed.
      Line D1 is wrong.  Should be N! (M-1)!
-Fixed.

Chapter 10:

10-1:  Section 10.1 has brackets around the 10.1.  Shouldn't. -Fixed.

10-1:       pgph  6:  "are for" should be deleted.
-Fixed.

10-6:  FORTRAN, end of 4th line: missing period. -Fixed.

10-10: WRITEFILE and CLOSEFILE needed sentence about LispM. -Fixed.

10-11:  COLLAPSE is misspelled.  That's why there are 2 index entries.
-Fixed.
        primative -> primitive.
-Fixed.

10-12:  D2 -> D1
-Fixed.

10-18: handles -> handled.
-Fixed.

10-22: --More display?--  ->  --More Display?--
-Fixed.

10-23:  One infolist is not empty:  LET_RULE_PACKAGES.
        LABELS also comes up [C1], but that probably is not worth correcting.
-Fixed. (LET_RULE_PACKAGES)

10-24:  MODE_DECLARE
For clarity, d1 -> dim1, d2 -> dim2,  etc. as in DESCRIBE.
-Fixed.

10-25: "macsyma tolisp" -> "Macsyma-to-Lisp". -Fixed.

Appendix II

General comments:
 [1]  I am assuming that this document comes from MANUAL;NVAX >.
      Possibly it should be renamed?

II-5:
In the font switching in the first paragraph of section II.8, there is a
switch to font 3 that is followed by a return to font 2.  The return should
probably be to font 1.  This is what causes the burst of italic in this
section.


Appendix VII

VII-1:  The reference to Appendix II should be Appendix III.  I have
made this change, but it should be changed to a tag when the Appendices
are tagged.
