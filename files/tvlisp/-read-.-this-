TVLISP - LISP TV PROGRAM LIBRARY 

The TVLISP directory is similar to the LIBLSP directory in purpose,
except that the software is all for using the Knight TV displays from LISP.


*** HOW TO CONTRIBUTE ***
 
First prepare a ground (with GRIND) file with the LISP source code,
and write a short info text about how to use the program.  If the info
text is short, include it in the program file as comments; otherwise
make a separate file of it.  Each file should include your name or other
identification at the beginning.  

Then put the program file in the library.  If your name is YOU and
the file's name is FOO, rename the source file as TVLISP;FOO YOU1.
The info file, if any, is likewise filed as TVLISP;FOO INFO.  If you
have a FASL file, call it TVLISP;FOO FASL.

Finally send a message to TVLISP (:MAIL TVLISP ... ) about the
contribution, since I (GLS?) will do some minimal bookkeeping of what goes
into the library.  You might also consider whether you think the inclusion
of your file is worth announcing in a public message (:MSG FOO ...).

Now if your program is what people need, they will try to use it.
If the info text is not completely exhaustive, or if there are bugs
in the program, then they might come and ask you questions.  You can
stop that, if you wish, by putting a disclaimer in the info file or
among the info comments, saying that you are happy to give away the
program, but that you do not have time to answer questions.  On the
other hand, if you do want feedback, it is worthwhile to include a
statement to that effect, since it makes it more attractive to use
the program.  

If you come up with new and improved versions of the program, they
should be called FOO YOU2, FOO YOU3, etc.  Do not contribute new
versions too often, since that will just confuse the users.  

To save disk space, users should not get private copies of library
files unless they want to change the program.  Therefore, they must
be able to rely on FOO YOUn staying the same, so please do NOT put
the revised program under the old name.  (The only exception is if
you have just modified the comments).  

As a matter of convention, to prevent naming conflicts among variables
and subroutines, it is suggested that "internal" routines and variables
all begin with some prefix, such as the name of the package.  You might
also do this for the "external" ones also, in new packages.
Be sure to document any global variables that are used that the user might
need to know about.


*** HOW TO USE ***

At the end of this file is a list of programs that are presently in
the library, with a very short explanatory text.  Look around.  Naming
conventions etc. are as above.  

If you arrange to load LISP library files using your LISP INIT file
or a similar mechanism, I suggest that you refer to them by exact
name rather than by >.  That way you will not suffer when a new and
improved version of the program appears.  

The file TVLISP;AUTODF > contains autoload definitions of many
functions in the library.  If you use library files frequently, it
might be worthwhile to load AUTODF from your LISP init file.  

TVOUT	GLS	(Also developed by numerous other people.)
		Performs basic operations of making the TV buffer be a LISP
		array.  Also provides a means of setting the TV ALU.
