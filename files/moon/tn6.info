TN6 IS FOR COMMUNICATING OVER THE NET
WITH LINE AT A TIME SYSTEMS SUCH AS MULTICS.
IT IS LIKE TELNET, WITH THE FOLLOWING CHANGES:

INPUT IS NOT SENT TO THE FOREIGN HOST UNTIL YOU HIT RETURN.
RUBOUT IS DONE LOCALLY.
CONTROL/V RETYPES THE LINE IN CASE YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT YOU'VE
RUBBED OUT.
NOTE THAT ON DISPLAY TERMINALS RUBBING OUT A BACKSPACE OR OTHER
CONTROL CHARACTER MAY PRODUCE MISLEADING RESULTS ON THE SCREEN,
SO HIT ^V.
^P ERASES THE SCREEN.
^U AND ^L ARE USED FOR CASE SHIFTING INSTEAD OF \.
HITTING SHIFT/RETURN ON A DATAPOINT WILL DO WHAT YOU MEANT.
WHEN YOU ARE USING A DISPLAY TERMINAL AND THE FOREIGN HOST OUTPUTS
A FORM FEED OR RUNS OFF THE SCREEN,
TN6 WILL SAY "--MORE--".  VALID RESPONSES ARE P (NEW PAGE),
T (GO TO TOP OF SCREEN WITHOUT ERASING), OR S (SCROLL -- WON'T
WORK UNTIL ITS SUPPORTS ^P>.)
<SPACE> IS EQUIVALENT TO P.

THE ^^ (CONTROL/UPARROW) CHARACTERS ARE:
	G	RESTART
	C	CLOSE CONNECTION
	Q	CLOSE CONNECTION AND :KILL
	B	WALLPAPER
	E	STOP PAPERING WALL
	W	SILENCE OUTPUT
	V	TURN ON OUTPUT
	^P	GIVE TTY TO DDT
	D	GIVE EVERYTHING TO DDT
	RUBOUT  I DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO HIT ^^
	U	TURN OFF LOCAL ECHOING.
	I	TURN ON LOCAL ECHOING.
