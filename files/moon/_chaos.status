Response by STATUS servers

The first 32. bytes contain the host name, padded on the
right with 0's.  The rest of the packet contains blocks
of information expressed in 16-bit words, low byte first
(pdp11/lisp machine style).  The first word in a block is its
identification.  The second word is the number of 16-bit words
to follow.  All counts are expressed in 32 bits, where
the low-order 16 bits come first.

If the identification is less than 400, it is a subnet
number and this block contains information on the host's
direct connection to that subnet.  The counts are 16 bits
rather than 32 and this is the old format.  If the identification
is 400 + a subnet number, the counts are 32 bits.
Values larger than 1000 are reserved for future use.

A subnet information block contains: (all items are optional,
according to the count field, and extra items not defined here
may be present and should be ignored.)
2  number of packets in from this subnet
3  number of packets out to this subnet
4  number of transmit aborts sending to this subnet
5  number of receive packets lost on this subnet (rcvr busy)
6  number of crc errors in packets received on this subnet
7  number of crc-2 (error after reading out of ram) errors
10 number of bad bit-count errors on this subnet
11 number of incoming packets discarded for other reasons  (?)

The chaos:hostat function on the Lisp machine will be extensively
changed to display this information, and a similar program
will probably be written for ITS.
