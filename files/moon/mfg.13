At this point I assume you have a fully-stuffed processor page
mounted to a bay, with backplane and power supply.  The power wiring
inside the bay should be all connected, including two big cables
into the page.  The hand wiring on the backplane and on the
processor should be done.  You should have ready a pre-debugged
bus interface board, but there shouldn't be anything plugged into
the backplane yet.  The internal cables between the top and bottom
parts of the processor page should be installed.

Note on smoke: When first applying power watch carefully for sparks and
smoke.  Shut the machine off when you see smoke, but don't electrocute
yourself.  The switch on the outlet strip which is on the left as seen
from the door cuts off all DC power and is easiest to get to.  You may
want to track down where the smoke is coming from before panicking and
turning off the power.

Never make or break contacts with the power on.  This includes putting
boards in, taking boards out, adjusting bus strips, etc.  I sometimes
put DIPs in or take them out with the power on, but I'm a loser.

Turn off the two circuit breakers on the power-control box and the
switches on the two outlet strips.  The left outlet strip should
be labelled "switched" and the right outlet strip should be labelled
"unswitched" (as seen from the door).  Connect AC power to the round
receptacle on the back of the power control box.  Turn on the two
circuit breakers and nothing should happen.  Turn on the unswitched
outlet strip and you should be able to turn on the flourescent
light at the top of the bay.  Turn on the switched outlet strip,
with the page opened up, watching carefully for sparks and smoke.
Fans should come on and the LED's inside the page should light up.

If you see smoke, turn the machine off and fix the cause.  Smoke is
often caused by DIPs plugged in upside down, DIPs plugged in wrong,
defective DIPs, DIP pins mashed so they short power to ground, or
incorrect wiring that shorts power to ground.  Shorts on the backplane
can be caused by incorrect wiring, bus strips plugged on wrong, screws
too long on the terminal strip touching the metal behind, or missing etch
cuts between A10B2 : A11B2 or B10B2 : B11B2.  The processor and
backplane mechanical assemblies should have been checked for massive
shorting before they were stuffed and mounted.

Check the power supplies.  Make sure the margin switch (an unlabelled
toggle switch on the power supply) is in its center position.  Connect
a digital voltmeter across pins 20 and 10 of any socket near the top of
the processor.  Adjust to 5.00 volts.  Near the bottom of the processor
will be more like 5.1 volts and on the backplane (measure between A2
and C2 anywhere) will be more like 5.2 volts, which will go down after
boards are plugged in.  The adjustment for the 5-volt supply is very
hard to get to.  It is labelled "channel-1 adjust" and it is more or
less behind some power wiring; use a flexible plastic screw driver.
The adjustment for -5.2 is "channel-2 adjust" and for +12 is "channel-3
adjust"; these are behind a protective grille but easy to get to by
poking a plastic screwdriver through.  Measure -5.2 across C2 or T1
anywhere (which is ground) and B2 where there is a bus strip.  Measure
+12 across ground and P2 at the group of 3 bus strips close together.

If the +5 supply is shorted, the short will generally burn through
and make smoke.  If one of the minor supplies is shorted, usually
it will just shut itself off.

Turn off the machine.

Plug a Unibus terminator into AB10, a Bus Interface board into
slot 11, and an Xbus Terminator into ABC31 on the pin side.

Connect bus interface cables.  The short one goes from 3AJ1 on the
processor to J7 on the bus interface.  The other four connect 1AJ1 to
J11, 1BJ1 to J12, 1CJ1 to J9, and 5AJ1 to J8.  Both ends of each cable
should be labelled with a black marker.  You should copy the
arrangement of cables from another machine.  Copy all twists, positions
of adhesive clamps, and order of passing through holes exactly.  It's
done this way for two reasons.  One is to avoid crimping the cables
when the door is closed.  The other is to make sure that the cables
come out in the right order and orientation to plug into the bus
interface.  When you have all 5 cables coming out of a clamp on the bay
near the hinge, tie-wrap them there.  Bring them over to the bus
interface with no twists and plug them in.  Tie-wrap them there.
Smooth the bundle and tie-wrap it again; some cables will be too long,
so they will have to be folded over to take up the slack, but there
should be no twists.

xxxxx  [specify cable lengths, order, location of clamps, etc.]

Power on the machine and scope pin 5A6-6.  There should be a clock
here, which is low for 75 ns and high for about 160 ns.  If there isn't
any clock, fix the clock generator before continuing.

Connect a 50-conductor debugging cable from J6 on the master machine
to J5 on the slave machine.  Type (PKG-GOTO 'CADR) on the master machine.

[Now what:
	cc-test-machine
	cc-test-clock
	Set machine running and measure the end of all clock runs.
	 Too bad it has to be running.]

[Other mechanical work that needs to be done: I/O and disk cable
panels.  Disk cables.  Console cable.  Chaos net cable.  Set-up of
Chaos net transceiver.  Set-up of disk drive.  Switch settings on IOB
and memory boards.  Re-checking of power voltages after memory and TV
boards are installed.]

Ways to get royally fucking screwed:

CC-LOW-LEVEL-FLAG must be T

CC-UNIBUS-MAP-TO-MD-OK-FLAG, if this gets set to T when you power the machine
 off it will look like it's completely broken (can't affect MD register)

Don't forget to use CC-DIAG-TRACE when appropriate.

Don't forget to turn off ERROR-STOP-ENABLE with :CHMODE before doing scope loops.
