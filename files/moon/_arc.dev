I am getting EOF's too soon on an file in an archive.
the file is AR4:RWK;HOUND SCRAM
it was written with a SIOT in ascii mode and is being read in ascii mode.
i.e.
SYSCAL SIOT,[1000,,dski ? [440700,,dskbuf] ? [5000]]

(No, I am NOT actually using literals for the SIOT arguments in my code.)

The file can be copied out with :COPY and my program reads all of the
file from DSK:

ARCDEV only returns one value for FILLEN, which fakes out MLDEV into
thinking the bytesize is huge, which screws the allocation.  ARCDEV
is best place to fix it, I guess.
