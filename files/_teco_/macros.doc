  002   COMPILED ON TUESDAY  OCT 21,1975
  003   
  004   A       add more macros.
  005               This allows you to read in more macros of your own
  006           choosing.  MA<file name>$ will load all the macros
  007           defined in the file -- the default file is assumed to be
  008           DSK:<sname>;TECO MACROS.
  009               The format of the file should be as follows:
  010                 1 macro definition per page
  011                 the definition is everything after the first
  012                    <underscore> (<backarrow> to some)
  013                 the macro's name precedes the <underscore> on that line
  014                 comments like this are removed: !* ... !
  015           
  016   
  017   B       checks for balanced (, )
  018               If given no arguments, it looks through the entire
  019               buffer; 1 argument is interpreted as specifying the
  020               number of lines in the scope, 2 args are interpreted
  021               directly.  Slashed parentheses are ignored.  The cursor
  022               is not moved.
  023           
  024   
  025   C       capitalizes words in region specified by arguments.
  026               (default is 1 line)
  027           
  028   
  029   .C      like C except doesn't move cursor.
  030           
  031   
  032   D       centers text on line currently occupied by the cursor.
  033              Arg = page width in which to center it.
  034              Default is taken from FS ADLINE$, same as for MJ.
  035           
  036   
  037   F       A file protection macro:
  038              Do MF frequently while editing to save away the current
  039              state of your file.
  040           
  041              For single-page files loaded by ER$Y, any file loaded
  042               with ER$^Y or ER$^A, and fresh unfiled text residing
  043               in the buffer, MF saves away the buffer as the
  044               default file.  MF<filename>$ saves away buffer
  045               as the named file.  Thus, when entering new text, begin
  046               with MF<file name>$ and subsequently do MF$.
  047           
  048              For multi-page files, MF stores away the current state
  049               of your entire file under the default file name.  This
  050               involves writing it out and reading it back in up to the
  051               point where the cursor was.  The funny string *:#!% is
  052               a place-keeper.  MF<file name>$ changes the name of the
  053               file.  NOTE: When finished, a final EE$ will be
  054               necessary to leave you with a properly updated file; i.e.,
  055               one without a spurious *:#$% left in it.
  056           
  057   
  058   .F      displays only that part of the directory containing files
  059               having the FIRST name same as the default file.
  060               Any file open for reading is marked with a "#".î  061                                                                              MACROS DOC  PAGE 1.1
  062   
  063   G       Guy Steele's LISP pretty-printing macro. 
  064               Pretty-prints the next S-expression following the pointer.
  065               Arguments are: comment-column, miser-width. 
  066           
  067   
  068   H       HELP - prints descriptions of TECO commands and macros.
  069               Enter name of command in question as string argument.
  070               Name macros as you would call them; e.g., MD, MZ.
  071               There may be ambiguity in searching for some commands;
  072                 if you have trouble, try "MH<command><tab>$$".
  073               Remember: control characters are listed as "^"
  074                 followed by the character itself.
  075           
  076   
  077   I       italicizes a region of the buffer.
  078                  Actually, this macro can be used quite generally to
  079               shift to a new font and back again; it merely assumes that
  080               the italics font is font 1.  Specify other fonts with a
  081               string argument.  E.g., 3FWMI4$ inserts the appropriate
  082               font 4 switches around the next 3 words.
  083           
  084

  129   Q       prepares a file for listing on the XGP or TERMINET:
  130              1MQ -> XGP;  2MQ -> TERMINET -- but if you forget,
  131                don't worry; it asks you later.
  132              The file's original paging is preserved and a heading
  133                 is added with the date and file name.  Parameters are taken
  134                 from .TJ6. (XGP) [or .TJ6. (TERM)] in your
  135                 directory, if they exist; otherwise only the .XGP command
  136                 is added (for output to the XGP).
  137              Accepts a file name as argument, or uses default.
  138                 It can accept more than 1 file name at a time -- just string
  139                 them together as arguments, separating
  140                 each with an $ (altmode) -- they will be filed together as
  141                 "@ (XGP)" [or @ (TERM)]
  142              XGP files can then be printed using XGPLPT
  143              TERMINET files can merely be listed (e.g., :PRINT in DDT
  144                 or by using MT)

  147   R       affectionately known as The Secretary Macro.
  148             Enters special ^R edit mode (see "M.R") and in
  149           addition the text in your buffer will be saved every
  150           150 characters in the file of your choice.
  151               If you wish, you can specify how often you
  152               want this to happen with an optional prefix
  153               argument.  Note: the buffer is also saved
  154               each time you switch back to normal TECO mode
  155               to execute a regular command string.
  156             Specify the name of the file as a string argument to
  157           MR (if none is given, the default is chosen for you).
  158           In the event a file with that name already exists it
  159           will be read in at the start.
  160             Whatever is in your buffer when you type MR stays
  161           there of course.
  162             You will be asked to confirm the choice of the file
  163           name before proceeding and if you reject it, the macro
  164           will ask for another name (terminate this entry with a CR.
  165           If you type just a CR (i.e. no name, just a CR) the macro
  166           is aborted.

  172              In addition to all special ^R commands,
  173              typing an altmode ($) lets you execute one normal TECO
  174              command string before returning automatically
  175              to ^R mode.  Your buffer is not saved (see MR).

  183           ^\ runs the MJ macro, thus filling the paragraph in
  184              which the cursor lies (or the next one, if the cursor
  185              is between paragraphs).
  186           
  187           ^<underscore> is a file inserting macro. It asks for the
  188             name of a file and inserts it immediately before the cursor.
  189           
  190           ^Z exits MR reluctantly; first deleting some of the files
  191              created during its reign, then asking if you want to logout
  192              altogether, and finally putting you back in MR by asking you
  193              for a new file name to save things under.
  194           
  195           These ^R mode commands have been redefined:
  196           
  197                   character  word  sentence  paragraph
  198           Forward--- ^C       ^F      ^^       ^J (linefeed)
  199           Backward-- ^R       ^B      ^@       ^H (backspace)
  200           
  201           and ^Y deletes a word.
  202           
  203           For those times when you're hacking LISP -- the M..R
  204           macro alters these definitions:
  205           
  206           ^F and  ^B move forward and backward, respectively, over atoms.
  207           ^^ and ^@ move forward and backward, respectively, over S-expressions.
  208           ^Y and ^H move up and down, respectively, within S-expressions.
  209           ^\ runs the grind macro, MG.
  210           ^J(linefeed) is useful for lining up S-expressions on input.
  211             When executed at the end of a line, it starts a new line
  212             and indents to the proper place of "pretty" code.
  213           
  214           Do M..R again to reset the definitions of these control characters.
  215           
  216   
  217   ..R     exchanges the meaning of selected ^R macros
  218             for use with lists instead of text, and vice versa.
  219                       ^F    ^B    ^^   ^@   ^J  ^\   ^H  ^Y

  262               BEWARE - the mark will move if any deletions or
  263               insertions are done before it in the buffer.
  264               Q..X holds the marker.
  265           
  266   
  267   .X      exchanges the current cursor position and the mark.

  277   Z       This macro deletes files from your directory.
  278               It only considers files with numeric second names.

  281                   (if null, chooses default file name), and
  282                 a (prefix) number - this says how many of the
