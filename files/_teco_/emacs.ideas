I found an interesting bug in TOPS-20 EMACS, almost certainly in the underlying
TECO code.  If a buffer (or the part of the buffer being worked with, if the
virtual boundaries have been narrowed to a proper subset of the buffer) begins
with <CR><LF> and the cursor is between characters 2 and 3 (i.e. at the
beginning of the second line, after the <LF> at the end of the first line), and
one does a Control-B, the cursor winds up between the <CR> and the <LF> that
terminate the first line (i.e. between characters 1 and 2) instead of before
the <CR> (i.e. before character 1).  A second Control-B will correct the
problem.  Note that the problem will not be immediately apparent until one
tries to type something in because there is no distinction in the screen
display between being between the <CR> and the <LF> at the end of a line and
being at the beginning of the same line; once one types something in one will
discover that a ^M and a ^J have suddenly appeared around what is being typed
in.  Control-X = will accurately describe the (incorrect) cursor position.
Has anyone else ever noticed this?

Re:   New libraries

I have installed the sources to the following libraries on [XX]EMACS:.
I didn't bother to make :EJs, and FTP flaked out so I couldn't also
install them on MC.

ADA 26	  This is a somewhat modified version of ECC's (and EAK's?)
          Ada library.  I don't remember all of what I changed, but
	  it included improvements to the indenter and the template system.

MMAIL 87  I rewrote the display support to use my MWind
	  multi-windowing library instead of hacking around with the
	  old window system.  One of our local users had a complaint
	  with the old redisplay (something to do with 2-window Dired)
	  and I figured it was easier to rewrite than figure out.

XPAS 8	  This is a new library I wrote, largely based on the Ada
	  stuff, to implement a Pascal mode.  I know, there already is
	  a Pascal mode, but I wanted it to do things my way...
	  The indenter is a little smarter, and instead of having
	  umpty-ump commands one for each template to insert, there is
	  just one - you type the start of the Pascal statement, run
	  this command, and it fills out the rest of the verbiage that
	  Pascal wants you to have.  Not as customizable as the
	  standard Pascal library, though.

    I think the program you want is CHSEND, which uses the Chaosnet, on which
    EE is located.  SEND is for Arpanet sites and probably (I think) will not
    work anyway because it hasn't caught up with the NCP to TCP transition.

I don't know what this is doing on EMACS-HACKERS, but:
SEND (the version available from MRC:<MM> on Score) works for both TCP
ARPAnet and for Chaosnet.  And for Pup, but you don't care about that...

Do M-? M-$.  It says
   ...
   If a Spell job does not already exist, create one and give contents
   of Spell Initialization as additional JCL.

You can create a Spell Initialization variable by putting the following
into your EVARS file:
   Spell Initialization: LOAD <HUDSON>SPELL.DICT

From EMACS when using ISPELL (Correct Word Spelling), is there a way to
automatically reference a set of ISPELL program commands to load a dictionary
so that the the initialization commands do not have to be typed whenever
ISPELL is initialized?

Thanks,

Subject: What does a HOOK look like?
In-reply-to: Msg of 21 Sep 1983  08:32-PDT from Norm Samuelson <Samuelson at SANDIA.ARPA>

A hook is a variable containing TECO code that gets run by the macro
that sets MACRO mode (or whatever) for you.

To set Comment Column to 40 locally, you want the hook to contain
"40m.lComment Column" (that's a real escape, if it doesn't come
through on your mail reader).  M.L is like M.V except that it makes
the variable it sets local to the buffer it is set in.  In this case
the variable is already local but it's good form to use M.L anyway.

So, to set the hook from an EMACS.INIT file the following line should do:

@:i*|40m.lComment Column|m.vMacro Mode Hook

Like most users, I know just enough about emacs to get my normal
work done.  I find that I need to know one more thing that I have
not been able to figure out for myself.


When writing MACRO code, I want "Comment Column" to be 40, not 32.
If I set "Comment Column" in my emacs.init file it affects some
modes, but NOT Macro Mode.  I assume from this that the initialization
for Macro Mode sets Comment Column to 32.  I further assume that to
change it I need to have a "Macro Mode Hook".

If my assumptions are right, can someone tell me what such a hook
looks like?, and if my assumptions are wrong, can someone tell me
how to do what I really want but dont know enough to ask?
