Subject:  output of labelled messages
To: BUG-babyl at MIT-MC, feature-babyl at MIT-MC

When I output labelled messages to a file, I often want to remove
the label they are being selected on.  This way, I can earmark a
number of messages for output to a file, and then write them all
at once, but not have the "earmark" transferred to the other file
along with the message.

P.S. This is particularly useful when the file the messages are
being written to must be accessed via a network.

how about calling it "Babyl R CC To" since it's for when you reply and

Re:   Babyl ideas

Leonard,

A couple of non-urgent ideas for Babyl:

1. It seems ridiculous to me to have the default on ^S be to search
forward from the current message.  Almost always you want to search the
whole file, unless a subsequence is specified.  Several times already I
have done ^S searches and almost panicked when the message I was looking
for didn't show up.

2. A ^S mode that searches only the From field (or only some other
field) would be a big win.  Searching through all of the text in a
100-message file is awfully slow.

Re:   Babyl L

I have been using the new L for a long time in Babyl' and don't like it at
all.  I have a high frequency of doing Lfoo<return> because I'm so used to
completing readers that complete on Return. The current L also has the
annoying feature that if I have a defined keyword Foo and i type foo, then
foo ends up in my modeline instead of Foo.

Could you consider reverting L to its old meaning and making 0L do what L
does now. The frequency of making new keywords is smaller than the frequency
of typing existing keywords. It makes sense to have the user do minor extra
work for that case, no?

Re:   Babyl L

I happen to like the new feature of being able to make new labels with L.
I agree with you in not liking unambiguous abbreviations not being completed.
If I want to add a new label that is a prefix of an old label I can always
use Edit Labels List.  The capitalization sounds like a bug; perhaps there
should be an option variable to control the remaining behavior.

There is actually exactly, precisely that.  The completer has new
hairiness I hadn't heard about.  If & Read Babyl Label binds the
variable CRL Non-match Method to 4, then Return will force
completion before returning the label, and beep if it can't, and
Linefeed will return exactly what has been typed so far.

I think this may satisfy everyone -- what say you all?

Also things like "Remailed-Date:, Remailed-To:, Remailed-From:".  I'm often
logging in at 1200 or even 300 baud, and often these headers take up a lot
of time in display and redisplay and I really have no desire to plow

I just want to add one thing to what Gail said:

You probably should not try to eliminate Reply-To fields from
sight.  Instead, only eliminate those fields which can ALWAYS
(i.e. unconditionally) be eliminated.  The Reply-To case you
mention needs pretty careful checking -- knowing that RU-GREEM is
the same as GREEN.

Keep in mind that Babyl uses the Reply-To field when constructing
a reply, and if you don't see the field, neither does Babyl.  The
visible header is always the one used by Babyl when parsing
fields.  (Except, of course, when reforming the original header.)

should babyl  not do  redisplay  if you  forward a  message?   for

putting me back to the top of  the message (note that it tries  to
save redisplay by not showing me the new header), but upon exiting
the forwarding  process, babyl  kindly puts  me back  where i  was
(towards the end of the message).  what i'm proposing is babyl not
even put me back to the top of the message (no redisplay at  all),
and let the user do that if s/he wants to edit the message  (don't
many messages have the comments at  the end anyway? or else,  they

No, not in general as a command argument.  Once in the reply
edit, you can use standard window commands, e.g. C-X 1 (^R One

I imagine you can use hooks, e.g. Babyl Command Hook or Babyl R

I think this is a bad idea, as there are many user-names that represent different
people depending on the host.  The only case where I might prefer this
would when the person is local user.

If the personal name could be determined, it would not be unreasonable
to not show any user-name in the from field, though I would not personally
prefer this.  If this suggestion is actually implemented, I would like
to see a user option to turn it off.

Between MIT-OZ, MIT-XX, and the ITS machines, there is a notable
frequency of user-name conflicts.  I think it is a much worse problem
for the Internet as a whole.

If the information is not alread in the header, in which case I really
like seeing it, the only way to get the user names of local people
would be to query the Inquire database on that machines.  Since there
is no TECO interface to the database, and since it would be painful
and expensive to invoke one, I would be unhappy if such a feature were

That wasn't the impression I got.

I don't care whether the host name is in there or not if it's my
own host, but if it's from another host, it had BETTER be there!
For example, GREEN at KESTREL is my boss.  GREEN at SRI-CSL is
Milton Green, and GREEN at MIT-MC, even though my boss has an ID
up there, is not my boss, but Frederic Green.

If I got a message from just GREEN and I never saw host names,
I wouldn't know which one of these guys sent me mail.

I vote for host names.

    If I got a message from just GREEN and I never saw host names,
    I wouldn't know which one of these guys sent me mail.

"..never saw host names..."  Aw c'mon.  We are just talking about the
Survey output.  Whatver style you choose for display of the actual or
reformed header and text will still show you what you want to see.

    Re:   SASW's Request

    This discussion has gotten out-of-hand.  I think all that is
    reasonable to want is to be able to see something reasonable in the
    Survey lines without having most of the From->To field taken up with
    host names.  I would vote for that much - especially to have it remove
    the residue of my host name when the msg is from me!  I think that was
    all SASW was asking for in the first place, leaving the header itself
    alone so you could see the original of reformed version with enough in
    there for the Reply function to work - or did I read this all wrong?

    I can't see why you think a survey output that lies to you
    about who a message is from is of the slightest use.

You're getting incomplete (not false) information either way.  Right now, I
almost never get to see all the recipients in a survey, except for local
messages.  With uucp senders, I don't even get to see the sender's name.  The
other way, you would wouldn't see the sender's host, but you'd have more
context for the message as a whole.  It would certainly be a useful option to
have.  Presumably you wouldn't set it if you have name conflicts among your
correspondents or you care where people are logged in when they send their
messages or you have a wide screen.

In any case, it would be nice for babyl to parse uucp addresses and cut out the
crap in the survey (say show "!foo@relay", with a ! to indicate that routing
has been deleted).

Are people aware of the Babyl Survey FROM/TO Control variable?
Or is it inadequate?  (It doesn't handle uucp names, I know, but
other than that, how is it?)  Or is this discussion just
attempting to argue what the right default value is for this
variable?

(Setting the variable to 5 causes the hosts to be eliminated from
surveys.)

Actually, if people really care about handling uucp names, they
can try experimenting with setting this variable to a macro.  I'd
like to hear about what they come up with, if they try this.

Subject:Autolabeling anyone?

I would find the autolabeling feature more usefull if it would make an
attempt to complete the strings it found in the subject field, and also
expand the abbreviations.  For example, I have a label
"cm = Connection Machine", and I would like a subject like 
"{cm} More Flaming" to label the message "Connection Machine" and not just
"cm" like it does now.  Also "{connec}" should be enough to give the full
label.  Even the full "{connection machine}" should get me a message with
the capitalized label.  

If it can't coerce the subject into an existing keyword I see several
possible ways to deal with it.  Some of them are probably wrong-headed, but
perhaps a switch should control it:

1.  Leave the subject line alone.  

2.  Label the message with that string (as is done now).

3.  Label the message with that string and silently add it to the labels
list.

4.  Label the message with that string and query the user if he wants it
added to the labels list.

5.  Query the user if he wants case 1 or 2.

6.  Query the user if he wants case 1 or 3.


I would prefer 6 myself.

Could we have the "b" command accept negative arguments?  Thus, -1b
would mean to survey the previous message, -5b would mean to survey the
5 previous messages, and -zb would mean to survey all the previous
messages.  It would be O.K. with me if the survey was in reverse order.

This would be more convenient than jumping back several messages to get
the survey, both because it takes less time and because you won't get
unnecessary redisplay of the survey's "base" message.  It would also be
more consistent with other commands which take negative arguments.

I think this would be helpful, and sounds easy.  Did you know
that you can actually already do what you want (though not as
tersely) by giving two arguments to B?  E.g.  73,75B will survey
messages 73 through 75, without first going to and displaying 73.
However, it does leave you at 73....  I guess, then 73,75B75J is
more in line with your intent.  In any case, I will look into
providing the -nB, which is certainly clearer.

I think this is a GREAT idea!  But, I think it would be nicer, and more

I think Steven's idea of 'lines left' based on Hagerty@CMU's request for
'n chars left' is a great idea. However, there may not be much room in the
modeline, esp. for people who label their mail. It should be at least
available on a character command? In which case, it would give you the # of
lines left, and (to save you a simple calculation) how many screenfuls that
corresponds to in the current window size.

If that were possible, then I would also vote for a preview line - a B
of the next message... it could be placed on the line ABOVE the

confuse this by treating it as a window...

In fact, the MODE2 library implements more than one modeline. And with the

Subject: Survey command args.

Comments, opinions, and suggestions solicited, concerning:

I have a few changes to Babyl that I've collected this past week,
and one includes extending the B (survey) command to take
negative arguments.  In conjunction with this, it had been
suggested to me that B and the other survey commands be made more
uniform with respect to their arguments.  Right now, they are
inconsistent:

      B surveys the current message.
     4B surveys 4 messages, starting with the current message.
    -4B surveys the 4 messages preceding the current message.
   3,7B surveys messages 3 through 7.

but

    ^SU surveys all the unseen messages after the current message.
   n^SU surveys all the unseen messages in the Babyl file.
	(For any explicit n argument.)

What do people think about making the survey commands take
arguments like B, with perhaps the no-argument case meaning
something different?  Perhaps the no-argument case for B could be
changed to be consistent with the others.  For instance, how about:

      B  = survey all messages from the current one to the end.
    ^SU  = survey all unseen messages after the current one.
   n^SU	 = survey next n unseen messages.
  -n^SU  = survey preceding n unseen messages.
 n,m^SU	 = survey all unseen in range message#n through message#m.

This gives, as special cases:

     1B  = survey the current message.
   1^SU  = survey the next unseen message.
 1,Z^SU  = survey all unseen in file.
   Z^SU  = .,Z^SU = ^SU = survey all unseen from point.

I think that no matter how we make these argument conventions
consistent (and clean), it will be an incompatible change.  I
expect people will need some warning, to check for hooks that may
call survey functions, so we can't jump into this.

While you're hacking babyl, could you add a feature, perhaps not defaultly
enabled, such that M,R and F check whether the mail buffer is non-empty and
modified and if so, ask you if maybe you really want to continue editing the
unfinished message instead?  I just got screwed by this again (I ^]'ed out of a
long almost finished message to look something up, then spazzed and typed F
instead of ^F).

This depends on the modified flag getting cleared when something is mailed
off successfully, which I believe was true the last time I looked.

At the very least, these commands could at least save the old message on
the kill ring rather than flushing it without a trace.

Or maybe instead of using the kill ring, let them have their own ring, so
you could do, say 3,C to continue editing the third message back (the
post-comma numarg to C is already taken).

Gene,

Clearly the lack of a letter shouldn't preclude the short form.  Since
there are so many UN-things, I would suggest:

    ^SD    = survey deleted
    ^SUD   = survey UNdeleted
    ^SL    = survey labelled	(reads a label)
    ^SUL   = survey UNlabelled  (reads a label)
    ^SS    = survey seen
    ^SUS   = survey UNseen

    ^SF    = survey, finding string	(reads a string)
    ^SUF   = survey, w/o finding string (reads a string)

Re:   automatic mail sorters

(if these mailing lists no longer exist and someone is reading this -
 please let me know.  Thanks. TWF)


I'm working on a project involving user-constructed mail "filters".
What we would like to build is a rule-driven expert system which will
ORDER one's electronic mail on the basis of the message attributes.
We don't want to actually filter out unimportant messages, just rank
the current (or incomming) ones.

The kinds of attributes we are imagining using are things like:

  - has the message been read?, header seen?, answered?
  - age of message
  - sender's identity (e.g. RPG@SAIL), address (BBNA), local vs. network
  - keywords in subject field and message body
  - apparent "type" of message body (e.g. pascal code, lisp code,
  - manner we became a recipient (e.g. only addressee, one of several
    addressees, as a member of a mailing list, a carbon copy, forwarded...)
  - size of message
  - etc.

We expect to rank messages with along several dimensions, such as
INTEREST, URGENT and IMPORTANCE, and then have rules which combine
these rankings to produce an overall ordering of the messages.

A crucial aspect to this project would be to provide an environment in
which it would be easy for the USER to examine, understand, specify and
modify the rules which drive the system.  We are aiming for a class of
users which includes those technically oriented but having no
programming knowledge of experience.  We might, for example, allow
rules like:

   if the sender is TIM.UPENN@UDEL               ; this fellow sends very 
      then INTEREST is VERY LIKELY to be HIGH    ; interesting messages.

   if the RECIPIENT is a MAILING LIST            ; if the mail is not personal
      then URGENCY is LIKELY to be LOW           ; then it's prob. not urgent.

   if the source is LOCAL                        ; local (non network) mail has
      then the IMPORTANCE MAY be HIGH            ; many important messages.

   if the SIZE is > 200 LINES or the TYPE is PASCAL ; very big messages and
      then the URGENCY MAY be LOW                   ; programs aren't urgent.

   if the URGENCY is > MEDIUM and the IMPORTANCE is NOT LOW ; rank from other
      then the RANK is VERY HIGH                            ; measures

I know that there has bee a fair amount of work in the area of
automatic mail filters, routers and the like.  I'm interested in
getting pointers to people, projects and relevant publications. I'd
also like to talk to people who have to deal with a large number of
incomming messages (e.g. > 20).  I would like to know how they manage
the task of reading their mail (old and new) already and what features
they would like to see in an mail-sorting expert system.

I would greatly appreciate any information, advice or ideas you could
give me.

Thanks,

What a mess!  To get my people going, I have them use a dumped EMACS
and dumped BABYL, rather than each having his or her own
customizations (for now).  I found the best way to handle it all is to
put all the directory and personal names in a "subfunction" and set it
from there - a big waste of space, plus I have to remember to change
it every time a new user comes on board and redump everything.

Now, I notice that MM apparently read the FINGER database to get the
names (I haven't check with the open file trap turned on to see, but
it's a good guess), or the username is hidden in the exec somewhere...
Anyway, I was hoping that maybe something can be done to have Babyl
read this file and set the default value of Personal Name, while still
allowing the user to set it otherwise...  Perhaps, if the file is a
text file, the name to be read can be placed in a variable also,
making it more univerally usable...

For those of us who sometimes use slow terminals (<1200 baud) it would

just types the survey line of each message, waiting in between for you
to type D, T, etc.  Then you casn go back and just read the messages

will involve incompatible changes, I'm pretty sure, so I wanted

Do you mean these are header field but their header field labels
don't end with a colon??  That would be illegal, and I haven't
seen one.  Do you have a sample header with one of these?

In any case, the header processing (parsing, reformation....)
will probably fail on things not recognized as header field
labels -- or more likely, the label will be taken to be a
multi-word thing up to the first colon; e.g. in

ID For Whatever Purpose:  12345

the header field label would be "ID For Whatever Purpose".  If
this is the case, you CAN include that in Babyl Reformation
Flushes These Fields.

One final note, re your first message, in which you asked whether
you can flush headers that START "Resent-".  No.  You have to
spell out the complete label.  But there are only a few of these.

Subject: New survey arg convention

There is a new Babyl installed on ITS, OZ, and XX.  It has new
survey commands which have a consistent argument convention.

Since this will be an incompatible change, and since no one (but
me) has yet actually seen and commented on this convention -- it
is different from what I proposed several weeks ago -- I am
giving the Feature-Babyl community a chance to try this out and
comment before any general announcement is made.

The new survey arg conventions are not used by default:  you have
to specifically say you want them used.  This allows us to make a
graceful transition through this incompatible change.  (In
particular, several people may need to change some hooks that
call survey commands.)  To use the new survey arg convention, you
can do one of the following two things:

1.  Set the variable  Use New Survey Commands  to a positive
number.  (0 or negative means don't use the new commands.)  When
Babyl is loaded, it will check for this variable and install or
de-install the new survey commands.

2.  You can switch back and forth by M-X Use New Survey Commands.
(Give it a 0 or negative arg to go back to the old commands.)

Describe Use New Survey Commands to see the general argument
convention.  Or, describe any particular new survey command,
e.g. (to Babyl):

X DescribeNew Survey Deleted Messages<return>

Of course, describing different M-X New Survey... commands will be
pretty boring, but that's the idea.

Subject: Survey args and hooks

A word or two more on the choice of the survey arg conventions:

I desired to make the argument scheme be as consistent as
possible across the different survey commands we have, as long as
it seemed convenient to use and had simple semantics.  Yet, I was
very conscious of the implementation difficulties.

For instance, I considered having  m,n<survey command>  mean
survey selected messages within the range message#m through
message#n.  However, this appeared to require major and/or
difficult changes to the low level survey and mapping functions.
In addition, it would mean that sometimes arguments are message
numbers and sometimes iteration counts.  On the other hand,
having it mean survey n selected messages starting at message#m
was easy to do (fitting well with the low level mechanisms) and
seemed to have a kind of consistency -- the n<survey command>
part always specifying an iteration count.

As for ease of use, I did wonder whether people would like the
case of no-argument meaning "survey over the entire file".  I
liked the simplicity of it, myself -- M-X Survey All Messages did
just that.  And using it for a few weeks, I found it no trouble.
But, I did experiment a bit with using Babyl Command Hook to
change the no-argument meaning -- provide default arguments.
This seems easy, so if you do want to make the no-arg case be one
thing for B, and another thing for the other ^S... commands, you
can do it.  The hook's documentation should provide details, or
contact me.

Steve,

I have negative arguments explicitly defined and working only for
certain survey commands -- in particular B (maybe only that one
-- I forget).  So, -3B will survey the three messages before the
current one, and z,-3b will survey the three before the last one,
not quite the same as z-3,zb but close.  (Difference in whether
the last message is surveyed.)

There is generally great trouble handling message RANGES given
the underlying mechanisms.  The basic thing needed is a starting
message number and a (forward moving) iteration count.  This is
easy for -3B since B surveys all messages, but is hard for -3 M-X
Survey Deleted Messages, say.  So, I've decided that although
-3<survey command> will always do something, it will only be
defined for certain commands, such as B, and they will mention
the negative arg in their documentation.

How does that sound to you?  I realize it is not ideal, but for
me the question is -- is it a good compromise?  (Useful, clear,
implementable.)

    into the commands wouldn't be too far off the mark.

Sorry, I didn't make that clear.  I had indeed considered having
something like that, but considered it too obscure in terms of
what you actually see:  If you say (in the current scheme) 3^SD,
you will see the next 3 deleted messages after the current
message surveyed, if there are that many.  I wanted -n^SD to
survey messages BEFORE the current one, but if we take the
proposed translation of .-3,3^SD, you could well see 3 deleted
messages surveyed, NONE of which is before point.

For that reason of obscurity, I decided not to have that behavior
defined for ^SD.  I will say, however, that it will DO precisely
what you ask: -n^SD will indeed turn into .-n,n^SD.  But it just
isn't documented, and therefore not guaranteed against changes.
On the other hand,  -nB is defined to survey the n messages
before point, and it works by translating into .-n,nB.  It is
compatibility with -nB that makes -n^SD become .-n,n^SD.  (There
is a subroutine, & Survey Args, that is used by all the survey
command functions;  it takes the given arguments and returns a
validated  <start-message#> and <iteration-count>.)

To sum up:  Yes, I do what you ask, but I don't want it defined
in a tricky (and possibly someday hard-to-support) way, so I only
have the documentation mention negative args when they do
something "reasonable"  -- i.e. only B (= M-X Survey All Messages).

It would be nice if BABYL could generate and understand the two fields that
allow for mail programs to understand conversations, namely ``In-Reply-To:''
and ``Message-ID''.

If a user elects to use In-Reply-To in his headers when replying to a
message, Babyl should construct such a header and fill it in using the
following steps:

  If the original has a Message-ID field, use that as the contents.
  Otherwise, use
    The message of <date of original> from <from of original>
  as the contents.

There should also be a way to insert a Message-ID in the message just before
the message is queued, if the user elects to do so.  The usual contents of
such a field looks like <[host].date.username>, where host is the full name,
the date is something like 12 June 1982 16:59:59 (not that the exact format
matters so much), and the user name is the name associated with the job (not
any Babyl variable).

Even if Babyl could not make full use of these features (well, maybe there
could be a Survey Conversation command or something like that), having those
headers around would make the conversation concept a lot more useful for
others who use programs that can exploit it better (like Hermes and ZMail).

"0,."?  This is in line with ^U in emacs (which it would also be nice
to have -- I'd like to do ^Ub).

Is this very hard?

Subject: automatic arguments

First of all, note that the survey commands are changing,
effective next weekend or so.  You can try out the new
versions by giving the command M-X Use New Survey Commands.  In
particular,  "B" (or any no-argument survey command) will apply
to the entire file, i.e. "1,ZB".  And "-ZB" will be (is already,
actually) equivalent to "1,.B", not that it is all that much
shorter, but some might well prefer it as more convenient.

As to your other comment, about having a Babyl command character
that meant some special range, e.g. "1,.":  I'm not convinced of
it well enough to put it into Babyl now, but you can easily make
such a Babyl command as an extension yourself.  (And I'd be
interested in hearing how it works out.)  For instance, you could
put the following into your EMACS.INIT file to create the ^U
command:

@:i*| qMessage Number:\[1	!* 1: Message number as a string.!
      !* The global Q5 holds the Babyl argument string: !
      :i5 1,1		!* 5: Set arg to 1,. !
      0			!* The 0 value tells Babyl not to!
				!* flush the argument.
      |m.vMM # Babyl ^Uw	!* Create the function.!

@:i*|C# Sets Babyl numeric argument to be equivalent to 1,. range.
      |m.vMM ~DOC~ # Babyl ^Uw	!* Create the documentation.!

As I try this out now, I'm not sure I'd say ^UB is easier to type
than -ZB.  But you can experiment.

Re:   Suggested feature

I have several hundred labels at this point.  In order to manage them,
I keep them in alphabetical order, and consequently must use M-X Edit
Labels to add one (after first finding the right place to stick it
in), rather than simply using Linefeed after typing a new label to the
L command.  With more than two screens of labels, and a 1200 baud
connection, this gets painful quite quickly.

A very useful thing instead might be to have Linefeed insert the new
label in the right place, alpabetically, rather than simply appending
it at the end.  Problems with this:
	o  If the list isn't already alphabetical, this can lead to
	   inconsistent results, unless the first use of the new L
	   command orders the existing list.
	o  It may take substantial runtime (but, given that the list
	   is already in order, it's only a matter of finding the
	   correct spot to insert the new label, which is fairly
	   easy).
	o  People may not want this to happen.

So my suggestion might be to implement this, if not by default (I'd
rather it was the default, but others might not), to allow this
behavior to happen if the label command is given a positive argument
or somesuch.  Possibly whether this happens should be controlled by a
variable such as Babyl Insert New Labels In Label List Alphabetically.

I don't know enough about TECO and Babyl to do it myself for my own
copy, and it could conceivably be quite useful for many people.  Would
it be possible to implement this?

Thanx much.

This doesn't sound like the sort of thing that should go into
Babyl now, given the uncertainty of its applicability to the
Babyl community in general, and the limited hacker power (I'm
trying to concentrate on my thesis and generally shy away from
feature requests).  However, you should be able to have a very
simple (and very fast!) command that will sort the labels list;
you'd give this command, after typing Linefeed to create a new
label.  I'll send you such a command in a separate message.

Is there any way to specify to Babyl the header fields I would like to
RETAIN, rather than get rid of?  I know I can eliminate header fields,
but it seems like other network sites are competing with each other for
most-original-field-name or something!  If it isn't "resent-foo", it's
"redistributed-from", or "via", or something else!  Also, is there a way
to tell Babyl that single blank lines should be counted as part of the
header?  Every *MSG message appears with about 12 lines of header, and
the only interesting part (to me) is the sender name and subject.  And
endless UUCP routing information appears just after a single blank.

Frequently I have wanted to start up a babyl, reading in my babyl file, but

Which reminds me.  It looks to me like Babyl doesn't implement the

It would be nice if there were some way to survey messages of ALL

BAR, BAZ, FOO (alphabetic), then you get a survey of all BAR's, and
maybe a blank line, then all BAZ's, etc etc...

Babyl seems to forget that % is a host-name separator character, and
fails to remove the host-name when that option is set.  In particular,

      INFO-COBOL%mit-mc.arpa  ==>  INFO-COBOL

Also note the ".ARPA" appendix, which should be recognized and removed.
(Actually, it would be nice to remove *all* domain-names, either always
or under control of an option.)

It would also be nice if Babyl would recognize and remove gateway
names, such as in this address:

      INFO-COBOL%mit-mc.arpa at csnet-relay.arpa

It should be possible to pick out a half-dozen common gateways (e.g.,
csnet-relay, rand-relay, and ucb-vax) and check for addresses of this
form, so that the survey field have some actual information in them.

This is infuriating!  The blank (line 4) wipes out anything I do to
process the header to remove unwanted fields.  This problem is
especially bad for *MSG messages (which have a pseudo-header created
for them) and for UUCP messages (which have innumerable "Received:"
lines in the header).

How can I stop this result?

I wish I had a good suggestion for you, but I don't.  The only
thing I can think of is that you play around with various
heuristics for recognizing when (and what part of) the message
text is in fact a message header and maybe merging it with the
real header.  I can't volunteer, since the thesis deadline looms
(May 11, I think).  Also, I'm not very confident this can be
solved in a nice way.

One further thought, possibly helpful for such heuristics:  Babyl
maintains a bunch of header-field variables and you might use
them to help tell whether the first word of a line (when followed
by a ":") is a header field.  These are (1st case) named by the
field and a colon, e.g. the var qSubject:, and (2nd case)
COMSAT ... FIELD, e.g. qCOMSAT AUTHOR FIELD.

Is there a way to have a "last message" command which moved to the
last message before the most-recent command.  Thus, 1jL = go back to
message #1, then return to where you were before.  The reason is,
sometimes when reading messages in a Babyl file where many of the
messages are deleted, deleting one more will move semi-unpredictably
around the file (since I don't remember what's deleted and what's not).

Thank you.

    I have come to believe that Babyl doesn't do the right thing with
"Resent-" fields such as "Resent-To:" when making a reply.  It seems
that they are being ignored.  I often get headers that look like this:

    Resent-From: SPICE@cmu-cs-spice.arpa
    Resent-Date: Thursday, 31 January 1985 21:34:17 EST
Babyl's reply to this message would be like this:
    To: Kai-Fu.Lee at cmu-cs-speech2.arpa
    Cc: spice at cmu-cs-spice.arpa
    Re: LISP / Typescript Questions
In this case, the other people on the "Resent-To:" list never see that
I have replied to the message.

    I think that what should be done is to effectively treat the
Resent- fields as extensions of the normal fields.  In this case, the
other people on the Resent-To list would get cc's, since they are
virtually on the To list.  

    RFC822 says that Resent- fields take precedence over the normal
fields.  There is also a note which suggests that the information in
them should not be mixed with the normal fields.  If you obey their
suggestion here, then the only person that doesn't get the reply is
the person which originally sent the message, which would clearly be
wrong.

Re:   Killing messages by subject in Babyl

Frank, the usenet mail reader "rn" at Brl-Tgr has a "k" command that
marks all messages with the current message's subject in the current
newsgroup as "read" (effectively killing them for you).  Is there a
similar command in Babyl?  I'm getting tired of reading those ATT vs
HZ100 benchmark discussions in Info-Micro.

A further feature in "rn" is "K" which not only kills them but also
writes that subject out to a unique file (in your directory) for that
newsgroup so that anytime you use "rn" it knows to kill those subjects
(neat eh?).

[My apologies to anyone who gets this twice.  I think COMSAT is

get a large cross section of people quickly, since ECC, the most
likely one to answer this question, hasn't logged in since April.]

I'd be interested to know if Babyl has some way of implementing two
more hooks.  I want a hook to run a particular function just after
Babyl reads in a file (either on startup or after an I command), and a
hook to run a particular function just before Babyl files out (either
because of a Q or another I...  etc.).  In the former case, I want to
automatically snarf in the "most recent" set of labels from one of two
files, and in the latter case, to sort the labels list before it's
written out.  (I have both of these macros already written, but no
automatic way to call them.)

Can I do this in any convenient way in Babyl without generating a new
release that has these hooks in it explicitly?  If necessary, of
course, I can write my own slightly altered versions of the
appropriate functions, but I'd rather not if there's a more elegant
way...

Thanx for any help you can provide.
