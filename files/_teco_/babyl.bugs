To:   bug-babyl@MIT-MC

The documentation for the F command advertises a 3F command that remails a
message.  (This is new, right?)  Firstly, its self-documentation seems to be
confused (or confusing) about whether it is 3F or 1F.  Secondly, it seems
to produce bogus headers.  I remailed a message from COMSAT@MC to Alan@MC
to myself on OZ, and the un-reformatted From field looks like:

From: Communications Satellite <COMSAT> @ MIT-MC

which Babyl itself cannot parse.  Yes, I use header-reformation.

    For example, when I try to use BABYL, I get the message that the files
    it needs are still archived, which isn't the case.  AAA, also does not

In-Reply-To: Your message of 7-Sep-83 2033-EDT

Well I think this is how it works...

In DEC's model, "archiving" something means to make a permanant record
of it on a tape somewhere. This tape file is then considered the canonical
one, and if you bring the file back to disk then the disk version is
just a more usable representation of the one on tape. Thus, the disk
version of an archived file is constrained to be unchangable as long
as the tape version continues to exist. If you want to modify an
archived-then-restored file, you have to copy it to a new file or
generation number. If you want to unarchive something completely,
use the "archive" subcommand to delete.

Reply-to: Foner at MIT-ML

I have several hundred labels at this point.  In order to manage them,
I keep them in alphabetical order, and consequently must use M-X Edit
Labels to add one (after first finding the right place to stick it
in), rather than simply using Linefeed after typing a new label to the
L command.  With more than two screens of labels, and a 1200 baud
connection, this gets painful quite quickly.

A very useful thing instead might be to have Linefeed insert the new
label in the right place, alpabetically, rather than simply appending
it at the end.  Problems with this:
	o  If the list isn't already alphabetical, this can lead to
	   inconsistent results, unless the first use of the new L
	   command orders the existing list.
	o  It may take substantial runtime (but, given that the list
	   is already in order, it's only a matter of finding the
	   correct spot to insert the new label, which is fairly
	   easy).
	o  People may not want this to happen.

So my suggestion might be to implement this, if not by default (I'd
rather it was the default, but others might not), to allow this
behavior to happen if the label command is given a positive argument
or somesuch.  Possibly whether this happens should be controlled by a
variable such as Babyl Insert New Labels In Label List Alphabetically.

I don't know enough about TECO and Babyl to do it myself for my own
copy, and it could conceivably be quite useful for many people.  Would
it be possible to implement this?

Thanx much.

how to get the mailer to identify me more clearly in the 
FROM fields of mail that I send. What I'd like is something like:
      From: Glenn A. Iba <x.gai@oz>
but it seems that all that's getting there now is simply x.gai which
is not very descriptive. is the problem that my inquir file is set
up for gai and not x.gai?? I'm still sufficiently confused about the
ramifications of having a subdirectory account that I don't see how
to sort this out. 

   Thanks for any help or suggestions,
     Glenn

p.s. while i'm on the line here ... i'd like to also put in a request
for a slight revision to the "Edit BABYL options" command in BABYL. It
seems that it would be helpful (certainly to me) for this command to
not only print out the "typical and safe" choices, but to also show
what the CURRENT values are so that one can confidently leave parameters
unchanged without worrying about accidentally modifying their current
values. Something to consider for someday if its not too much trouble
to implement. Thanks.

It is an ITS mailsystem bug that it does not treat multiply-nested "%"
properly.  Because of the general losingness of "%", one must assume
that these routes will pile up after sufficient replies; consequently
one must be willing to handle such things.

ITS mail maintainers: The bug is that MIT-MC's mailer fails to understand
that MRC%SU-SCORE%MIT-MC@MIT-MC = MRC@SU-SCORE.  The problem is that it
transmogrifies to MRC%SU-SCORE@MIT-MC alright, but then fails to transmogrify
further; it tries to parse MRC%SU-SCORE as a local address.

I believe the Author field ought to contain just a user name. The

in the FROM-UNAME field. It suggests that some day it might work to
put more than one user in that field or to put full hairy syntax there
but that for now this doesn't work.

I haven't looked in Babyl to see how hard this is to change. I'm CC'ing
this to BUG-COMSAT in case someone feels like upgrading the mailer 
and saving us the trouble of changing Babyl but if we don't hear anything
from the BUG-COMSAT people, we should continue to assume this is a Babyl

    We get so much garbage mail in over the net that has invalid, unrepliable
    From:  fields (from UUCP sites, BITNET sites, and especially recalcitrant
    ARPA sites) that we've changed our local mailer to change the From:  field
    to contain the "envelope from" if it is different from the From:, renaming
    the original From:  to be Unauthentic-From:.  For example:

In other words, YALE takes it upon themselves to munge up message
headers. Sigh, this must be the most popular way to lose in Internet
mail these days.  I think that since in the DoD Internet model the
header is part of the MESSAGE, and NOT part of the ENVELOPE, they
should not be breaking the message seal and scribbling all over the
contents.

There has been alot of discussion over this in relation to the NBS
model, which I understand makes clearer distinctions between envelope
and contents. (I haven't read it yet.) In the Internet though, there
is either no envelope, or maybe the transport mechanism (SMTP)
dynamically creates and uses the envelope as the Return-path.

    As far as incompetent mailers go, I notice that Info-Vax messages still
    come out with the old non-standard Remailed- headers instead of the 
    standard Resent-.

Ellis is correct here, RFC 822 (section 4.1, page 17, Message
Specification) says the field called "Resent-From".

    Also, Burke's to Meehan contained an address with invalid syntax; the
    new standard does not allow "."  in personal names unless it is enclosed
    in quotes.  

    Instead of:     From: Glenn S. Burke   <GSB @ MIT-MC>
    It should read: From: "Glenn S. Burke" <GSB @ MIT-MC>
    or:             From: Glenn S Burke    <GSB @ MIT-MC>


I am not sure if Ellis is right or not.
I think RFC 822 (section 6.2.4, page 30, Domain Dependant Local
String) says that                  <Glenn S. Burke @ MIT-MC>
is illegal, and that it should be  <"Glenn S. Burke" @ MIT-MC> .

But we are not talking about the mailbox name -- we are talking about
a comment included in part of the field.  Since we can unambiguously
parse out the legal net address by the brokets, I am not so sure if
comment quoting is required. I believe KLH does not think the quoting
is required in that part of the field, and that RFC822 is buggy if it
says otherwise.

Just looked a bit closer at rfc822 myself.   This is a "mailbox" (p 27),
-> "phrase route-addr".  If you track down the specification of phrase,
you find it should not include special characters (pp. 10-11), unless
they are in quoted-strings.

I'm trying to get to some BBOARDS from babyl and seem to be failing.
I used ^A to set my BBOARDS to stuff like AP-NEWS, and I thought that
^B would read these for me, and it indeed displays the names of the
BBOARDS in my switch.ini file, but does nothing else.

How do I read these BBOARDs?

Also, if I want my message header to look nice, i.e. include my name

Dan,

There is currently no alternate file name for SWITCH.INI though that could be
added.  I don't understand your problem with interference between programs
though.  All programs using SWITCH.INI expect the name of the program name  to
be the first atom on any line in the file.  Since the BBOARD lines all begin
with BBOARD, all other programs should just ignore them, just as the BBoard
subsystem of Babyl should ignore lines intended for other programs.

Subject: Keywords
To: BUG-ZMAIL at SCRC
Cc: BUG-BABYL at MC

In ZMAIL in Release 4.5, site configuration 61, on Lisp Machine Keith Moon:

The Zmail "L" command is quite inconsistent with the Babyl "L" command.

1.  It does not recognize abbreviations as defined in the Bably file's
Labels list.

2.  It does not allow you to just add a single label, it requires you to
retype every keyword the message already has.

3.  Completion is not available.  Typing L followed by Complete acts
like the Complete key is the Meta- prefix!?

Nobody but a Babyl user would use the L command, so shouldn't it be
consistent?


While I am on the subject, it would be nice if Zmail (or Babyl) were to
have a command that did a GC on the Labels list somehow.  Perhaps
querying the user with a menu of keywords it sees that you aren't using in
the babyl file anywhere for potential flushage.  This would help keyword
users like me from accumulating tremendous menus of keywords in Zmail.

I started a Babyl in my emacs on OZ.

I used the "^F" command to find a message I wanted to save.
I tried to use the "O" command to move that message to my Bably file; I
typed just "OALAN.BABYL<return>".  Babyl created a NEW babyl file named
ALAN.BABYL containing JUST that one message.

I didn't suspect I was losing until I tried to use the O command again and
the default I was offered was: <ALAN>ALAN.BABYL.-1.

I'll guess that this has something to do with the fact that I bind Babyl

	If I receive a message that needs filling (let's call it
message 9 in my file), and I read the message, and then fill it, and
then delete it, and then expunge the file, and then...

	I leave babyl, but the fork stays around, and then...

	I receive another message and continue babyl, and it reads the
message, and it is now message 9, and then...

	I try to fill it (it=the new message 9), it says that I
already tried to fill this message.  in fact, this is a new message.

I'm not sure what trouble you're having.  I tried using your
SWITCH.INI, and ^B works for me.

I'm afraid you've hit a sore spot regarding the info file -- I
haven't yet made the BBOARD info merge into the BABYL info file.
Those commands so recently updated as you noticed only include
commands in the BABYL library proper, not including the BBOARD
library.  I will look into fixing this.  In the meantime use
the EXEC's @HELP BABYL-BBOARD or type "?^B" to Babyl.

    Also, if I want my message header to look nice, i.e. include
    my name rather than my username, what do I do?

I'm not sure what you mean here.  In the message I received from
you, here is what the header included:

    From: Adam G. Mellis <DVW.AGM%MIT-OZ at MIT-ML.ARPA>

As long as you have the variable Babyl Personal Name set, Babyl

New Babyl files on OZ, ML, MC, and XX, e.g.:

XX: PS:<EMACS>BABYL.EMACS
XX: PS:<EMACS>BABYLM.EMACS
XX: PS:<INFO>BABYL.INFO

Babyl changes (BABYLM, actually) involve correcting an oversight
on my part:  I only recently became aware that RFC822 requires
more quoting in the personal name field.  For instance, if
periods are in the name, quoting must be used, as in:

    "Eugene C. Ciccarelli" <ECC at MIT-OZ>

or many other variants, including:

    Eugene C\. Ciccarelli <ECC at MIT-OZ>

So, in view of this, when Babyl parses the recipient fields in
outgoing mail, it may add quoting to the personal name field.
In parsing for header reformation, however, it will REMOVE
quoting around the personal name in most cases (it is
conservative).  Thus the first example above would get the
quoting removed, and so Babyl users should not in general notice
the change.  (They will if they have reformation turned off.)

Also:  The Babyl INFO node now has command and option
abstracts for the BBOARD library too, following those for the
BABYL library commands/options.

(I could always un-reform the header if I really wanted to know
what address the sender used.)  Is there already some feature
that does this that I don't know about?  If not, can someone send
me a TECO macro for it?  (I would write it myself, but I'm not
sure whether there's some structure to headers that I have to be
careful of.)

P.S. Thanks to whichever maintainer brought back "(mail queued)"!

P.P.S. Perhaps this would also fix my having to tell Babyl not to
reply to both of DCB and DCB%MIT-OZ?

Note that the header fields are still reversed. That's a COMSAT bug which
I would still muchly like to see fixed, but it doesn't get confused about
the References information.

The convention for these request files, in case you've forgotten is
    LABEL:<text-to-end-of-line><crlf>
or
    LABEL;<char-count><crlf>
    <possibly-multi-line-text><crlf>

where <char-count> is in octal (or decimal if followed by ".")
and should not count either the crlf after the "LABEL;<char-count>"
or on the last line of the the text (counting that <crlf> will tend to
force a double-<crlf> in the header area, something COMSAT doesn't 
check for as it forms messages, and make the header area end prematurely).

I fixed & ITS Mail Buffer in BABYLM to use the COMSAT request file format
which specifies a character count for an item rather than making you have
to put USER-HEADER: before each line.

I tested this fix and wrote it back out to EMACS1;BABYLM 154. I did not
put a compiled version on EMACS; though since I didn't know what the 
release procedure was. Could you maybe check my changes (they are pretty
simple) and install this? Thanks.

This fix will get around the major effects of the COMSAT bug which reverses
USER-HEADER fields in message formatting, but CStacy says he will try to fix
that bug sometime soon anyway.

Subject: Multi-line subject fields
To: BUG-BABYL @ MIT-MC
cc: KMP @ MIT-MC

When you send a message with a multi-line subject field on ITS, the
COMSAT request file comes out with no "USER-HEADER:" quote on the 
stuff following the first line and the COMSAT multi-line item format
(with char count) does not get used.

This bug predates my recent fix to BABYLM source and is not fixed by
that fix. 

The problem is that adding USER-HEADER: was only ever considered for
continuation lines of USER-HEADER: items.

The right fix is probably just to change things so that a bad request
file is formatted (with no quoting of continuation lines) and then
everything up to the "TEXT;-1" line which is indented should be backtracked
upon, changing the item from "FOO:" to "FOO;count" syntax. This would
change "USER-HEADER:..." to "USER-HEADER;nnn<return>..." as well as
"SUBJECT:..." to "SUBJECT;nnn<return>...".

I will probably do this myself one of these days. I note it here on
BUG-BABYL so if someone gets ambitious they can try to beat me to it.

By the way, the COMSAT request file format is documented in KSC;?RQFMT >
on MC if anyone needs a reference.

This bug ONLY occurs if you enter Survey Menu from a message 
other than one in the menu as in          J5,5B'
It does not occur if you do, for example, J5B'
Having entered a "bad" survey, J does not work right for the 
remainder of that survey. Having entered a "good" survey, J
works fine throughout the survey. Somehow, I suspect this is
related to the fancy hacks for speeding up J based on message
number. Perhaps it's something like that Survey Menu (falsely) 
makes the assumption that upon entering the menu, you are at 
some message shown in the menu?

It seems very plausible that recent troubles I've had with my
private extensions trace to this problem. That situation for
Surveys is one I create much more frequently than normal users
would (due to the nature of which messages are selected by
a filter).

I will try to look into this later, but since you know the
code (and IVORY) better than I, I certainly won't object if you
look at it first and/or offer any hints about where to start
looking.

Well, I spent all day reading the Babyl code related to Survey Menu,
# Babyl J, etc. very carefully. I found out two interesting things...

 * The bug I was having in my extensions was caused by forgetting 
   to keep qBabyl Message Number up to date. I wrote some code
   that called # Babyl J before I realized that # Babyl J might rely
   on knowing the current message number in order to win. Anyway, 
   I fixed my code and Babyl is exonerated on this count.

 * However, there is indeed a problem with J in Survey Menu. The problem is 
   near the end of & Jump to Current Survey Line. It makes the assumption that
   if the message number to jump to is smaller than the line we're on but is
   not in the survey, that we should just move back a line. That's what
   makes the right thing happen if the survey contains 20,22 but not 21
   and you type ^D to 22 (it moves to 20 for lack of something better to
   do) ... This sort of works if you assume that the missing number is nearby
   but doesn't if it is far away (eg, 1J from msg 20 in survey of 10:20). 
   An easy patch to the most common case is to watch for 1J (and ZJ) 
   especially and do jl (or zj-l) in that case to get on the first survey 
   line. A more complicated patch which seems more right seems to me to be 
   to iterate over previous/next lines until a line number which is 
   less/greater than the desired line is found and then move back/forward
   over it. In any case, the bug is benign because it only affects where
   SVMenu thinks you are, which doesn't have to be exactly right since
   before you do commands, SVMenu will parse what line you're actually
   on anyway. But it's very visually confusing and does not give the user
   a sense of confidence that his commands are being understood, so someone
   should probably fix this. I might try to fix it myself one of these days
   if someone doesn't beat me to it.

Is there some kind of "Survey Rest" (the rest of the messages after

that ^S^A surveyed all messages from the current message, not all
messages from message 1.  "Survey Rest" would be useful for surveying
bboards, for example, when you didn't want to read all messages and
just wanted to survey those you had not skipped over. Hence at message
15, you'd like to survey all messages (15, <end>] or better yet all
unseen messages in (15, <end>]. Survey Undeleted and Survey Unseen
don't work for this, since they give you all the stuff (from message
1) you've skipped over but not read or deleted.

I fixed & Jump to Current Survey Line to do something that seemed more
reasonable. The source is MC:EMACS1;BABYL 764 and I compiled it to 
ECC;XBABYL for maintainers to try out.

The old behavior was as follows:
 If it couldn't find the line for the message number it wanted,
 it would just blindly go back a line or forward a line (depending on
 if the number it wanted was bigger or smaller). This meant that 1J in
 a survey of messages 100-200 while at message 150 would take you to 
 message 149, which I think was confusing.

The new behavior is as follows:
 If it can't fine the exact line for the message number, it will
 try to find a line which is NUMBERED as close to that as possible
 (not necessarily textually near). It will prefer a smaller line number
 if moving backward or a larger line number if working forward. Hence,
 in the above example, 1J will go to line 100 (regardless of the order
 of the lines, in fact). Also, in a survey of only the odd line numbers
 from 101-199, from line 151, 
   doing 1J   will go to line 101,
   doing 106J will go to line 105,
   doing 196J will go to line 197

This algorithm takes slightly longer to run, but I think not significantly
longer. In contiguous and/or dense surveys (eg, from the B command)
where the exact target line number is likely to be found, it will be the
same speed as before. Only in sparse surveys is this new code likely to 
get used at all, but in those surveys I suspect correctness is worse any 
slight loss of speed anyway.

One important philosophical consequence of this change is that if you have
some survey like this where you have re-ordered the lines:

 No. Lines        From->To        Subject or Text
 14:   22  Blythe@OZ->            {RemindNow} Phone Msg: Call Dr. Liza Sisk
 22:   65  AGRE->                 {Seminar} Wed 30-Nov 4:00 "Problem Solver" !
 17:   88  BAGLEY%MIT-OZ.ARPA->co {Seminar} Cognitive Science Calendar

and you are at msg 14 and type D, it will jump to message 17. Formerly, it
used to go down a line to message 22. If this is an important intended
feature rather than just an accidental consequence of the way the code was
set up, then this "fix" is not correct and should be retracted.

Personally, I find Surveys to be sufficiently ephemeral (you have only
to breathe on the *Survey* buffer to have its contents erased) that I don't
do much line re-arrangement and in most cases where I did do such, I doubt
I would mind the new behavior a whole lot. But that's just my personal 
feeling and I wouldn't want to be accused of pushing my tastes upon others
without asking.

Gene, could you tell me if the high-level description of the changes I
made sound reasonable and -- if you get time -- check over the code itself
and make sure it looks ok? Thanks. --kmp

I don't think the behavior of J should care at all about the
ordering of the survey.  That weird behavior is really D's fault
-- it should be the one to do something other than N in a
reordered survey menu.  So my feeling is that we have as yet made
no stand on or support for such reordering, and so don't worry

argument cases undefined for some commands, because I didn't
think the behavior was clear or reasonable -- it was just what
fell out of the implementation, and I didn't want to tie us to
supporting that behavior.  I also wanted the survey conventions to
be as consistent and simple as possible.

E.g. -nB is documented, but -n^SLfoo is not.  What you've pointed
out is a case I forgot to consider, but which is related.

First, here's what # Babyl B's documentation says:

    Survey all or a range of messages.
    Survey argument convention:
	No argument means survey all messages in the Babyl file.
->	One positive argument n means survey the next n messages.
->	One negative argument -n means survey the previous n messages.
	Two arguments  m,n  mean survey n messages
	    starting with message number m.

while here's what Survey Labeled Messages's documentation says:

    Survey all or some messages with some label.
    String argument is label.  Messages with that label will be surveyed.
    Survey argument convention:
	No argument means survey all labeled messages in the Babyl file.
->	One positive argument n means survey the next n labeled messages.
	Two arguments  m,n  mean survey n labeled messages
	    starting with message number m.

Note the missing line.

Unfortunately the m,n case does not mention whether n can be
negative, leaving open the question of what it means to "survey
-3 labeled messages".  You probably read that as "survey 3 of
them, going backwards".  I think we should simply change the
documentation to read:

	Two arguments  m,n  mean survey n labeled messages
	    starting with message number m.  N must be positive.

Edit babyl options works fine until it gets to the question "Do you
tell COMSAT R-option append?"  It prints the question, then beeps and
echos the error "SFL Search failed."  Hitting another key to redisplay
causes UVN, but things work after that.

also, how about support for the mmailr's AFTER and DELIVERY-OPTIONS? that

Is there a way in Babyl to have a copy of my outgoing messages
automatically appended to a Babyl mail file?  The only way I can think
of doing this is to add a default CC field, and use the O command when
the message gets back to me.  This does not seem like a desirable way
to save outgoing message.

    In Release 5.0 [GC'd Beta Test rev 3], dusty plum, on Lisp Machine Jim Morrison (3600):

    After sending the bug about the packet allocation problem I S-B'd to recompile the file.
    I then got hit with the standard VMS problem of the connection getting hopelessly
    confused when file transactions abort.  The BIN file that was in progress got closed
    instead of aborted so that when I did a neti:(progn (reset) (enable)) (which is forced
    once the connection gets confused) and a (make-system .. :compile) the file did
    not get recompiled as it should have since an apparently up to date (but bogus) bin
    file was there.  Since the bugs here all seem to be at the VMS end of things and 
    they've been around for a while I'd like to know what is going on to fix this.
    Did someone here not install the lastest software or have we not received it?

A blow-by-blow description of the entire tragedy:

This morning I logged in, ran gmsgs.  I then ran babyl.  It typed out
"checksum error" or something like that and then valretted an :INPUSH.

I killed that off, started up an emacs, loaded babyl and zbabyl, and
read started a babyl in the emacs.  It read in my mail file.  The mode
line said I had 38 messages.  I typed ' and the emacs died, printing
"undefined macro name" endlessly, and responding to nothing but CALL.

I killed that emacs off and gamely tried again (running babyl inside
an emacs).  This time it worked normally, but printed (no new mai)
when starting up.  I was now at message 25/25.  My mail file had been
eaten.

I looked and there were no leftover output files.  So, at cent's
suggestion I'm gonna refrain from using GMSGS.  I hope this rather
boringly detailed account provides some debugging info.

I cannot figure this out.  When I try BABYL.EXE on XX or running
it from within EMACS there, it seems to work.  However, I am not
using your Babyl file -- perhaps that might have something to do
with the problem, though I don't know what, offhand.

Can you try a few things for me?

First, does the error occur before Babyl types anything at all?

Try setting your Babyl files invisible, e.g.
    @set file inv *.BABYL.*
and then run @BABYL and see whether you get the illegal memory
read before Babyl types anything (e.g. telling you that you have
no Babyl file, and asking whether to create it).  If it gets as
far as the question, just ^C out and reset the job.  Then set
your files visible again, e.g.
    @set file vis *.BABYL.*

In your EMACS, try just loading BABYL:

    M-X Load LibraryBABYL

and tell me if it complains at that point.  Then if that worked,
try:

    M-X Describe& Setup Babyl Library

and see whether that works.  If it does, check that the version
of BABYL it is using is 762.

We could make GMSGS perfectly safe, without having everybody mail messages

<hsname>;<xuname> GMSGS and read those messages in along with those found
in <hsname>;<xuname> MAIL.  (GMSGS already has a switch to cause it to
write out such a file.)

Other than doing that, I am unable to design a perfectly safe way for
GMSGS to insert system messages in a MAIL file, without running the risk of
colliding with COMSAT accessing the same file.  (With the cooperation of
COMSAT, that it.)  Perhaps some clever use of %DOWOV-mode?  

I'll bet 20X GMSGS has this same problem.  Note that people only lose when
they run GMSGS at \exactly/ the wrong moment, so it is fairly hard to have
this happen.

This is not a feature or misfeature of Babyl. It has to do with the way
c-X 2 works in Emacs in general. Most people I know of who use two-window
mode in Babyl do not intend to do editing on other than the *Babyl* and
*Survey* buffers, however, so I'm not clear that your proposal would not

I checked the source. You're right about this. The obvious fix you suggest
is possible, but we might want to do something else.

I have various routines in ZBabyl (m-X Set Start Date, m-X Set Stop Date,
m-X Set Expiration Date, ...) which are willing to work on the header of
either a message in a Babyl file (when bounds are narrow to that message)
or on the header of a message in the *Mail* buffer. I have my own routine
that does something like 
 f~Buffer Name*Babyl*"n ...use & Bounds of Header...'
			"e ...use B,{start of Header/Text separator}'
It might be harmless to build this directly into & Bounds of Header,
perhaps conditional on a precomma arg of some kind if efficiency were a
question. This would allow Edit and Mail Buffer to use & Bounds of Header
as a subroutine.

No, you really cannot get RMail-style (stack) deletion in Babyl.
You could get a cheap version working that just deals with the D and U
commands, I'd think.  E.g. have a Babyl Command Hook that checks if the

little stack.  If U, before executing, it pops the stack and jumps to
that msg.  Not general, but maybe useful for you.  (Not general, since, e.g.
you can delete in several other ways, e.g. labeling or K'ing.)

Subject: "Error in Edit Babyl Options"

A while back, back just before MC died for a long while, and
before the vacation, you reported seeing a UVN error at the
completion of Edit Babyl Options.  I finally got around to
looking into it.

It really isn't an error -- it is just a spurious message.  That
is of course a bug, but not a UVN bug.  There is some strange
interaction between errsets, throws, and Teco's top-level catch (@<...>)
or something.  Your Babyl file has an option that Babyl doesn't
recognize, though it doesn't really care.  It finds that out with
something like:

      1:< q2uBabyl 1 Option >w

This quietly ignores the UVN error that happens within that
errset.  However, this (the & Reset Babyl Options routine) is
being called during the exit from Edit Babyl Options -- it is an
unwind handler.  Edit Babyl Options is throwing a 0 value to the
top level Babyl command loop, but I think somehow that catch is
getting a non-0 value, the UVN message.  I'm not sure about this
last bit, but I know for sure that both Edit Babyl Options and
its unwind handler & Reset Babyl Options are both exiting, not
aborting part-way through.

Anyway, until this is cleared up, here's what you can do:  First,
you might as well delete GUMBY;BADBAB ECC, since I now know how
to reproduce the error.  And second, whenever you want, do an
Edit Babyl Options and just ignore the message...

Twice lately I have used the OUTPUT LABELLED MESSAGES function
of Babyl.  Each time, it asked if it should remove the label
and also if it should mark the messages as deleted, both of
which I answered yes to.

After the file was written (I assume, because I haven't looked
yet), I looked at a Brief, which showed the messages still
labelled and un-deleted.  This is not what has happened to me
six or eight months ago, when last I used this function.

The problem was not as I reported it.  

I was using the abbreviation that I have for the label in the
label list.  I am almost certain that it used to work, since I
use longish labels and HATE to type.  I'm certain that I would
have remembered.

Using the full label seems to have worked.

    I note that if there is a Reply-To field, Babyl replies only to that
    and not even to the CC list. Do you know if that is an official (or
    unofficial standard) use of Reply-To or is that just some arbitrary
    decision that you made when you had to decide what Reply-To meant?
    That sort of thing should be somehow agreed upon. I suppose MSGGROUP
    or HEADER-PEOPLE are the only people who really exist to do that...

I checked my (draft, I'm afraid) version of RFC822, and it says:

    For systems which automatically generate address lists for
    replies to messages, the following recommendations are made:

	- ...
	- If the "Reply-to" field exists, then the reply should
	  go ONLY to the addresses indicated in that field and not
	  to the address(es) indicated in the "From" field.
	- ...

    ...

    This recommendation is intended ony for automated use of the
    originator-fields and is NOT INTENDED TO SUGGEST THAT REPLIES
    MAY NOT ALSO BE SENT TO OTHER RECIPIENTS OF MESSAGES.  It is
    up to the respective mail-handling programs to decide what
    additional facilities will be provided.

So, first note these are *recommendations*, and second note that
we get our choice.  I vote for not asking anyone outside the
Babyl community, but just deciding this on the basis of Babyl
consistency.  I think Reply-to takes the place of From, and so we
should have R reply to Reply-to with CCs to To and CCs.  1R
should reply to just the Reply-to.

    should reply to just the Reply-to.

I actually prefer the recommendations of RFC822 for the following reasons:

 * It is extremely important (in regards to Randy Davis's gripe last
   week) that there be a way for a sender of a message to advise
   mail readers of the entire intended return list. This is useful for
   polls ("How many users do X?"), and requests for info. It is simply
   not realistic to expect people to heed a PS that says "reply only to
   me, not the whole list"; experience says such notes are frequently
   ignored.

 * We already have a way to over-ride only the From field: by providing
   an explicit From field. ie, if I write

	From:KMP
	To:BUG-BABYL
	--...

   when in a Babyl on someone else's console, it will come through as

	From: KMP
	Sender: FOO
	To: ...

   and it darned well better not reply to Sender: ever.

So if you make Reply-To: do what you are suggesting, it will be both
redundant and less featureful. I'm sorry I was so unclear in my previous 
message, but my purpose was really to point out that it does a good
thing and that the thing it does should be advertised as a useful 
thing for people to do to reduce extraneous mail traffic.

In fact, maintainers should make a practice of putting Reply-To fields
on their INFO-xxx messages so we wouldn't have to have special case 
little tables of mailing lists we find ourselves irritated by people 
replying to.

If there is to be any other behavior (as in 1R or something), that should
be the case of getting more people; but that, I think, should not be 
the default. The default should serve naive users to protect them from
embarrassment and others from irritation.

I agree with KMP about this; Reply-to: should be the only thing

I would be extremely annoyed if the existence of a reply-to field reversed
the meanings of R/1R.  I don't care which does what, but don't want to have
to carefully scan the header for a reply-to field before deciding whether
to type R or 1R in order to get what I want.

I would vote for the following mods:
1. Provide a Babyl Reply To All flag which determines the meaning of R/1R
   Could have these meanings:
     1 = R replies to all; 1R replies to From/Reply-to only.
     0 = R replies to From/Reply-to only; 1R replies to all.
    -1 = R replies to all unless there is a Reply-to field in which case
	it replies to Reply-to only; 1R replies to From only, unless there
	is a Reply-to field in which case it replies to all (or whatever the
	KMP proposal is).
2. Provide a ^R mode command, maybe -1 C-M-Y, which adds any missing
   recipients to the header, basically letting you recover to the reply-to-all
   state without aborting the message.
3. Change the default of Babyl Reply To All from 1 to 0.   I believe that
   is the situation in RMail and nobody complains all that much.  It's the
   right thing for novice users, and others can get what they want by setting
   the flag.

    I would be extremely annoyed if the existence of a reply-to 
    field reversed the meanings of R/1R...

If you re-read carefully, you will notice that my notes suggest that the
status quo is correct since it correctly implements the standard. ECC's
note suggested the current implementation might not be appropriate, but
CStacy and I believe he is just confused.

In any case, I didn't intend this to be a proposal for immediate change
and am not interested in hairing up the Reply control switches at this 
time. I simply sent Gene some mail questioning whether certain things were
defined in the standard.

The problem is not one of mail readers so much as mail senders. Until it
is made clear what it means for someone to send a message with a reply-to
field in it, Babyl (or any other program) cannot hope to do the right 
thing with it.

My only point in CC'ing it to Bug-Babyl was to record a private 
conversation, not to open a controversial discussion to the group.

A problem with CC lists is that they, too, are ambiguous in intent.
Perhaps R should grumble when people try to reply to messages
that were not addressed to them?

Just a thought.

It has to do with redisplay.  If I'm in "'" survey mode, and I look at
a message I haven't seen before (i.e. its status is "-"), when I
return to the survey the status character hasn't changed (e.g. to
":").  Since you know what message is being operated on, you can tell
which line of the survey buffer needs changing.

Also, if I'm in "'" survey mode and I accidentally hit a "e" the
survey vanishes but I am still in the *survey* buffer.  The only way I
can exit is via q.  Is tere another way I haven't hit upon?

As far as I know, typing Space exits an empty survey.

What did you mean by looking at a message? The T command? The T command
in two-window mode turns - to + (or :), but the other T command doesn't.
I suspect this has to do with a fear that you really haven't seen the
message because you might have flushed the T too soon. I'm only guessing,
though. Also, there is the problem of nT which shows only some lines of
the message. What fraction of a message need one see before marking it seen.
Since nT doesn't work in 2-window mode, that's less of an issue.

I, too, would prefer that T always mark a message seen even if you've only
seen a little piece of it. It's simple enough to mark it unseen again from
Survey Mode if you care to.

My opinion is that the 1-window survey menu T should also remove
the unseen label.  We haven't ever claimed that our unseen label
is maintained with any semantics strongly resembling the
real-world interpretation...  E.g. "unseen" is removed in
2-window T even if you just look at the first half-window's worth

    I got an URK in BABYL, and while Make Space was running,

This is a bug in the Babyl standalone mode. The problem is that there are
many nested errsets and though one errset caught one error, the unwinding
process probably caused another URK which was not caught until an outer
errset which was not really intended to catch such things. The result was
that Babyl exited normally and when Babyl runs in standalone mode, normal
exit is supposed to kill it. If this behavior bothers you (it can't lose
mail; it can only lose a few D's or an unfinished M or such as that), then
call Babyl from inside Emacs instead of standalone. Trapping URKs is *very*
hard; trapping PURs is even harder... I guess you know you're lucky things 
run at all when you're out of address space. I'm sure there are any number 
of programs that don't do even that well...

Sorry this is so dense, but I wanted to record as much state as I
could before I forgot it...

I was in the process of replying to a message.  I wanted to look at a
file so I foolishly did C-X B to select Main, and then C-X C-f to read
the file.  Fine.  I then did C-X R to continue my BABYL.  This worked
OK; I was viewing the message I had been in the process of replying
to.  I tred "C" to continue sending mail, but it said "You are already
sending mail."  So I used the minibuffer to select the buffer *Mail*,
and continued editing my mail.  When I was done, I did C-C C-C to
exit, and got the error "No BABYL OPTIONS in FILE" or something like
that.  It continued to display the text of my mail, but the modeline
claimed I was viewing the origonal message (the one I ws replying to).
I exited babyl temporarily, then restarted it with C-X R.  It now
showed me the correct message (the one I was origonally replying to),
but claimned that that was message 0/0.  I deleted that, and it showed
me the next one, claiming that it was message 1/0.  I typed "E",
figuring that it might clean things up,  but that changed the mopde
line to say that I was viewing message -4/-4.

The moral?  Don't change buffers randomly, I guess.  I'm amazed babyl
did as well as it did.  Is there a command that says reparse the
entire buffer (I was assuming expunge would do that)?

Dave,

The mistake was not using ^X^F in the first place, and then simply ^XB
to select the *Mail* buffer again.  The reason is that you were
already in a recursive edit mode under BABYL.  However, by doing ^XR,
you "recursed" a second time rather than pop a level to continue the
BABYL you already in.  By starting a second-level BABYL, the hooks
left from the first level did not allow you to Continue, since you
were still "sending mail" as far as it was concerned.  By then, you
were already too deep in the nesting to actually try to send.

If you had Quit or ^X'd that second level BABYL, then selected the
*Mail* buffer, you could have picked up where you left off and sent
that message under the first-level BABYL, and all would have been
"right" again.

What is the problem with your Babyl file?  I took a look at it,
and your mail file, tried reading them in Babyl.   The
structure of the files and the operation of Babyl works fine for
me.  The only slightly out of the ordinary thing I see is that
your directory has a [TECO].OUTPUT file, which is an earlier
version of your Babyl file.  That probably means Babyl or EMACS
or the system or something crashed while writing out the Babyl
file.  But that old version doesn't have anything in it that
isn't also in your more recent DRogers.Babyl file, so I would
say, just delete that [TECO].OUTPUT file.

If you still have trouble, please tell us in more detail what the
symptoms are, the scenario that recreates the problem.

Yes, I agree that what HERMES does is consistent.  However,
I don't want to remove the forwarding entry in the data
base, because it is necessary (or used to be) to get around
a Twenex lossage of getting notified a million times about incoming
mail.  I think Babyl just ought to be fixed not to barf on these.

Btw. It is not so winning that HERMES makes the Reply-to: field
indirect through MC (i.e. <JMiller%MIT-OZ at MIT-MC>) even for local
mail.  Babyl wins better on this.

I would like to do some teaching again at some point (it has now

        that fouls up babyl...

    Yes, I agree that what HERMES does is consistent...

No. If I understand correctly from your descriptions, what HERMES does 
is not correct.

The address

   *PS:<RICH>MAIL.TXT.1@MIT-OZ 

is not in valid RFC822 format. It is fine for such an address to be in
the mail database on OZ because that database can define whatever format
it wants, but it is not fine for HERMES to pick up things in that format
and put them in a mail header. The reason is that "<" and ">" are 
reserved markers such that in

    Joe Luser <LUSER @ MIT-OZ>

only the LUSER@MIT-OZ part will be seen as an address. To quote the
<...> so it is not interpreted in this way, 

    "*PS:<RICH>MAIL.TXT.1"@MIT-OZ

must be generated by HERMES when it resolves the addresses. 

Personally, I think it is completely bogus for HERMES to be putting
the resolved addresses in the header. Fine for it to want to resolve
this info for the purposes of sending the mail, but not fine for it
to put that resolved info in the header. If, for example, you were
sending to INFO-FOO and that resolved to RICH which resolved to 
*PS:<RICH>... and you put the *PS:<RICH>... in the message header,
then people are going to later reply to there, preempting Chuck's
ability to either remove himself from INFO-FOO or to change where
mail to RICH goes.

Considering how your babyl file is over 200 pages, you're lucky that it
still fits into babyl at all.  You should try to clean it up while it still
fits.  For example you could sort it out into several babyl files based on
topic using the O command.   The X Output Labeled Messages command is also
useful in this context.

My reaction is that it isn't a Babyl bug, though perhaps you
could argue that it is a lack-of-feature:  Babyl does not check
that you (or the original header) provide a valid host name.  The
name CU20B is not in the host2 table.  The best that Babyl could
do is just what the mailer did -- tell you that it doesn't know
that host.  The real problem is that a message went into the
Arpanet without a From field that could be replied to.  For
instance, when Babyl sends a message from OZ to somewhere outside
the local area, it will produce host names like %MIT-OZ@MIT-MC,
in an (ugly) effort to make the message repliable.

This is infuriating!  The blank (line 4) wipes out anything I do to
process the header to remove unwanted fields.  This problem is
especially bad for *MSG messages (which have a pseudo-header created

Babyl seems to forget that % is a host-name separator character, and
fails to remove the host-name when that option is set.  In particular,

      INFO-COBOL%mit-mc.arpa  ==>  INFO-COBOL

Also note the ".ARPA" appendix, which should be recognized and removed.
(Actually, it would be nice to remove *all* domain-names, either always
or under control of an option.)

It would also be nice if Babyl would recognize and remove gateway
names, such as in this address:

      INFO-COBOL%mit-mc.arpa at csnet-relay.arpa

It should be possible to pick out a half-dozen common gateways (e.g.,
csnet-relay, rand-relay, and ucb-vax) and check for addresses of this
form, so that the survey field have some actual information in them.

Perhaps you (and we) can get some more info if you type a
question mark immediately after the error occurs.  This will
cause you to be put into the EMACS debugger, Backtrace, and you
will see the cursor showing where the error occurred -- e.g.
you'll see the cursor after the failing search command, for
instance "s^_".  That will tell you what it was searching for,
in the above case a "^_".

Now type (to Backtrace) a "B".  This is the command to show the
buffer at the time of the error, with the cursor at the point
from which the search started.  That should tell you where to go
in the Babyl file in order to fix up whatever's broken, or
perhaps the message that is causing trouble.  The direction of
the search is forward for a command like "s^_" and backward for
"-s^_".

To get out of the debugger type C-M-Z and a "Q".

If the damage to the Babyl file is not obvious, feel free to send
a portion of it to us and we'll take a look at it, or point us to
a file that we can FTP.

    This is infuriating!  The blank (line 4) wipes out anything I 
    do to process the header to remove unwanted fields.  This 
    problem is especially bad for *MSG messages (which have a
    pseudo-header created for them) and for UUCP messages (which
    have innumerable "Received:" lines in the header).

This is not a Babyl bug. The difference between these messages and 
messages which have un-indented yanked messages in them are not
mechanically detectable in any straightforward way. The definition
of a header is the text up to the first blank line.

    How can I stop this result?

Ask the person who does the (re)mailing (or who maintains the 
program which does) to use a more rational header format.

That's not a bug, that's a feature!

You are allowed to edit your survey buffer. You can rearrange the lines,
you can c-K lines you didn't mean to survey or are done surveying, etc.

The general rule is that control chars do their editing function and
self inserting characters do their Babyl function. If you want a command
like c-W to work in Survey mode as a Babyl command, use c-Q c-W. There
is one exception: c-D behaves as a self-inserting character (ie, runs its
Babyl function). This is handled by an explicit special case in the code.

You might make a case that Return should be treated as a self-inserting
character even though it is not (it has hacks to optimize use of existing 
blank lines after the cursor to minimize redisplay) and perhaps it is also
deserving of a special case. I dunno. Personally, I always flush arguments
with c-G.

In ZBabyl, you may find other commands like c-Q c-X useful for getting 
the ZBabyl c-X comtab to do things like set start and expiration dates, etc.
Beware, though: since you are running inside a c-Q, c-G is turned off and
quitting out of commands that prompt can only be done by over-rubout.

I won't claim this is an ideal interface, but it basically works and is
predictable if you know the rules. Good luck.

--End Second Lossage--

It looks like this morning Babyl inserted all of my new messages in the
MIDDLE of the RemindNow label on the first message in my old file.  I
retrieved my babyl file as it appeared when I logged in from backup tape
and it is now sitting in MC:CRASH;ALAN BABYL1.  The broken file that Babyl
wrote out after digesting my new mail can be found in MC:CRASH;ALAN BABYL2.

I am sending this to Bug-ZMail because ZMail was the program that wrote
ALAN BABYL1 last night when I went home.  Also, this has happend to me once
before, and ZMail had recently had its dirty little fingers in my Babyl
file on that occasion as well.  Perhaps there is some subtle disagreement
about the format of Babyl files.

It is amusing to note that the message that this lossage tried to hide was
a reminder I had sent myself to use TECO to correct an accident I had with
ZMail last night.

Subject: Problems with & Autolabel Subject Labels
To: BUG-BABYL @ MIT-MC
cc: ALAN @ MIT-MC, KMP @ MIT-MC

ALAN's Babyl file was being trashed in a repeatable fashion. He and I just
spent the last couple of hours tracking down the problem.

& Autolabel Subject Labels does not restrict itself to labeling messages
which are recent. This is a bug in itself since presumably its function
is just to suggest labels and you should be able to modify  that suggestion
later (eg, by removing those labels) without it forcing the labels back.

In any case, this has the bad problem that if it adds or deletes labels
which are not in the "recent" area, then the 0f[vb and 0f[vz done at the
beginning of that macro are violated because the distance from the real
buffer edge to the edge of the recent area has been modified and when the
implicit f]vz and f]vb are done later by the ^\, the buffer bounds get
set back to the wrong thing. Typically, you overrun just slightly into a
message you didn't mean to, and so that little piece of message gets moved
by the ^P  -.  ...  if Append:2 is enabled to a different part of the
buffer making it seem as if the mail was yanked into the wrong place in
the buffer (which is not the case). I suppose if Append:2 is not selected,
this bug may not show itself at all, which may be one reason that this has
not been linked to & Autolabel Subject Labels in the past.

I wouldn't be at all surprised if this accounted for other until-now
mysterious lossages with Babyl. It's worth asking others with trashed Babyl
files whether they use subject labelling, what their append option is, and
if they have recently edited (removed) any labels automatically supplied by
the auto-labeler.

I suggest the right thing is to make & Autolabel Subject Labels work only
across the region of new mail. Failing that, the next best ideas would be 
either to make & Autolabel remember its position by message number or
to have it notice when it is doing labelling and use an FN construct to 
restore the buffer bounds later by a more sophisticated means than 
simple f[vb, etc.

Feel free to send mail to me or ALAN if this isn't a clear enough description
of the problem. -kmp

Should be fixed now.  I edited your file to add a ^L after the
first message's terminating ^_.  Somehow, Babyl or ZMail fouled
up the file structure there, forgetting or losing that ^L.  The
surveyor is a bit sensitive about these things, and when it
found the ^_ not followed by a ^L, it figured that was the end of
the file.

I left the old version of the file around if you want to check
this out, compare it, etc.

No, you don't have to exit the survey.  Or at least I don't --
perhaps you expect the message being displayed to be visually
updated (redisplayed) when you type the H.  All the H or 1H does
is change the message's header.  You have to type an explicit T
afterwards to see the message.  So try HT and 1HT.

Perhaps it would be reasonable for H to imply a T when in survey
menu.  We can put that on our feature list to think about.

As Babyl is part of EMACS, ^T is a character command and not the
standard Tops-20 information command.  Babyl should at least
display the load average for you when you type ^T, and I'll keep
the feature request in mind.  (It is trivial.)

You can only read Tops-20 format mail files.  You need a Babyl
file to be able to edit; you need one Babyl file for each mail
file.  Easy to create:  For example, for mail file FOO.MAIL.1,
to create FOO.BABYL, type (to Babyl):

    X Create Babyl FileFOO.BABYL<return>
    and answer its various questions.  In particular, when it
    asks what the mail file name is type FOO.MAIL.1.

Then, you I to FOO.BABYL when you want to read the mail.  One
unfortunate aspec of all this -- it will not let you read with MM
sometimes, Babyl other times, since MM wants Tops-20 mail files.

There is no very good way to reorder messages within Babyl.  It
is possible, in at least a few different ways, though.  One way
is to O these messages to a temporary file, say TEMP.XMAIL, in
the order you want, deleting the messages from the regular Babyl
file as you do this.  Then, I to TEMP.XMAIL, and O them back to
the regular Babyl file.  Ugh, but possible.

To get your full personal name to appear, set the Babyl option
variable  Babyl Personal Name, e.g. in your EMACS.VARS file, you
might have the line:

Babyl Personal Name: "Steve Strassmann"

My babyl file (v. 196) seems to be missing most of the messages it should

v. 196, be restored?  Is there any explanation for the problem?  You also
should know that after I quit my Babyl this session, I had problems getting
exec to respond.  Even though I got the @ prompt, along with response
to C-c's, C-t gave Babyl i-o wait, and it took several seconds for a reset
babyl (around 10-15) tto respond.  This was with the load average around
3.8 or so.

If my file could be recovered, I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you.

How about this for an added Babyl feature:

A command to append a message to a printable message file.  The
idea is to append together messages with reformated headers in
a file, separated by ^L's, that could be pressified when the babyl
session completes.  To get really fancy, babyl could automatically
pressify (if a flag was set) the file, and delete it, when the user
quit the babyl session. Other flags could set the options used in
the pressify command (ie, the font, font size...). The command could
work like O or ^O, except that it would make a printable file.

I think the case of the missing twenex.:ej.106 is my fault.  When
I FTP'd the various Babyl files over to XX, I think I mistakenly included
the dumped out one, BABYL.EXE.  So it wanted to load in the files
it loads on OZ.  I note that OZ now has twenex.:ej.111.

Sorry.

    From MC, foo@OZ is a legit address, and much easier to read.  Also, I
    get mail at stanford addressed e.g. gumby%su-turing@score; it would be

Subject: Sometime Reply-To: ignored

I am finding more and more of my messages to some non-conventional
address being returned because the message being replied to no longer
contained the correct address in the From: field.  More to the point
is that there was a Reply-To: field that did have the correct address
and it was flushed in the header reformation.

Somewhere along the way I was lead to believe that Reply-To: took
precedence over any From:.

In this case, the message contained:

Reply-To: some name <name%PCO@HI-MULTICS>
From: some name <name@HIS-PHOENIX-MULTICS>

This is from a foggy memory and may not be exact (and I'm almost
certain that whatever left out detail is the real culprit), but the
point should be obvious: the intended and correct address was in the
Reply-To: and the one in the From: doesn't exist (in our world)...

    By the way, there is something strange going on with your mailer.
    Each of the last three messages you sent me has had ASCII delete
    characters in the mail headers.  Some of these get put in the Cc:
    header when I reply, which causes my mailer to abort the reply
    until I fix it by hand.  Other people will likely have the same
    problem replying to you.

I have that problem, or something like it, with much of my incoming
mail.  Certain other addresses, such as Erik Fair and many bitnet
addresses, have the same problem.  My mailer seems to be able to deal
with it, but not fix it.  I have no idea why this happens.  It does
not seem to cause lossage in terms of mail not getting to its
destination.  It definitely happens coming in to me; I do not know
why.  I suspect it is from the outside.

This is the To: header from RLK's previous letter, as you quoted it.
There is an ASCII delete character after the @ and after the ).
Including the comment does no harm, including delete characters does:
the one after the @ sign destroys the host name, and either of them
will play havoc with my local mailer when I try to reply and find them
transported to the Cc: list of my reply, as they are interrupt characters
meaningful to my terminal driver (and most anybody else's, too).

The problem occurs at the sender end, not the receiver end.  It's not a
display bug, the rubouts are really there, it doesn't matter what you use
to read the mail file. The rubouts come into existence (in this case) because
the sender's babyl misparses a host name followed by a parenthesised comment.

Parsing the following header causes "Error parsing in TO: line."  I don't
know if it's legal syntax, but even if not, enough messages are generated
with this syntax that it's worth parsing (after all, babyl parses old ITS
headers).

Apparently this is more Babyl's fault than EMACS's:

The *Babyl* window should never be selected when you do ^R Two Windows;
if a W2 doesn't exist, it ought to be made, and an existing window not
selected - ESPECIALLY *Babyl*, because if you don't notice and read
something into it, and then later try and read your mail, Babyl thinks
it's in the middle of something and naturally dies trying to interpret
your random editings as a Babyl file.

It would seem to me that if the APPEND option is found in the
BABYL-OPTIONS that the default search would be reverse for "|" and
"^S" (or at least a way to accomplish the reverse search action for
^S).  I often need to find the most recent messages from a particular
person in a fairly large BABYL file, and it seems that I can only
search forward from the current message or the WHOLE file!  Did I miss

I agree with KMP that the Append option should not affect the
behavior of | and survey commands.  Since your message does not
mention -|, it sounds as if you weren't aware of it.  I think it
should be useful to you.  Also, the survey commands can be given
arguments to restrict the range.  E.g., to survey the last
part of the file, you can give some argument like
"z*3/4,z^S...", or "z-100,z^S...", etc.

I grant you that surveying backwards would be useful, but back
when I was working on bringing the survey commands into
consistency, I found that too hard to accomplish.

Well, then, I don't know where certain of the things came from.  It
had a TOPS-20 type of mis-generated date (with hyphen before the time

On ITS and Unix, c-Z means to go to the superior, and c-D means what c-Z
does on TOPS-20.  (This includes c-Z in ITS Babyl!  c-C on ITS does what
c-Z does in TOPS-20).  On the lisp machine, there is an END key, and c-Z
picks a lisp window to select.  VMS uses c-Z like tops-20, uses c-Y to
mean what c-C means on TOPS-20, and has c-C mean something somewhat
different.

The character used to mean "END" varies from operating-system
to operating-system, and seldom is related to the individual
piece of mail software.  Clearly, there is no single right
choice about what system to be compatible with.

If we took all the lisp machine users in the world, the "other system"
that this sort of compatibility would be most needed for would probably
be Unix, and would certainly NOT be TOPS-20.  (I am not claiming that's
why it is the way it is).  I think cross-operating-system compatibility
of user-interface is a hopeless morass.

P.S. Note that it is generally NOT wise to flush SENDER unless you
have SENDER and From merged, and even then there are cases where an
unreplyable address is formed.  Case in point are those messages that
come from behind HI-MULTICS...

Well, I for one don't like the machine DWIMing for me; if I didn't
explicitly specify what to delete I the machine could delete something
useful I didn't know about.

At the very least it should be switch-selectable, with the appropriate
caveats in ine documentation.  New users shouldn't get this behaviour by
default.

Legend is the newest film from Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner,
Apple 1984 Ad, etc.)  The fire broke out while filming a special
effects shot.  the sound stage burned to the ground.  The stage was
the "007 Stage" at Pinewood Studios, Iverheath, England, the world's
largest film stage.  Having visited the stage myself, I can confirm
that it was indeed quite large.  It was built for the production of
"The Spy Who Loved Me" to shoot the oil tanker interior scenes.
Since then, it has appeared in Superman I,II,III, Krull and a few
other films.  I don't know how the fire will effect the production
of _Legend_.  The loss of the "007 Stage" is quite tragic.  I don't
know if Pinewood, or their owners Rank Films, can afford to rebuild
it, insurance or not.  I hope that they do.

No, Babyl hasn't been fixed yet for that header.  It gets a NIB
error.  I suppose it should at least give a reasonable error --
the "Null recipient" error it would complain about a line down
(in the code), or something.  This is a tricky patch of code and
problem and I wouldn't want to tackle it until my thesis is done
(August -- we're essentially sure).

How frequent are such headers?  And from what kind of hosts do
they come?  Is there a chance of complaining to the originator?

Gene,

That form of header tends to come from certain non-ITS MIT hosts (not
XX or OZ either) and I think I've seen them from other similarly
obscure places.  It doesn't happen often enough to make an impression.
But I suspect we'll be seeing more of them in the future...

When you say that "BABYL just silently killed itself", do you
mean that the *Babyl* buffer disappeared?  Or was it emptied?
Did Babyl not write the Babyl file out?  (I can't see how it
would empty *Babyl* unless it had written the file back out.)  I
assume you mean at least that control was not in Babyl -- that
you were back at EMACS top level?  Did you try re-entering Babyl?
If things are grim, and you cannot get back into Babyl, you
should probably at least try switching to the *Babyl* buffer and
writing (with C-X C-S/C-W etc.) it out manually just to save your
state.  Maybe best to make a copy of the old Babyl file, but I am
pretty sure that URKs cannot cause the structure of the Babyl
file to be damaged or to lose information.

I mean one second I was saying "N" to "Flush buffer *BABYL*?"  and the
next -- Poof! I was in DDT and had no trace of my BABYL job. I had no
other jobs at the time, and I don't think I had any weird libraries

    Did Babyl not write the Babyl file out?

I had to start a new BABYL and reread my mail, but of course no

I wrote the loader for :BABYL on ITS.  It kills itself upon normal exit
from Babyl.  I believe that the problem is that various combinations of
heavy errors can cause control to fall up to some outer errset and
accidentally exit "normally", faking out the JCL string which then kills
the Babyl.  URK is the most common way to have this happen, I think, and
probably because you may get more URKs in the recovery from the first
URK while you are at a limbo state between errsets. -kmp

There are two cases where Babyl won't write back  changes:
First, if you have read in a Babyl file that specifies an Owner
and you aren't it.  Second, if you have read in a mail file, not
a Babyl file.  That is, some file that has a mail-file format,
not Babyl-file format, such as a MAIL.TXT file.  Babyl's
philosophy is that you read in a mail file (the in-box), make
changes, and file them to a Babyl file, not back to the original
mail file.  The solution is to create a Babyl file for that mail
file.  (You can have any number of Babyl files -- each specifies
its own mail file.)

Do either of these cases sound like what you are encountering?

Your first question says it's asking about "ranges", but then
proceeds to talk about sets (or sequences, if you prefer) of
messages that match some predicate.  Babyl doesn't understand
ranges (by which I mean messages n through m) and probably won't
in the near future.  However, it does have a set capability,
using its labeling mechanism.  (When ZBabyl gets officially
installed this situation will improve.  ZBabyl has a much more
power filtering capability.)

Here's how you could approximate your
example (moving messages from <user> to a file):

First, label all messages containing some string that you think
will best approximate the "from <user>" match, e.g., for messages
from FooBar, attaching some label, e.g., flame:

    M-X Label Messages Containing StringFooBarflame<return>

Then output all messages labeled flame to the file:

    M-X Output Labeled Messages<return>

It will ask for the label, the filename, whether to remove the
label, and whether to mark these messages as deleted.

You might interpose a middle step that surveys the messages
labeled flame, to check that these are the right ones.  If not,
you can trim it further by going into Survey Menu to remove some
of the labels.

Ok, OZ is back up, so here's gripe number two.  WHen I reply
to a msg, and I use text from the original msg in my reply,
the old letter is MUTATED.  Ie, when I'm finished, the  old
letter has large chunks out of it where I used its text.  Is
there anyway that the split window functionality of babyl could
use a COPY of the original in the upper half of the screen
rather than the real thing?

As for Eugene's respons, the "Labelled Msgs" trick strikes me
as kludgey.  It relies on the fact that certain msgs have
certain labels to work.  Also it doesn't address the problem
of string searching in subject lines.  Pointers into the data
which is conjured up by the "b" (headers) field seems like
the answer to me.

(To be honest, I am speaking on what he told me in private before
I mailed to bug-babyl -- I have yet to read his long reply 
in regards my more public "gripe".

Thanks.

When you enter a reply, if you want to yank the message being replied to,
just do c-m-Y. It enters 1-window mode and yanks an indented copy. If you
still want to refer to the original, go back into split screen mode with
c-X 2, but do not modify the message in window 2.

My suspicion is that you have not read the INFO node on Babyl and are not
up on all the documented features of Babyl. I would recommend doing this
before wasting too much of people's time duplicating what's written there.

Here we go again:

With BABYL 765 and BABYLM 168:

We have been receiving mail from a host which uses an alias host name
in the header.  In replying to those messages, MMAILR complains that
it cannot find that host.  Apparently BABYL appends the .ARPA to the
alias, and that form is not in the host table - only primary host
names have the .ARPA trailer...

According to MRC:

    Babyl should always canonicalize host names and never append .ARPA;
    the latter should be part of the canonicalization.  I bet it fails
    to.

I'm confused.  Babyl and BabylM uses "ARPA" in only two places,
first, in & Process Recipient Field as part of an OZ special-case
hack, and second, in & Default Babyl Queuing Function -- removing
".ARPA" for some reason, but in any case that is in part of the
code not used for MMAILR.  So, as far as I can see, Babyl is not
doing anything at all, explicitly, regarding .ARPA -- certainly
not putting them on.  What is it that made you think Babyl was
putting .ARPA on?  Is .ARPA on the message when it arrives, i.e.,
when displayed in Babyl before you reply to it?  (If so, Babyl
just keeps it there.)

As to canonicalizing host names, that would be nice, I suppose,
but I don't see that we can do that.  Doesn't MMAILR do that
anyway?  -- I thought that if I mail to ECC@MC, MMAILR changes
that to ECC@MIT-MC (using the rubout-around-host-name scheme).

Gene,

The case in question was mail received from name@BBNCD.ARPA.  BBNCD is
an alias entry for BBN-CD.ARPA.  Because BABYL left the .ARPA there,
and because BBNCD and not BBNCD.ARPA is in the host table, MMAILR
complained.  (HOSTS.TXT is already too large with the .ARPA used for
the official host names, and it would be unreasonable to add .ARPA for
all the aliases as well...)

The apparent fix is to remove the .ARPA for all cases.

MM/MMAILR use subroutine calls into HSTNAM.MAC.  It would be
interesting to see that code somehow merged into TECO for use by
BABYL.  Then alot of this special-case code in BABYL could be flushed.

    When you do ^X 2, EMACS should never re-use a buffer already in
    existence.  It should make W2 if it isn't there (if it's already there
    then I dunno)...  I get screwed all the time by doing ^X 2 and having
    *Babyl* selected for window #2, and then trying to read my mail and
    having Babyl throw up because there's random garbage in it's buffer.
    Lose lose.

Actually it's a babyl bug -- normally it's good that ^X 2 gets you the
last buffer you had in the second window, I use that all the time.  But
you normally don't think of having a second window of *babyl* just because
you've used babyl, so babyl should arrange it so emacs doesn't think that.
Why don't you report it to bug-babyl...

As usual, I started up Babyl with about 70 messages in my babyl file,
and I'd allowed about 3 days (50 msgs) mail to accumulate.  I don't
know if there were any very long new messages.

Instead of starting up, Babyl asked if I wanted to flush
the kill ring, the *Babyl* buffer, etc. in an effort
to make space.  This seemed suspicious, but I said yes
to everything, even the *Babyl* buffer, no expecting it
to do anything stupid.  But it did NOT continue the Babyl
(I suppose it didn't find enough space), and my MAIL.TXT
file was deleted.  What's going on?  Was Babyl support
on OZ changed lately?

Is there a way to undelete MAIL.TXT in such situations and get the

Fortunately, babyl never really trashes your mail -- it renames it to
^V[BABYL.LEVITT and only deletes it when the babyl file has been updated
on disk.

[BABYL.LEVITT is 1173 *pages* long.  Not even bare emacs can read a file
that big, and neither can MM.  There are two things you can do (assuming
you're not a Teco wizard):
1. Try to read it on a lispm
2. Use the SPLIT Emacs library to split the file up into smaller chunks.
Unfortunately, that will split it at random places, so if you want to
read the split files using mail-reading software (as opposed to just
looking at them in Emacs), you have to adjust them to break on message
boundaries.  This requires some knowledge of the mail format, so let
me know if you need to do this and I'll do it for you.  There really
should be a M-X Split Mail File command in SPLIT...

Awaiting the bug report that will explain what mail loop caused you to
get a mail file that big....

It seems that the problem Levitt is having involves mit-eddie.  I just
dequeued the message at eddie that was being sent over and over again
to levitt.  I think the problem has something to do with the size of
the message.  Eddie was trying to return it to Levitt because of an
invalid address, yet every 10 minutes or so, there is an entry in our
syslog indicating that the attempt to return it failed.  My guess is
that it timed out because of the length of the message (148 kb).

"|" will reposition to the beginning of the current message if there

Re:   quoted names

I've seen this problem a couple of times, including once last night,
so perhaps it's time to talk about it.

Apparently, someone (at SIMTEL20) told their mailer to send mail to
'"Webb Mike"@lll-mfe' with the single quotes being mine.  the mailer,
spotting the double quotes, said "ah ha!  those are not legal, so I
must quote them."  my mailer dutifully removed the quotes of the
quotes, looked at the string '"Webb Mike"' and said "I see no one
here by that name," since none of our names have double quotes.

I guess I just want to start some discussion on what went wrong here
and what we can do about it.  I don't see any reason for me not to
run the destination mail box through the dequoter until it finds no
more quotes, but since I don't control all the names our mail
receiver handles, that means I'm restricting the names other sites
here can use.  On the other end, I can tell our users to give out
names like Webb Mike without quotes, but i assume this will not be
understood by most mailers (although there are still a lot of mailers
that can't handle the quotes, either.)

Re:   quoted names

Yes, the TOPS-20 SMTP sender/mailer (a.k.a. MMailr) will recognize that
an address has "special" characters and will quote the address if so.
It uses double-quote quoting when possible; if not, it uses backslash
quoting (for the really hairy cases).

What could have happened is that the process which queued the mail to
MMailr (which I bet wasn't MM) misunderstood the quote application rules
and applied SMTP quoting to the address in the envelope.  Since MMailr
performs this service, it was done twice.  Perhaps you'll be able to tell
from the message header what mail composition program wrote the message
and its maintainers can be notified.

On a related topic, it's been two years now and people are still using
" at " in addresses (ala RFC 733).  Noted culprits in the PDP-10 world
are DECmail/MS and old versions of Hermes and Babyl.  Something ought
to be done to stamp this old software out!

Re:   quoted names

Mark and Don,

I'm the guilty party who sent the message in question, and I used the
latest version of BABYL to do it.  I also deliberately put the double
quotes around the name "Webb Mike" as I knew BABYL doesn't handle the
unquoted case properly, and MM doesn't handle it (No such local user
as "Webb"), unless the double-quotes *are* used.

However, Mark's analysis of the mis-quoting done by BABYL in the
envelope appears correct.  I will pass this exchange on to the
maintainers.

1. It is unclear from your bug message what exactly is happening,
in particular, how Babyl is being loaded.  It sounds like it is
being loaded from your EMACS.VARS file.  However, your current
EMACS.VARS, at least, does not load BABYL and you do not include
a sample of the file.  Perhaps you mean that you are loading it
by hand, either with M-X Load LibraryBABYL<return> or C-X R?

2. Your entry for Babyl Setup Hook in your BABYL.VARS has a bug:

Babyl Setup Hook: "1MMLoad LibraryBBOARDw
	...m: M.M Mail with template"

The hook contains Teco code, and that second line is not Teco --
that form is only handled by EMACS for VARS files.  I am also not
sure what the intent is behind that second line.  Is it intended
to bind C-M-M INSIDE Babyl? -- if so, you should know that,
unfortunately, the Babyl command processor does not handle C-M-
commands, and doesn't follow that command-binding convention (of
setting the q-register ...m or similar  qregs).

If the line is intended to bind a key within normal EMACS,
outside Babyl, there is also a problem:  you cannot bind an EMACS
key to a Babyl command since that command disappears when Babyl
is unloaded.  UNLESS you will arrange your VARS file to keep
Babyl loaded at all times.  (Which brings us back to point 1
above.)

In summary, we need more information.  First, just try removing
that second line of the hook and see if that helps at all.  Then
provide us with the intentions of the VARS files (as regards
Babyl) and the relevant code from the files or the manner in
which you load Babyl.

Ecc pointed out that my vars file contained a key binding that it
should'nt have (I had thought that the babyl vars file was ignored
when babyl was being loaded from within emacs and hence hadnt
considered that ). The removal of that one line of offensive code 
seems to have fixed the bug.

In CRASH;[BABYL ALAN is a mail file that causes Babyl to err in & ITSify

line ends in "10810;" which looks like a Tenex mail file.

there is mail from a previous babyl crash, tells me what it will do

When I do "F" (forward) to forward a message, and then later do "R" to

Subject: Next RemindNow

It appears that if there are no more messages labelled RemindNow, and
the "error" message is displayed, some characters are absorbed with no
action, such as N.  If the "|" occurs several screens into a message
under the same conditions, the next honored character causes the
beginning of the message to be redisplayed.

Why I mention this is because "|" and "y" are common noise characters
for me.  The "y" causes no problems unless a previous K has been used.
However, the spurious action of a spurious "|" is unacceptable, even
if the "|" would have been deliberately entered.

To: bug-babyl%MIT-OZ@MIT-MC.ARPA


when I tried to read my mail this afternoon I failed to get babyl to
work in any fashion.  when I first started it it read my babyl file
and then tried to read mail.txt.  It responded with a bad header
message.  So, knowing that the mail file had nothing of interest in it
I deleted it, reset babyl and tried again.  No soap, same message.  It
still tried to read the mail.txt file, even though it didn't exist
(deleted and expunged).

then I sent mail to myself and retried starting babyl and it still had
the same message.  The I logged out, sent mail to myself from another
account, logged in and started babyl.  No soap, same message.  Then I
deleted the mail file, and the babyl file, logged out, logged back in
and tried babyl again.  It asked me all the questions as if I were a
new user, then tried to read mail.txt and crapped out again.  At this
point I am sending this message.

The state that babyl gets into seems to be that it hasn't done all the
loading to turn emacs into babyl.  At the point where it stops it has
two buffers main and *babyl*, main is the current buffer and it is
empty.  *babyl* contains the last message of the babyl file but if
saved it contains the whole babyl file.

What happened?  I want my babyl back.

A few days ago, you had a badly structured mail file.  Somehow
the mailer fouled up the first message-length count.  This caused
an error in Babyl's startup.  Since Babyl couldn't finish its
startup, the bad mail file stays around, but named
[BABYL.ROBOT.GML.1.

When you started up Babyl again later, the first thing it tried
to was bring in that mail from the previous Babyl crash.  It thus
bombed out again, and so on.

I have manually edited this file,
<ROBOT.GML>[BABYL.ROBOT.GML.1, so that you should now be able
to start Babyl without any trouble.  I renamed the bad version to
BAD-OLD-MAIL-FILE.TXT.  If no one wants to look at it, you can
delete it -- maybe wait a few days first.

Sorry for the trouble -- these structural defects definitely cause
trouble.

When you reply to FOO@BAR.ARPA, OZ must of course send to "FOO%BAR"@MC
and hope that MC will know what BAR is. Since, HIS-BILLERICA-MULTICS isn't
in the host table on MC (yet), this is probably the source of your problem.
Perhaps COMSAT should have said "host not in host table" instead of 
unknown recipient. Anyway, I don't think this is a Babyl bug.

Steve,

I think the fact that 1g does not delete the mail file is a feature.
Or at least it is given the alternative commands.  The problem is that
the mail file does not specify the owner -- the Babyl file does.  Thus,
since 1g goes around the Babyl file, it is safer to treat it as just
reading in the mail file.  Perhaps there should be another form, which
does delete the mail file.  (It would therefore get around any timing
screws in the deletion.)

Sorry, but I can't figure out what you are complaining of.  That
header looks fine.  I tried typing R to that header, and that
worked ok.  Or are you saying that it isn't just the R command,
but the sending out of the reply that causes trouble? -- e.g.,
when it gets to the mailer?

What's more, I can't parse your sentence, especially the "->" part:

Subject: Bug associated with variable Babyl File Version
cc:   David%MIT-OZ@MIT-MC.ARPA

I use babyl under emacs, and had the following in my emacs.init:
  -1  M.V Babyl File Version
I used this because I wanted babyl to write a new generation of my
babyl file every time it got saved.  However, setting this variable
had an unwanted side effect; whenever I used the O command to write a
message to a file, the default generation number would be -1, and thus
O would create a new generation of a file, rather than append the
current message to the most recent generation of the file.  It seems
to me that it would be a good idea if the O command did not use this
variable to generate its default generation number. (I believe the
documentation says that this variable deals with saving babyl files
(as in the Q or S commands) and does not mention any side effects.)  Is
there some way for O to default correctly, and also for me to get new
generations when I quit babyl?

I tried setting the variable Babyl O Filename, but the generation
number still defaulted to -1 when I used the O command.  I have since
removed the line setting Babyl File Version in my emacs.init, and now
O works correctly.  Is this a bug/misfeature?  Or is there some easy
way to have O default properly?

Subject: RFC 934

A careful reading of the subject RFC (a proposal for message
encapsulation) may reveal a possible conflict with the way Undigestify
now expects digests to be formatted.  In particular, the authors of
the RFC claim:

1.  "At present there is no unambiguous standard for interest group
digests...  Although interest group digests may appear to conform to a
pseudo-standard, there is a serious ambiguity in the implementations
which produce digests."

2.  "Currently (in existing digestification agents), an encapsulation
boundary (EB) is defined as a line in the message which starts with a
dash (decimal code 45, "-").  Initially, no restriction is placed on
the length of the encapsulation boundary, or on the characters that
follow the dash."

There's much more: forwarded and remailed messages are considered
special cases of message encapsulation, as are Bcc:'d messages.  These
deserve consideration as does the proposed scheme for "forwarding"
encapsulated messages, leading to the possible extension of
UnDigestify to handle these cases.

Babyl and :MAIL use different parsing strategies. :MAIL thinks "%"
is synonymous with "@", while Babyl doesn't. The :MAIL syntax you
probably want is:

 :MAIL "Mark_Walcott%Umich-MTS.Mailnet"@MULTICS

The quotes keep :MAIL from breaking the address at the first "%" or "@",
which would then be rejected because

 "Mark_Walcott"@"Umich-MTS.Mailnet@MULTICS"

is a nonsensical address. Personally, I think this is just a bug
in :MAIL, which should scan backward instead of forward in addresses
when looking for the "@" or "%" to break names from machines, but I don't
know how easy it would be to fix the problem.

I'm not sure, but I wouldn't be surprised if that were a feature. Remail
is not usefully different than Forward otherwise. As it is, Remail means
"This mail was misrouted or should also have gone to someone else and
I'm playing mailman" where forward means "This mail came to me and I'm
forwarding it to you `from me' instead of `from sender'". One might
argue that the two should be reversed, but there's a lot of tradition
supporting these interpretations.  I assume this is why Forward allows
you to add a comment, while Remail repackages and mail as-is only.

This would be a sort of kneejerk fix to a more complicated problem.
The problem is not really at the level of CC or To, but of the list
itself. If the sender of the original message had To'd instead of Cc'd
the long lists, extra mail would be generated. Many people don't make
the distinction between To and Cc that your message seems to presuppose.
Also, there might be individuals CC'd who want to get the reply which the
user thinks he shouldn't include. 

In spite of mailer overhead caused by this sort of thing, it's not really
that hard to type "D" to most mail readers to make spurious mail go away,
and it is very hard to find information that got misrouted due to dropped
recipients.

The right solution is to inform users of the importance of correctly
selecting a set of recipients, giving them an understanding of the 
overhead in sending to large lists, and an appreciation for when they
should and shouldn't include such things. I'll grant you that such
instruction is frequently neglected, but it's no reason to penalize
people who know what's going on. Generating spurious mail is, after all,
not generally destructive -- just tedious.

The question of defaults is really completely orthogonal to this. In the
end, it's easier to c-W an unwanted region in Emacs than it is to type
in the stuff that didn't get included (a similar argument to the one I used
above about the "D" key, by the way -- note the pattern). 

Well-meaning various people have, from time to time, made this suggestion 
and it's never been changed, I suspect for reasons like those I've outlined
here.

    Also, some modifier of C-M-Y might allow you to yank in the CC's
    if you decide you want them later.

This part is novel, but would probably be slightly hairy to implement
and probably equally hard to explain to people (I have found many people
to be confused by the use of numeric args as modifiers to commands).
Also, you have to remember to call it. The current behavior has the
advantage of making something visible in the header to remind you that
there were CC'd people.

Of course, we're all crossing our fingers that better mailer technologies 
come along to make these issues moot. Eg, such systems might allow large
mailing lists to more conveniently get screened, or to allow mailers to
at least query the mail system about whether an address refers to an
individual or group, so that it can conditionally advise the user when 
it thinks he may be sending to an excessive number of people... We've
discussed (not necessarily seriously) changing the Dont-Reply-To list 
to something more like Dont-Send-To so that no matter how such mail is
generated (via the "R" command or the "M" command), the user still gets 
queried if he tries to send to certain classes of lists.

I find that the Babyl Undigestify command is unable to deal with the format
of the new Soft-Eng digest.  This could be fixed by changing the Babyl
command or, I suppose, by changing the format of the digest slightly to
more closely match others.  (I don't know what the problem is.  Perhaps it
is the two lines of dashes surrounding the banner?)

     Is it fruitless to hope that someday we might have a mail reader
that combines the best features of both MM and Babyl?  I am one of
those people who has no clear preference for either program, and who
sees the merits and flaws in both.

     Babyl's survey mode is rather feeble.  What I especially miss in
Babyl is the ability to perform the following kinds of functions:

MM>h i fr <string>

MM>h i to <string>

MM>d uns te <string>

MM>r uns su <string>

MM>move <file> uns fr <string>

     What I miss in MM is the ability to step, screen by screen,
through the full header and text of each message, while enjoying at
each screen access to a wide range of compact commands.

     Is there any way to fuse what is best in both MM and Babyl?  I
wish there was a command or switch in Babyl which would swiftly and
cleanly move one into a mode in which one could exercise all of MM's
survey options.

     Babyl and MM are both obsolete programs, written for dead computers
and operating systems.  Let's not forget the equally doomed status of
24x80 fixed-font ASCII terminals and a model of electronic mail where
each user has a byte stream of characters in a "mail file" on his
directory.

     So -- of course something better than MM and Babyl will come along.
I sincerely doubt that it will be especially developed for PDP-10's or
for TOPS-20 (a dead OS) or ITS (an even more moribund OS).  I would also
think that a lot more than MM and Babyl will be looked at in its
development.  While MM is the undoubted #1 TOPS-20 mail system, Hermes,
MAIL/RDMAIL (DEC's bundled TOPS-20 mail software), and DECmail/MS (a DEC
MM clone taken from MM circa 1979) are all in much wider use than Babyl.
While we can ignore the DEC stuff, we can't ignore Hermes.  If MM is the
BMW of mail software then Hermes is the Cadillac (at 4MPG!).  But that
isn't the point -- there is a lot more out there than just the small world
of PDP-10 mail software, much of which has substantially different models
than anything ever done on TOPS-20.

     One of my notions has been a distributed mail database much like
Sweden's COM.  In COM, only one copy of the message exists, in a centralized
mail service base.  The recipients of the message are sent pointers to that
message.  Presumably the message is archived once all the pointers are
deleted.  The next logical step is, of course, access over the network to
the mail database.

     Still another notion has to do with some of the improvements in user
interface possible with more advanced user/machine hardware -- bitmapped
displays, mice, ad nauseum.  The tricky part is to figure out how to get
all the needs integrated together in such a manner that the system as a
whole is usable and does what is needed.  The MIT style of Lisp machines
are a good example of a valiant attempt in that direction; they are also
a good example of what happens to good intentions.  Not that Lisp machines
are bad or anything; rather that the problems they solve and fail to solve
are an excellent learning experience for anybody who feels that human
engineering is trivial.

     Speaking solely as an MM developer, MM was a wonderful program when
it was first written...8 years ago.  The fact that it took over in the
TOPS-20 world is a tribute to how good it was/is.  However, I recognize
the need to move on, and for a while now I have been trying to obtain
funding to develop something now.  Unfortunately, them that funda are more
interested in funding more work on MM (which has been proven to be useful)
than on funding all new R&D.  Needless to say I am still trying (with a
reasonable amount of hope) and so are many others.

     that it will be especially developed for PDP-10's or for

What operating system(s) do you think will dominate the next decade or
so?  Unix, perhaps?  (Even RMS's GNU?)

     I would also think that a lot more than MM and Babyl will be
     looked at in its development.  While MM is the undoubted
     #1 TOPS-20 mail system, Hermes, MAIL/RDMAIL (DEC's bundled

     While we can ignore the DEC stuff, we can't ignore Hermes.  If
     MM is the BMW of mail software then Hermes is the Cadillac
     (at 4MPG!).

I haven't seen Hermes.  What system(s) does it run on?  How does it
differ from MM and Babyl?

     One of my notions has been a distributed mail database
     much like Sweden's COM.  In COM, only one copy of the message
     exists, in a centralized mail service base.  The recipients

     message is archived once all the pointers are deleted.  The
     next logical step is, of course, access over the network to
     the mail database.

Who controls the central mail archive--the Swedish government?  Are
there any concerns expressed in Sweden about the privacy aspects of
COM?  Of course, even if one receives an individual copy of each
message, it is still a trivial matter for government agencies to
maintain surreptitiously a central archive.  Still, the COM system
sounds somewhat controversial.

     (I seem to have deviated slightly from bug-mm's track....)

Does any mechanism exist for translating BABYL

Subject: PDL overflow problem caused by using space bar too often

I often run into a problem when I use Babyl under emacs:
every once-in-a-while I get a
   PDL   Pushdown stack full?
error, from simply hitting the space bar to see the next page of a
message.  I've managed to duplicate this by starting up emacs and
babyl as usual, so I see the most recent message on my screen (it
happens to be shorter than a page.)  Now, hitting the space bar will
beep, as it should (because there isn't a 'next page' to advance to).
But if I do this (hit the space bar) about 20 times, I get the above error.
I can recover; I just type ^R and then restart babyl, but this really
gets annoying -- if I have a lot of messages this error happens at
least once per session.

Should this be happening?  Do I have to manually allocate more
PDL space?  I would think, though, that it's not a good feature if
every press of the space bar takes up PDL space somewhere...

     There's a difference between what operating systems will
dominate and what operating systems are alive.  There are far
more CP/M, MS-DOS, and VM/370 (and successor) systems in the
world than Unix systems.  My personal belief is that all of these
unit-record TTY 33 oriented operating systems (which include
Unix) are dinosaurs.

     Unix's sole redeeming feature is that it is portable.  In
this day and age of throw-away hardware portable software is
crucial.  However, Unix remains a minicomputer operating system
with a toy filesystem and an arcane user interface.

     Hermes runs on Tenex and TOPS-20, and was developed by BBN.
It is closer to MM in interface than Babyl, and is more powerful.
It is also larger and *much* slower than MM.  However, it's
really big with the military folks.  They'd probably use Hermes
exclusively if it weren't for the fact that it is so slow on many
systems you have to use MM just to get work done.  Because of
that, about 2/3 of that world has moved to MM.  A number of
devout Hermes users still exist, mostly because there are things
that Hermes can do that no other mail software can do.

     Privacy in electronic mail is a complete and total joke.
The privacy of electronic mail is only as much as the computer
facility it runs on chooses to grant.  Anybody who believes that
any electronic mail is private is engaging in dangerous self-
delusion.  Anybody who believes that ARPA mail -- and especially
MIT mail -- is private is totally off the wall.

     COM is set up by the universities in Sweden and, I think,
some other European countries.

ZBabyl is basically just Babyl with a couple of add-on libraries to bring 
it up to speed with Zmail (the Lisp Machine's mail reader). If Babyl 
runs for you, so will ZBabyl.

Currently, it's only available on MIT-MC and MIT-OZ because:

 * It expects (at various points in the code) to live on a directory
   with the name "KMP" ... it has to autoload various helper libraries
   which it thinks live on that directory, for example.

 * It has to duplicate some of Babyl's functionality and wastes a couple
   K of space that could be better spent on mail reading. The thought was
   that it should eventually be merged into Babyl (rather than being a
   separate program) and should just make its hairy parts autoload so
   simple uses didn't require extra space.

 * I never got around to it. I probably will eventually.

Sigh.

No.  "& Append..." is, as its name suggests, a subroutine, and not
intended to be accessible as an extended command.  The appropriate
extended command would be 

			M-X # Babyl ^O

This will take a string argument, in the form

		   M-X # Babyl ^OFOO.BAR

As will just plain ^O.

If you do not give a string-arg, both ^O and the extended command 
default to the string defined in the variable Babyl ^O Filename.  
Absent a definition, it comes up FOO.TXT in Babyl 772.

it is missing the valuable Apropos command.  As far as I know no help

be especially useful for both programs, since they are rather large

     Zbabyl's survey functionality, as compared to Babyl's, is
impressive.

     What would also be nice now would be to be able to ask not only
to survey, but to /read/, in forward or reverse order, all messages
with a given sender, recipient, subject, or text string.  Each "n"
command in this mode would bring one to the next message of the
specified type, rather than to the next message in the Babyl file.
The status line might also inform one that the present message in this
mode was message number n of m messages of the specified type.

     It would also be nice to be able to delete a numeric range of
messages with one command, or a set of messages of a particular type.

Have you tried the two-window survey mode?  That's what I use.

In-Reply-To: Message from "David Vinayak Wallace <GUMBY@MIT-MC>" of Mon 22 Apr 85 02:46:13-EST

How would using the two-window survey mode relate precisely to "n"'ing
or "p"'ing through a collection of messages of a given type?

(One problem I've got with two-window modes is that I am using a Model
100 with a 40 x 8 (!) display.  I hope soon to upgrade my micro.)

    or "p"'ing through a collection of messages of a given type?

You can put your self into the survey buffer with '.  Then n,d,p, etc your
way around; t will type the message you're next to.  If you have two-window
survey mode set, or do c-X 2 after ' (maybe this only works in zbabyl?).
Anyway, then T will type the message in the other window.

This is all documented

    (One problem I've got with two-window modes is that I am using a Model
    100 with a 40 x 8 (!) display.  I hope soon to upgrade my micro.)

You're scrod.  Probably the best thing is not to use the two-window mode
but just to "T" the messages that interest you.

You might look into the "|" command. ZBabyl modifies its meaning (to take
advantage of filters) and it does something which isn't exactly what 
you're asking for but which might be good enough...

I suppose "#" might want to be extended to allow "T" as an option to call.
It's not at all useful on a display terminal since it wouldn't wait for 
you to read things as it iterated, but on a paper terminal it might be 
handy.

None of the filter commands understand "reverse order". Sorry about that.

    It would also be nice to be able to delete a numeric range of
    messages with one command, or a set of messages of a particular type.

You can delete messages by filter using the "#" command. I think you'll
find it's quite fun.

    --Frank

It's very complicated to do that for now. There are a lot of efficiency 
issues and a few interface issues to be worked out. It's been discussed and
even thought through fairly carefully but can't easily be done.

Recent changes to ZBabyl make it possible to export and use transparently
as if it were merged with Babyl. If you pick up the following files you
should be able to run it by just setting mail reader library to ZMAIL:

 [XX]PS:<EMACS>TPARSE.EMACS.137
 [XX]PS:<EMACS>TPARSE.^V:EJ.137
 [XX]PS:<EMACS>ZBABYL.LISP.1
 [XX]PS:<EMACS>ZBABYL.EMACS.42
 [XX]PS:<EMACS>ZBABYL.^V:EJ.42
 [XX]PS:<EMACS>ZMENU.EMACS.20
 [XX]PS:<EMACS>ZMENU.^V:EJ.20
 [XX]PS:<INFO>ZBABYL.INFO.4

The root INFO node doesn't point to the ZBabyl documentation. You have to
edit in a ZBabyl node that points to the <INFO> node mentioned here if you
think that's appropriate for your site.

If you have Lisp Machines at your site, you will probably want 
the following additional files which allow you to use the Lisp Machine
mouse with ZBabyl (or vanilla Emacs, for that matter) when netting
into your Tops-20 over Supdup or Telnet.

 [XX]PS:<EMACS>EMOUSE.EMACS.3
 [XX]PS:<EMACS>EMOUSE.^V:EJ.3
 [XX]PS:<EMACS>EMOUSE.LISP.1
 [XX]PS:<EMACS>EMOUSE.SOURCE.18		;Source to the following 5 files
 [XX]PS:<EMACS>EMOUSE.REL4-BIN.4	;Symbolics LM-2 Rel4 binary
 [XX]PS:<EMACS>EMOUSE.REL4-QBIN.4	;Symbolics 3600 Rel4 binary
 [XX]PS:<EMACS>EMOUSE.REL5-BIN.4	;Symbolics 3600 Rel5 binary
 [XX]PS:<EMACS>EMOUSE.REL6-BIN.1	;Symbolics 3600 Rel6 binary
 [XX]PS:<EMACS>EMOUSE.SYS98-QFASL.2	;MIT CADR System 98 binary
 [XX]PS:<EMACS>ZMOUSE.EMACS.2
 [XX]PS:<EMACS>ZMOUSE.^V:EJ.2

If you have another system than the LispM systems I've provided bin files
for, just compile <EMACS>EMOUSE.SOURCE to the appropriate file name (see
<EMACS>EMOUSE.LISP to see what's going on).

Note: The ^V in all of the above names wants to be a real Control-V, of course.

I believe there is a known bug that makes *FILE-FILTER-DAEMONS* not work quite
right on Twenex, but other than that I think everything should mostly work.
Please report any ZBabyl problems to BUG-ZBABYL@MIT-MC so that BUG-BABYL doesn't
get cluttered with irrelevant stuff.

I was replying to some mail and did a lot of switching around between

Does anyone know what is going on?  This is Babyl 770, using MWind, if

	Is this where I should send you mail?  There is nothing for
you to do for keypad, it's a procedure. Do text_line, command, and
key_input.  Each abstraction has a section in implement.doc.  The
rationale for each should go there, followed by rep. inv. and 
abstraction function. I've taken care of text_buffer.

	I'm going to be making changes to specs for text_line
and key_input. They have to do with issues Jim and I resolved,
future stuff, and things we forgot.

Subject: file protection of output messages.

When I output a message to a file using the Babyl O command, it writes
the file with the protection bits 770200 instead of the default
protection of the directory.  I often output to files in a
subdirectory according to subject.  Because in TOPS-20 I don't have
owner access to a subdirectory unless I'm connected to that directory,
I am continually writing a message to a subdirectory, exiting to
EMACS, trying to read the file into EMACS, getting a "read access
required?" error, exiting to exec, connecting to the subdirectory, and
reentering emacs again.  This is a pain.  How can I control what
protection gets used when I output messages to files?  Why doesn't
Babyl use the directory default file protection anyway?

Thanks,
Laura

Try it now.  I edited the babyl file to change its owner to tom.marcia.

Are you quitting with "Q"?  when you list your directory from the exec
(i.e. with DIR at the "@"), the ^V won't print out -- it's just the quoting
character (like calling a lisp symbol "foo/ bar" -- the slash isn't part of
the name).  If you use EMACS DIRED you'll see ^V's.

    P.S. When Edit Babyl Options asks for the owner of the babyl file,
    should it be her uname (marcia) or her dir (tom.marcia)?  It

Owner should be tom.marcia (without the <>'s).  Owner is a hack so that I
can, say, read your babyl file (or a babyl file that belongs to you)
without accidentally munging it.

the error carefully.  You sent the message to two recipients, one
of which was totally bogus.

    The two messages below seem to comprise a bug-babyl report more than
    anything else:

You don't include the original message you were replying to. My guess is that
it had the header:

#1: From: William Daul - Augmentation Systems - McDnD at OFFICE-2
    Sender: <WBD.TYM@OFFICE-2.ARPA>

or

#2: From: William Daul - Augmentation Systems - McDnD at OFFICE-2, <WBD.TYM@OFFICE-2.ARPA>

I don't have a copy of the rfc that relates to this, but my guess is that #1 is
invalid because the From field is probably supposed to be in parsable format and
#2 is invalid because commas cannot appear in a From field (without being supposed
to separate recipients). Perhaps someone who has the relevant RFC can confirm these
guesses.

In any case, I doubt that it's a Babyl bug. More likely this guy at OFFICE-2 sent
you a malformed header. To prove them innocent, you'd have to send us a copy of 
their original header.

Message-ID: <[MIT-MC].512576.850521.BEN>

(I'm sure you're tired of suggested features, but this is a good one.)

I find myself keeping a number of messages in my babyl file, not because
I am interested in the contents anymore, but because it is the easiest way
to retrieve complex return addresses for people.  I use the B listing to
list all my saved messages, Jump to the right one, and Reply (for the
n-th time) just to get the To: field set correctly.  Clearly sub-optimal.

Given the problem, the design of the solution is clear; perhaps even
more so to you than me.  I want the facility for a small,
neatly-organized database, preferably with both human-name and
net-address, that I can scan, point to an address, and say, "Mail to
that person".  Sequential visual search of an alphabetically organized
file is fine, say driven by incremental string-search.  If someone has
a larger set of friends than that, they need a different program.

Unfortunately, this simple idea immediately expands into zillions of other
closely-related features that doubtless complexify the design:  adding people
to cc: fields, defining mailing lists, insertion of addresses, etc.

Nonetheless, this is clearly a real problem that will only get worse as the
network world gets more complex.  Also clearly, babyl is the right tool to
solve it with.

Thanks for listening.

Look into Word Abbrev Mode. It would probably handle most of your problem.
eg, maybe you could make human names or initials word abbrevs for network addresses.

    BABYL people:  Why do so many people send mail to BABYL instead

I think it's a combination of the fact that the sample
message that says

 From: Babyl
 Re: hi

 Welcome to babyl, etc.

is easy to reply to accidentally. Also, I have the intuition that
there is someone who really thought that his mailing address is
Babyl ... or perhaps someone is getting wires crossed by someone
who said
 You can send me mail using Babyl at OZ [as a program].
getting a listener-parse of
 You can send me mail using Babyl@OZ [as an address].

C'est la vie. It's clearly for occassions like this that God gave
us the letter 'D'.

The Undigestify command in Zmail is very nice.  A small problem with it is that
it tends to leave a leading blank line in the undigestified messages.  Although
this is not a problem for ZMail, subsequent attempts to read the mail file

Seems like there must be another name you could call the file so it would only
work as an init for you and not bother others in that directory. In any case,
as an interim measure, I edited GUEST2;BABYL VARS so that it doesn't set
Babyl CC To to be LIN unless it's being used by LIN. I also changed it to not
flush a couple of header fields that some people might find important since LIN
is not the only one being affected by that init...

Why don't you just conditionalise it to CC only mail from LIN automatically

I modified BABYLM to look for (ITS only) HSNAME;XUNAME BABINI and XNUAME
BVARS instead of the current situation.

I didn't install it because I 1> Don't know how, and 2> Don't know how to

Subject: more on babyl multi-window buffer mixup

Ok, this time I have a really simple sequence which generates a SFL
error: R (goes into two-window reply mode), ^X1, ^Z^Z to send message.

I use the MWIND library, if that matters.  The error is occurring at the
-s^_^Q^L^M^J  in & Label Babyl Message, called by my Babyl R Done Hook:
	1,-1m(m.m& Label Babyl Message$)to answer$
At that point the selected buffer seems to be *Mail* rather than *Babyl*,
and if I ignore the message or Q out of TDEBUG I am still in *Mail*.

I have looked at the source a few times and not seen any obvious blunders.
Anyone else have any clues?

If I label something "t=to do<lf>", the label gets put in the label list
at the start of the Babyl file correctly but the "t=" part is not
flushed from the label added to the message.  And then I can't remove
it because the label completer won't let me type an equal sign, and if
I just type a T it tells me it wasn't labeled "to do" (it was labeled
"t=to do").

The "Owner" field in the Babyl Options section must contain your user
name literally. Babyl compares the user's name against that field and
will not modify the Babyl file or mail file if the name does not match.
Only
	Owner: SJG
will work. Things like 
	Owner: Steven J. Gordon <SJG at OZ>
will not work unless you can figure out how to log in with the user
name "Steven J. Gordon <SJG at OZ>".

In ZBabyl, you can use the @ command on all of the messages you mean to 
reply to. Then use m-X Yank References while composing the reply. It's not
quite what you want (since it makes a References field and not an In-Reply-To
field; the final message will appear to be In-Reply-To one message and refer 
to a bunch of messages), but it's fairly close.

You've probably received this suggestion already, but I'll
give it a try anyway. You know of course about the generic
problem with the R command - people regularly CC entire lists
by accident. Everyone knows what a pain in the neck this has
become.

I suggest that you switch the R and 1R commands. Make the default
be to NOT write a CC in the header. Smart people who understand
about parameters should be the only ones trusted with the CC option.

If I remail a message, it gets the From: field copied into a Sender: field.
I realize this is done to prevent automatic creation of a Sender: field with
contents being the remailing user (which would be wrong) but I think it is
equally wrong to fill out Sender: with From:.  Perhaps a better way would
be to make remailing come in after the part that inserts the sender, or to not
do any sender insertion if there is a ReSent-x: header in the buffer.

This is to clarify last night's message to both BUG-EMACS and
BUG-BABYL, specifically that & BABYL Append$ is broken.  Do a G
command to read in new mail, which claims it is appending the new mail
to your BABYL file.  Then go look at that BABYL file with EMACS and
find the new mail was NOT appended, even though the write date/time
was changed.  If you do not do an explicit S and the system crashes,
your new mail will be lost - which is how I discovered this problem...

It would be nice if the "More" in, for instance,

Babyl (Message 101/102,--MORE--

were replaced (as in EMACS) by information about what percentage of a
message had been read so far.  (c-w, I know, will tell one how many
lines/screens of a message remain to be read, but I find the
percentage figure to be more informative.)

I also wish one could jump around in a Babyl message (by number of
lines, percentage of text, strings, etc.) in the manner of the VIEW
program which is available from OZ's exec.

The explicit Reply-To should lock out the CC.  RFC-822 only defines the

to me that if someone put in a REPLY-TO field, then that should be the
sole list of receipients.

My mode line now reads:

What this means is that I typed E^H at DDT and ^XR at EMACS,
immediately did a m-X Output Labeled Messages and answered "no" and "yes"
and then did E (to expunge the messages I had output)
all this before any redisplay had a chance to happen.

Then I got anomalous results:  The message on my screen was the last message
previously read rather than the first new unseen message it should have been.
So then I did N to see the first new message, deleted the first two, saw that
the third message had an impossible message number, and sent this bug report.

There should be a bug command that inserts the lossage into the mail buffer.

[My apologies to anyone who gets this twice.  I think COMSAT is
supposed to be smart enough to avoid this.  We'll see.  I wanted to
get a large cross section of people quickly, since ECC, the most
likely one to answer this question, hasn't logged in since April.]

I'd be interested to know if Babyl has some way of implementing two
more hooks.  I want a hook to run a particular function just after
Babyl reads in a file (either on startup or after an I command), and a
hook to run a particular function just before Babyl files out (either
because of a Q or another I...  etc.).  In the former case, I want to
automatically snarf in the "most recent" set of labels from one of two
files, and in the latter case, to sort the labels list before it's
written out.  (I have both of these macros already written, but no
automatic way to call them.)

Can I do this in any convenient way in Babyl without generating a new
release that has these hooks in it explicitly?  If necessary, of
course, I can write my own slightly altered versions of the
appropriate functions, but I'd rather not if there's a more elegant
way...

Thanx for any help you can provide.

It would be nice if Babyl, on Twenex, warned you if the "to"
or "cc" field of a message under preparation contained an
address that the mailer was bound to reject.  (MM does this
fairly well).  Recovering from the partial transmission of a
message with several recipients, only some of whom are
rejected, is awkward; there is no way I know to send the
repaired message, with it's original "to" and "cc," lists
but only to those who did not get the message the first time
it was sent.  Perhaps we could have PTO and PCC fields,
standing for Phoney-to and Phoney-cc!  But it would be
better to check all the addresses before sending to any;
sending out messages with bad addresses also frustrates
those who wish to reply.

INFO-BABYL exists as a one-way communication channel from the Babyl implementors
to the Babyl users for the announcement of important new Babyl features. (With a
few exceptions, most INFO-xxx lists are of this kind; the lists INFO-MICRO,
INFO-APPLE, etc are mis-named.) If you have queries about a program, please 
address them to a BUG-xxx list rather than an INFO-xxx list. eg, BUG-BABYL
might have been an appropriate target for your recent message about Babyl on
IBM PC's. (Don't bother resending your message to BUG-BABYL now, since BUG-BABYL
is probably a subset of INFO-BABYL, and everyone probably saw it by now.)

Subject: Overquoting MMAILR-queued messages

Given a From: line of the form:

"Webb Mike"@LLL-MFE

BABYL does not remove the double quotes when building the envelope for
the queue file in a reply.  This causes MMAILR to add additional
backslash quoting which is dutifully stripped at LLL-MFE and results
in an unrecognized address there.

According to Mark:

     MMailr requires that SMTP quotes NOT be in the envelope; it
applies SMTP quoting itself.  If a quote appears in the envelope,
MMailr assumes that the quote is a significant character in the
address and will backslash-quote the quote!

     This is NOT, repeat, NOT an MMailr bug.  This is the way the
queued mail file functionality is designed, and implemented, and used
by MM with quoted addresses.

Hi,

  We have several problems with BABYL.  First of all, I don't think we have 
the most up-to-date sources here (Stanford).  Second, we have moved to a 
new login system on our cluster of DEC-20's, for which 3 computers access the 
same disks (technically, it's called the Common File System).  One of the 
consequences of this situation is that users have their account on a different
structure than the one used for mailq: and so cannot rename files from one
to the other.  I fixed this problem, by changing the file writing part of 
"& MMAILR babyl queueing function" (in BABYLM.EMACS) to

:ew mailq:[--queued.......]    $
 and then: HP :EF

This seems to work fine except that MMAILR does nasty things to the file when 
it tries to send it...  I'll ask the maintainer of MMAILR to fix it (or tell me
what he changed so I can fix it).

The other problem is that I am not absolutely sure of what files are supposed
to go into the babyl library.  As far as I could guess, one must use 
IVORY, and generate the library from BABYL.EMACS and BABYLM.EMACS.  Is this 
correct, and if not what is the correct procedure?

Thanks,

Bruno Chanal

If I lean on my space bar on my Ann Arbor by mistake, and type a lot of
spaces (repeat and no key-click) while I'm reading a message, eventually
Babyl beeps at me and tells me that there aren't any more pages to the
message, but then it craps out completely with a PDL-overflow while entering
the error handler.  Emacs is fukt at that point, and behaving like teco
(commands echo in the echo area, stuff like that).  I didn't think to try
^R$$ to see if it recovered.  In any case, wouldn't it be nice if Babyl
didn't generate recursive errors when you leaned on your space bar?  Seems
like not quite the best of user interfaces.  If one isn't debugging it or
something, it should blow off that error handler invocation before entering
another.

    I am having trouble with large files. Buffer exhausted blather. 
    Whats the fix for this? Thanxs

Babyl's address space is non-extensible, so when your Babyl file gets
big, the only thing you can do is delete messages. You can, however,
move them to other files (using the "O" command) before deleting them.
There are commands for moving back and forth between files (eg, see
the "I" command) which involve writing out the whole file you're viewing,
then recycling the space it was using to read in the new file.

You might look into ZBabyl. It takes advantage of some ideas from the
Lisp Machine Zmail program to make some of these things easier. It has
the disadvantage that it takes more space than regular Babyl, and so 
the Babyl files you can fit are even smaller, but its advantage is that 
it makes mail reading more efficient, which may be worth the price.
ZBabyl is just a Babyl extension and uses the same file format as Babyl,
so you can go back and forth between them. ZBabyl is documented in Info
(from Emacs, type c-X I); report problems to Bug-ZBabyl@MC. Good luck.

If you are logged out before writing your Babyl file then you lose all
your recent mail.  This is because your recent mail is in a deleted
file ([BABYL.<username>) and your directory is expunged on logout.
The same thing could happen if you expunged and reset your Babyl fork.

I propose that the [BABYL.<username> file is not deleted until a write
is done (w/ either Q or S commands).  This way no matter what happens,
if you lose your Babyl fork without writing the file, Babyl will
notice that their was a crash and read in the lost messages.

Doug,

The ONLY things you should ever loose after BABYL has read your new
mail is any changes you made to the new mail.  With the implicit G on
BABYL startup or the explicit G while running BABYL, you ALWAYS get
the new mail appended to your .BABYL file (or prepended if you chose
that option), BEFORE BABYL deletes the [BABYL.name file.

The exception to all of the above is ZBABYL, which does behave as you
describe and has been reported as a bug (by me) several months ago.

    ZBabyl doesn't handle crashes very well.  It seems mail is not
    actually appended to one's Babyl file until one explicitly saves
    (either w/ S or Q).  This has caused me (and others) to lose mail,
    something mail readers should strive to prevent.  Any chance of a fix?
    ZBabyl adds much needed features to Babyl, but I'm not sure they're
    worth it with this non-feature.

This fairly long-standing bug in ZBabyl (originally reported by FJW) 
has finally been fixed.

For those interested, the bug was due to the fact that Babyl had a
macro (& Babyl Append) whose name was a proper substring of a ZBabyl 
macro name (& Babyl Append Refs). Because of the way the named-macro
finder works in Teco, doing m(m.m& Babyl Append) was finding the 
wrong macro.

This bug only struck if you appended mail to your babyl file (most of 
us at MIT prepend). That, combined with the fact that if you just read
the code, it looked fine, was what took so long to track it down.

Apologies for the delay in this fix.

Subject:  O with file version=-1 doesn't write whole file


The relevant part of my EMACS.VARS file is:
Babyl O Filename:OZ:<PARKER.MAIL>FOO.XMAIL
Babyl File Version:-1				

When I hit 'O' I get the prompt for the file to output to.
I type a unique specifier and hit ESC for completion.  It
completes it properly to, say, BAR.XMAIL.1 (and that file
exists!).  I hit return and it writes a new
file (BAR.XMAIL.2) with ONLY that message in it.

I want file version at -1 so that my main babyl file increments.
I don't particularly care whether the others inc (seems like they
should for consistency), but I think the O command only makes
sense if the whole file gets written out.  (At the very least,
it should claim to be writing out to FOO.XMAIL.0 and not .1)

Does anyone have a workaround or explanation for this?

Bob,

How large your *Mail* buffer can be is a function of how much space
remains leftover in your environment, with your *Babyl* buffer taking
up the largest portion.  In other words, read in another small or
empty Babyl file with the I command, and you should be able to send a
fairly large mail file, limited by whatever your MMAILR permits.

Give the EMACS command to BABYL: X What Available Space$ will tell you
just how much space you do have available for a *Mail* buffer.

What's the best way to get more buffer allocation ? Does this

Everything in your emacs has to fit in a pdp-10 address space.  Either
your babyl file or the bboard file is too big.  Fix this by deleting
(if ity's your babyl file) or moving (in either case) some messages
from the file in question.

Twenex being twenex you may not be able to to the latter operation to
the bboard file in which case grouch in the direction of bug-oz

This is just a request.  It sure would be nice if BABYL did a tiny bit
of host name validation before sending off a message.  Just a little
warning message "Warning: FOO.BAR.EDU is an unknown host," or something
like that, before giving the message over to COMSAT.  I know this would
be hard to do, but I think the need is increasing, what with domain
naming, mail coming from some very random places with invalid From:
fields, long COMSAT turnaround times, etc.

Subject: Routing of Replies to Electronic Mail

I would like some advice on the right way
to handle the From field (using Babyl) on outgoing mail from OZ.
Given that RICH@MIT-OZ is not a valid Arpanet address, I have set my
Babyl User Name to RICH@MIT-AI, which is now back on the Arpanet.
However, this has the bad effect of routing replies to all local MIT
mail (e.g.  from other people on OZ) through AI (where my inquir file
redirects it to OZ).  With all the new network technology, is there
now a better way to handle this?
		Thanks, Chuck.

No. There's not much of a good solution once you get to this point other
than extreme actions such as using MM, Zmail, or whatever -- even using
bare Emacs -- to edit your mail file down to something manageable. The
pdp10 address space is only 256K 36-bit words and when it's used up, many
programs can't do better -- Teco/Emacs/Babyl, for example. MM plays special
games that let it handle larger mail files, but eventually you will find
that it loses, too.

Preventative measures work better. That is, don't let your mail pile up.
If you find you're holding onto a lot of back mail, use the O command to
move the mail to move the mail to auxiliary files.

If you really just can't keep up no matter what you try, you should probably
find a Lisp Machine somewhere and start using Zmail on a regular basis.

PROBLEM:

In BABYL and ZBABYL on a VT100 or similar terminal, a "Q" or ^X^Z
leaves the cursor at the top of an uncleared screen instead of the
bottom, as intended.


DIAGNOSIS:

In some versions of TECTRM.MID, somebody got over zealous and "fixed"
VT1INI ("FORCE ANSII [sic] MODE") to include an ORIGIN reset sequence,
"$[?6l".  This has the side effect of overriding any previous curpos
sequence and put the cursor at the top of the screen.

CURE:

A "quick fix" is to remove the ORIGIN reset sequence, which is
patchable in TECPUR.EXE.  The "correct" (untested) fix would be to
envelope the ORIGIN mode reset with a Save Cursor and Restore Cursor
sequence, resulting in: $<$7$[?6l$8 .

It's not clear to me it should.  JTW and I thrashed this out for a

figure this out for itself and that RFC 822 doesn't say a word about
it.

Take this alternative case:
I'm at stanford, mailing to you from some friend's account.  I mail to
dms%oz@mc.lcs.mit.edu.  But I want you to reply to me at OZ, since
I'll be home to rad it.  Why should I type gumby%oz@mc.lcs.mit.edu,
when GUMBY@OZ would work as well for your mail reader?  Should
stanford refuse to send the mail because it can't grok the Reply-to:

Message-ID: <860514132533.2.PSZ@HARVEY.LCS.MIT.EDU>

I don't know if this should be a bug report to Babyl or to Zmail, but
here goes.  When Babyl creates a new babyl file with an incoming mail
file associated with it, it chooses the ITS stylistic form:
	DIR; DEV: FOO MAIL
Unfortunately, if I then move this Babyl file to LMFS and then operate
on it, the filename parser appears to be trying to interpret this as
the "DIR; DEV" device, which of course it won't find.  I.e., it seems
that if the Babyl file is not coming off an ITS machine, Zmail doesn't
realize that it should apply ITS file naming conventions to the mail
file name.  Simply choosing the alternative stylistic format:
	DEV: DIR; FOO MAIL
works fine, because then MC: is recognized as the machine, and from
there on the appropriate conventions are applied.

This problem could be fixed either by changing the Babyl preferred way
of listing ITS mail file names or by fixing Zmail so it permits DIR;DEV:
form of file spec as well.

Subject: Status bits

Like others, I've been using MM to preprocess my mail, mainly to move
certain large messages elsewhere before BABYL gets them and runs out
of memory.  What I find annoying is that BABYL ignores the message
status bits in the process of converting the TOPS-20 mail file.

So, the question for today is: does anyone have a private hack that
preserves the meanings of those bits and translates them into the
corresponding BABYL labels or whatever?  If not, is anyone willing to
create one?

Hi.  You and I seem to be the only ones touching Babyl recently.  So
before (or instead of) asking the Bug-Babyl list, let me ask you this.
It seems that the Babyl sources themselves think that the canonical
source location for Babyl is MC.  This no longer works for a whole
bunch of reasons (no such directories, etc).  MX is also a poor
choice.  The BABYL-INSTALLERS list on MC seems to imply that non-XX
people should get notified when a new Babyl is installed there.  On
the other hand, the only version currently on XX is one with "local
changes" by you, hence probably not good for distribution.  You're
also not on *any* of the Babyl-whatever lists (dunno if this is an
oversight or deliberate), so I don't know if whomever makes changes to
Babyl on XX (only you?) announces them.

In view of all this (and because I've been doing a little hacking of
late), I am tempted to make OZ the canonical location for Babyl
sources.  It's time to decide this for real, because the most recent
changes that have been made are on Twenex, not ITS, and they have
started to diverge (you've made local changes to XX, and I do not know
if they can be transported).

Now, no matter which way this goes (wherever the latest sources are
supposed to live), I'd like to bring OZ's and XX's Babyl back into
correspondence.  At this particular instant, by removing your changes
on XX, they would be correspondent---but I'm about to release a
slightly changed version on OZ.  Is it a good idea for me to simply
merge in your XX changes to the version I'll release on OZ?  Will they
work on ITS and hence all the sources everywhere can agree?

Thanx much.

Lenny,

Don't jump to conclusions.  Lots of people scattered all over the
Internet hack on BABYL.  Just because I'm the only one you know face
to face doesn't mean I'm the only one.

XX's sources have changes that should -not- be blindly distributed.
They do the right thing on Twenex (^? quoting on hostnames for MMAILR)
but in the wrong way (not opsys specific, not MMAILR specific, kludgey
code in # Babyl R: to boot).  At some point if I find the time I will
merge this into the common sources (which live on MC or AI, I
believe).  I don't think the XX changes will break anybody out in net
land (running Twenex and MMAILR), but they -will- break ITS.

OZ is a bad place for the master sources because OZ isn't on the
Internet.

My not being on any of the Babyl lists is an oversight.  I just
corrected it.

Okay, I stand corrected.  I was looking at who has made recent changes
to the copies I saw at MIT.  For the moment (until someone says
otherwise), I shall assume that the canonical source location is on
AI.  MC is clearly wrong, since it has no sources on it right now (not
even an EMACS1; directory); MX is unwise.  The current sources cannot
be compiled on AI using their built-in local option Compile Command,
since they assume ECC's directory exists, so I won't feel bad about
changing just that line in the comments at the back to do the right
thing on OZ at least (clearly that command must be either changed or
done manually on all systems but one anyway; no reason to have it not
work on even one at the moment).

I'll make sure to copy around my changes to keep all the versions
consistent, but will not incorporate any of the XX-specific changes
into them.  You'll have to snarf the changes for XX yourself (once I
release) since a) you've gotta merge 'em with your stuff, and b) I
probably can't write onto XX:<EMACS> (no account there).

Ciao.

If a vote were to be taken, I would prefer XX over OZ for the same
reason that Rob gave, accessibility from the net.  Also, note that
Rob's changes, were, in part, a reconstruction due to a disk crash,
and the base version he used was one behind the then current version.

    I've got s few bugs with my babyl.  

    1) If I pick up my babyl fork from top level by using continue, then
    if I ^L to refresh the screen it converts a region to lower case.

You're probably exiting with ^X^C.  EMACS sees the ^X, but never sees
the ^C (the EXEC gets it first and halts the fork).  Then, when you
continue and type ^L, EMACS sees ^X^L which is ^R Lowercase Region...

Cure:  exit with ^X^Z.  This is a much more graceful exit, in that it
lets EMACS do whatever autosaving etc it wants to do first.

    2) When I delete a portion of a message before ^o outputting to a file
    I often get an URK Q-register or PDL underfill or overflow.  I don't know
    what my kill ring has to do with this loop, but I often get that
    message.  I'll try to keep track of other incidents.

This is almost certainly due to the fact that your Babyl file is 142
pages long.  EMACS, with all its various libraries, including Babyl
(which is quite large), plus a large Babyl file, is dangerously close
to simply running out of address space---you only get 2^18 words,
period.  When you kill a portion of a message using ^W or whatever, it
gets added to your kill ring, further increasing your total required
space...  etc.

Usually, you get an URK.  I've noticed instances, usually with very
big Babyl files and/or lots of loaded libraries, where EMACS will get
illegal memory writes and/or reads, as if there's something broken
with its memory allocation strategy.  Various PDL problems may be
related to this.

Cure:  halve the size of your Babyl file.

    If you can do anything I'll be delighted.

That's a Twenex I/O error, not a BABYL error.  Twenex wouldn't let
BABYL write out some file (like maybe the composed message it was
trying to hand to MMAILR), because either some directory (yours,
MAILQ:, dunno) or the whole OZ: structure had run out of space.

When I try to start up babyl, I get an emacs error saying something about 
File Not Found and then immediately pops into a babyl buffer with this message:

QNS Q-Register not string or buffer

The result is that I'm in a buffer with no access to my mail.  Any help would
be appreciated.

The emacs that <emacs>babyl.exe.774 was dumped out was lost when
the emacs directory was trashed.

I don't know how to dump a babyl.exe, and I don't see any files
for doing it either.  Could someone tell me how?  It would be nice
to have a batch job to dump it, like INFO and TEACH-EMACS.

To redump a Babyl:

Connect to <EMACS>.  Read BABYL-DUMP.TXT (or somesuch) which also
refers you to DUMP-BABYL.TXT.  Still connected to <EMACS>, and making
damned sure your SYS: logical is set up right and that no inits are
visible, start up TECO and type @er dump-babyl.init$ @y m(hfx*)$$ at
it.  Assuming you haven't redefined EMACS: to point somewhere random,
it should dump out a new Babyl to <EMACS>BABYL.EXE.

Have fun.

Subject: @ vs " at "

I asked about this a while ago, and it sounded like there is no option
for babyl not to convert @'s in addresses to " at ".  This is very
inconvenient for these reasons:

1)  I normally log in to oz from athena, where I use a window system
(X) with cut and paste facilities.  When I edit the info-nets mailing
list, I like to cut and paste addresses from messages to the list.
This forces me to type 1h to get the original header back, and h again
to restore the original form.

2)  When I reply to mail, I often get broken bitnet addresses of the
form user@host rather than user%host.bitnet@wiscvm.wisc.edu.  This
forces me to edit the address, and converting "user at host" to
"user%host.bitnet@wiscvm.wisc.edu" is unnecessarily painful (I assume
"user at host.bitnet@wiscvm.wisc.edu" would not be converted into the
right thing).

3)  user@host is a lot cleaner (for me, at least) to look at because
it is the format I see everywhere else (this means rmail, but any
other mail reader would do the same thing).  Also, the @ symbols are
set off from text much better than " at ".

I remember looking thru the code once, and I think I found the spot
(this was O(one year ago)), but I have no idea how to fix it, since I
don't know teco.  I think the right thing to do is to make it a
variable; both behaviors are reasonable.

Actually, I should mention that I intend to fix this on OZ only.
Babyl between XX and OZ has diverged, and SRA promised a while ago to
incorporate the divergent XX code sometime, when he had a chance.
Until that happens, I won't propagate any changes off of OZ.  Once
that happens, there are a couple of small things I intend to propagate
to the MIT Babyl sites (which means XX and the ITSen), and control of
"@" vs " at " will be one of them.

Robert,

You might try setting the variable "Babyl Reformation Control" to 2.
It turns off some of the prettification code, which is probably what
you want.

For the edification of the BABYL maintainers (I don't know who they are
these days):  The kind of addresses JAR is talking about are called
"forward paths" and usually come from mailers which are sending back an
error receipt.  They were constructed by reversing the "Return-path" of
the erring message, and they're definitely legal.

I fail to see the purpose of incoming host name reformation.  First,
you shouldn't see an unofficial name in incoming mail.  Second, if you
do and you can figure out the real name it refers to when you do
header reformation, then the mailer can equally well figure out the
real name to send to when you reply.

Outgoing header reformation can already be a performed; there is a
switch whose name I don't remember but which should be on by default,
which causes Babyl to put DELs around hostnames; when MMAILR sees them
it replaces whatever they delimit by official host names.

So, can you explain why the changes you propose are useful?

David,

I will concede header reformation on incoming mail if you
can guarantee that no one will ever use the ^O command.

The reason for this is that we recently were forced to
drop all aliases from our HOSTS.TXT file so that it would
fit and allow plenty of IP free buffer space on our 5.4
512KW and 768KW 2040's.  Thus, the fixup normally done
by MMAILR is no longer possible.

Yes, there are *many* hosts still not using their Official
Host Names in the mail headers they generate...

Frank,

I'll withhold my opinions on the tastefulness of your idea and just
answer the question.  Of the options available the only one that seems
practical would be to run your KCC program via the FZ commands (q.v.),
using temporary files (or maybe the Stanford pipe device if your
monitor has it) to pass around the data.  You should probably use the
existing code for ^? quoting of hostnames and just process the message
like MMAILR would before handing the message off to MMAILR.

Problem: BABYL ought to be writing (FOO%BAR@BAZ) instead of (FOO%BAR @BAZ)
into COMSAT mail request files.  (See below message from Moon.)

This should be very easy to fix.  From my limited knowledge of TECO it
appears that the right thingwould be to delete the space preceding the
^] in the following line (which occurs two or three times):

	  0l iRCPT: :lr i 1	!* Finish it off.!

However, someone who knows TECO and BABYL better, and knows how to run
IVORY and install a new version of BABYLM, ought to check this out
rather than leave it up to me, who hasn't done this kind of thing
before.  (I'm not even sure I would know how to get a look at the
request file before COMSAT gobbles it up.)

Thanks,

Re:   JAR's problem with % syntax in recipients
Message-ID: <138701.870110.MOON@AI.AI.MIT.EDU>

There were really two problems.  One is that the input format
generated by :MAIL (the old TO: format rather than the new RCPT:
format) wasn't parsed correctly.  I fixed that in the source and
patched it in the Comsat binary on AI only.  I believe I no longer
know how to assemble and install a Comsat (it used to be easy).

The second problem is with the input format generated by Babyl,
which contains a superfluous space before the atsign.  Rmail does
not generate this space and works.  I looked at the relevant parsing
code in Comsat, but it looks infeasible to make it do the right to
left parsing that would have to be done to realize that there is
a host name after the space and therefore the recipient name should
be parsed differently.  Instead, Jonathan is going to look into
getting Babyl fixed to omit the space.

If something else in Comsat on AI breaks, blame me.

I got impatient, so I just went and fixed BABYLM myself, and it appears
to work.
New version is in AI: EMACS1; BABYLM 166 and EMACS; BABYLM :EJ.
Old version is in AI: EMACS1; BABYLM 165 and JAR; BABYLM EJ165.

I didn't distribute to any other machines because I didn't know
what was the procedure for doing so.  Anyhow this only makes a
difference if you're on an ITS and you happen to send to recipients like
FOO%BAR@BAZ where BAR is in the host table AND it would be invalid to
send to FOO@BAR instead.  So propagation is not urgent.

If someone would check my work that would be nice.   - Jonathan

BABYL doesn't know that it needs to coerce relative GMT representation
of the sender's time (i.e., +nnn, -nnn, +nnnn, and -nnnn) into a
format which TOPS-20 can convert.  Time relative to GMT is legal 822
and seems to be more prevalent lately.

Would somebody please look into the problem and, perhaps, publish a
work-around or fix?

I seem to have munged my babyl file in the process of trying
to create anoter one.  Whenever I try to Get new messages (either
upon entry to babyl or manually) I receive the error message
"some mail remains from previous babyl crash" and then "bad 
message file?"  Aack!  can you help un-ravel this?  Messages seem
to go into Mail.txt ok but I still worry about missing important
incomming mail...  

Babyl is my default mail reader in emacs and <jks>JKS.BABYL is my
babyl file.  <jks>mail.txt.1 is my incomming mail file.  I have tried
deleting and expunging them both and creating an new jks.babyl
with no success (i.e. same error messages still appear).  Feel free to
delete either of these if it helps.  (JKS.OLD is my backup file of old
messages so please DON'T delete it!)  

Many thanks for any help you can give, Ken.

That explains why when I looked I could find no reason for your
problem.  Do you know what that file is?  When babyl reads your mail
it renames your MAIL.TXT file to [BABYL.TXT to avoid races with the
mailer and then processes your [BABYL.TXT.  By deleting that file you
deleted your inbox before someone could salvage it for you.

    Back to my original goal: I want to send to a file (babyl or
    otherwise) a copy of messages I send to my groups mailing list

The entry in the mailing-lists.txt file looks fine to me and the
mailer understands it.  What problem do you have with it?  Perhaps
you've protected that file too strongly?

MMAILER may not create a file (OZ's mailer has been mauled by enough
people that I can't say this for sure) so you might want to create
that file making sure it has at least append access for the world.

Has someone fixed BABYL to properly handle the route-address format
in headers?  Route-addresses are legal address forms according to
RFC 822 and look like <@host:user@host> or <@host1,...,@hostn:user@hostn>.
These appear in mail rejection notices sent to the Return-Path:,
where the address in the Return-Path: is that of a mailing list
maintainer.  There may be other conditions where that format appears,
but the one described is the most common one we see.

In-reply-to: Msg of 1 Jun 1987  15:12-EDT from RIG@XX.LCS.MIT.EDU

    Date: Monday, 1 June 1987  15:12-EDT
    From: RIG@XX.LCS.MIT.EDU

    It seems that when you have a lot of messages in your babyl file and
    you start going through them issuing lots of commands, you are prone
    to getting a message which says something like "pushdown stack full".
    Then you seem to be in the painful situation of not even being able to
    issue a q command in order to save the file with all the deletions you
    have made and to start over.  The only quasi-solution people around
    here seem to know of is to issue a ^c and reset the thing, so that you
    lose all the changes you've made while in babyl.  Could someone please
    improve the operation of the program so it will say something before
    reaching this dreadfully wedged state, so that you can save your
    changes.  I'm also surprised that when you do an e and and s command,
    you don't seem to get any resetting of state which would delay the
    occurence of this pushdown stack full business.

Well, if the pushdown stack overflows it's not surprising that you
can't call any more routines (after all, what would they use for a
stack?).  Unless you are doing something like using C-X M inside
itself a lot, this is probably just some routine that forgets to
execute a ^\ after pushing a lot of junk on the stack.

You can get out of this if you're willing to talk to TECO directly.
If you can, get into a minibuffer and execute a ^W to get back to
TECO's main command loop.  If you can't get into a minibuffer
(likely), just start typing lots of harmless characters (like <Space>)
until you overload the error handler and it throws you into TECO.
From TECO you can get back to BABYL by doing
	:M(M.M BABYL$)$$
If that doesn't work, try doing
	M(M.M Select Buffer$)*Babyl*$$
	M(M.M Write File$)BABYL.EXPLODED$$
	^Z
which will at least dump out the current in-memory state of your BABYL
file to a disk file of your choosing (you probably don't want to
overwrite your old BABYL file until you know what state the new one is
in).

A more useful thing to do would be to find out which routine is
neglecting to fix the stack.  I can't give you a script for doing
that, you'd have to know TECO and the EMACS debugger to start with.

Yeah, except that you can't run the error handler or debugger without
stack.  See the description of ..P for more info.  At this point the
easiest way out is causing a ^W by overloading the error handler.

Thanks for your suggestion on what do do when stuck in the offensive
state.  It seems like a pretty painful script, though, certainly one
I'll have trouble remembering.  I don't know if it will help to
determine what part of the program is causing the offense, but I can
tell you more about my pattern of operation.

I believe, but cannot be sure, that I have on ocassion received the
offending message just because I had done a long sequence of commands
from the following set: n, p, d, ^d, e, and s.  I know, however, that
in the latest incident I had also done one or two instances of
recursive editing (^r), killing something, and leaving the recursive
edit (^z ^z).  It is also conceivable that I used the commands o and
(less likely) i.  I also might have replied to a message during the
session, but I don't think so.  In any case, at the time of the
complaint, I am pretty certain that my last command was just n, p, d,
or ^d, and probably one of the first two.

If this helps anyone to be able to figure out a fix to the problem, I'll
be appreciative of whatever they can do.

Thanks again.

Some TECO function isn't cleaning up the stack properly, which doesn't

Subject: BABYL.780 and BABYLM.167 installed on AI:EMACS1;

These are merges of the current XX and OZ BABYL sources, which
diverged some time ago.  I believe this set of sources will do the
right thing on OZ, XX, and ITS.  Currently you have to do a couple of
translations before M-X Compile$ will work on ITS; about the only
thing I can think of to fix that is a VERY long Compile Command
variable that conditionalizes based on FSOSTECO$ (bletch).

This code has been running on XX for several weeks with no reported
problems.  I haven't installed the :EJ files on ITS because I don't
think it matters much and because I don't use BABYL on ITS enough to
test it completely.  I was able to do the basic sorts of things with a
test version on ML.

I have no idea what the state of things is on OZ at the moment.  The
new code should run on OZ just fine if the OZ-specific kludges are put
in the right place (the EMACS:SITE.INIT file, rather than in the BABYL
code itself).

    Hookay.  I've finished synching OZ's Babyl to XX's.  My wart on ECC's
    original kluge has been transformed into something more palatable.

    What isn't done:
    o  The EMACS 165/EMACS 169 issue.

I installed OZ:<EMACS>EMACS.INIT.50 on XX, seems to work.

    o  I haven't even looked at the ITSen to see what their state is.

Should be ok.  You probably want to be very paranoid about installing
new stuff there, but I believe that things are in something
aproximating a consistant state.

    o  JBA, I haven't acted on the hack you mentioned to me.  It won't
       happen today (I'm waiting to see if I blew it somehow), but
       probably later in the week.

    What happened:

    I have installed the most recent versions of BABYL and BABYLM from XX.
    There were some problems, but things appear to be working okay now.

    First, the stuff in XX:PS:<EMACS>BABYL.OZ-INIT-KLUDGE doesn't quite
    work.  I'm reasonably sure it's a quoting issue:  the ^]'s in the
    string cause ?QNS errors (evaluation of q7 is probably happening too
    early) if I try to set the variable that way, and using ^A in place
    doesn't cause errors, but the ^A'd items don't seem to match any
    strings.  I haven't taken the time to figure this out; since the whole
    thing is OZ-specific anyway, I've just substituted MIT-OZ (what would
    have been in q7, the idea of the ^]7's) in place.  That variable is
    now in OZ's SITE.INIT.

Obviously a brain bubble on my part, I just moved the kludge code into
a new file and forgot about it.  Using a literal MIT-OZ instead of ^]7
sounds ok.

    Second, it appears that the process of dumping a Babyl *never* reads
    SITE.INIT, nor does the dumped Babyl read SITE.INIT when it comes up.
    Hence, the variable setting in SITE.INIT will not take effect for
    dumped Babyl's.  (Use @SET TRAP FILE if you don't believe me...  I
    found it rather odd, too, since TECO.INIT *is* read, and it sets
    *Initializations* to have the right pathname for SITE.INIT.
    *Initializations* should get run on entry to ^R mode, and then
    EMACS.INIT reads SITE.INIT, but this isn't happening for the
    dumping-Babyl case because it never reads EMACS.INIT.  I haven't
    pursued this any further than that.)

    What I did to fix that was to embed the variable in the
    DUMP-BABYL.INIT file as well.  This doesn't seem to me to be a great
    idea, since I don't know if that file is sent in a distribution, and
    furthermore it means that both locations have to be updated (there are
    comments in each location that points at the other).  I'm not sure if
    instead maybe DUMP-BABYL.INIT should read the contents of SITE.INIT or
    EMACS.INIT.  That seems to be the best way to solve the problem, but
    there might be a screw that I don't know about.  If nobody can think
    of one, I'll try that solution instead in a week or so.

The comments in DUMP-BABYL.INIT are wrong, EMACS.INIT isn't run by
TECO.INIT, what happens is that *Initialization* is set up to run
EMACS.INIT the first time ^R is entered.  But standalone BABYL has its
own *Initialization* routine, which is set up in DUMP-BABYL.INIT and
overwrites the normal *Initialization*.  DUMP-BABYL.INIT never enters
^R.  Thus EMACS.INIT (and SITE.INIT) are never run.  This last is
probably a bug.

The easiest thing would be to run EMACS.INIT explicitly from

Subject: New Babyl feature (BABYL.781)

I added code to make BABYL (optionally) modify the initial labels of
messages from a MAIL.TXT file based on the values of the well-known MM
bit flags.  Ie, I got tired of BABYL discarding information about which
messages I had already seen with MM.  MM's "FLAGGED" maps to RemindNow,
UNSEEN, ANSWERED, and DELETED map to the obvious, the rest are user
flags that can't be deciphered without the user's MM.INIT file so I
didn't try.  The code runs slower than I'd wish, but this is only an
issue if you're babylizing a MAIL.TXT file with a lot of messages, in
which case it's well worth the wait just to have UNSEEN handled right.

Installed on XX:<EMACS>BABYL.EMACS.781 and AI:EMACS1;BABYL 781.
Somebody should copy to OZ when it comes up after PM.

Someday somebody should fix the MM-MAIL library to grok these labels and
the Rcvd-Date header.

	I am a new graduate student out here. I don't really have a
bug to report but want to ask some information on Babyl.

	Is there a way to create a personal mailing list in Babyl? What I mean
is like the one in which a group of addresses can be reffered to by a
single short alias. And the same address can occur in many different
aliases of groups? Something like the one possible on the Unix mail
system.

	I have tried to look into XINFO and the EMACS mauals but the
closest to that I have found is  defining word abbreviations, which is
not the same because it expands into its full name as soon as you type
it.

	I believe that it should be possible easily because all the
groups here have their own mailing lists (Only difference being that
a group requires only one mailing list while there may be many
different personal mailing lists that keep changing).

	Thanks for the attention and advice in advance. I would be
very grateful if you could help.

I'll migrate BABYL.781 to OZ, probably Sunday night or maybe Monday.

I'll poke at MM-MAIL, but that probably won't happen until next
weekend at least.  It might be better for an MM user to do this, but
we'll see.

P.S.  Standalone Babyl on OZ does not read the user's init file.  I
can't remember whether the consensus was that this was a bug or not (I
think it is).  If other people also think this is a bug, I'll fix
that, too.  Could someone try it on XX at least and see if it works
there?  The ITSen?

For the last couple of days when I run Babyl (from inside Emacs on
Oz), it appends new messages to the beginning of my babyl file, even
though the file is set up to append at the end.  However, it doesn't
do this consistently.  For instance, if I do a GET new mail, then it
appends at the end, as it should.

I even created a whole new Babyl file, and the same problem ocurs.

This is very confusing;  does someone have a suggestion?

Thanks,

I installed what seems to be a broken version of Babyl over the
weekend.  It is now deinstalled until I can figure out what happened.
Since the bug (prepending instead of appending mail) is hard to repeat
(it works *most* of the time, but apparently not all), it may be a
while until I put the new version back.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

I just n'd my way through all five messages in your Babyl file.  No
problems.  I edited the file and looked for any weirdnesses---didn't
see any.  Did someone already fix this, or does it still break for
you?  If it does, what message does it break at?

(Incidentally, your current Babyl file says to prepend and reverse
incoming mail.  Is this the way you had it set before?  The new Babyl
I installed sporadically ignored appending information---I don't know
why---and I'm making sure that it didn't alter your Babyl file in the
process.  Thanks.)

I managed to fix it myself, by simply waiting for the five minutes
that it took to delete the funny message. This is why you didn't

should have kept it so you could see what it was. But, no matter,

The following Babyl problems have been reported by a local UTEXAS user

   Blais@R20.UTEXAS.EDU

1) Whenever I get mail from people around here with local SUNS (for
   example ctp@pop or fletcher@godzilla) and I try to answer their
   message, their address is put into the "TO:" field of the message
   properly (I use Babyl inside EMACS).  However, once the mail message
   is then sent, I get the infamous NIB error message ("you have
   addressed a character Not In the Buffer").  However, when I answer
   anyone's messages from other hosts, there's no problem.

   This is reproducible.  It only happens when I answer messages from
   these hosts, though.  If I initiate my own message to these hosts,
   things seem to work O.K.  So, whenever I do have to answer something
   from these people, I have to start my own message rather than "reply"
   to their's.

2) It seems that Babyl won't send mail to *any* of a list of intended
   recipients if it doesn't know how to get to one of them.

Sounds like a bug.  I've occasionally noticed that, under certain
conditions that I've never tracked down, the variable Space Indent

    Re:   Babyl reply to SUNS error

    The following Babyl problems have been reported by a local UTEXAS user
    to R20-STAFF@R20.UTEXAS.EDU.  I understand that these are known bugs that
    should be reported to BUG-BABYL@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU.  Please let us know if
    there is a solution.

    -- Donald Blais
       Blais@R20.UTEXAS.EDU

    1) Whenever I get mail from people around here with local SUNS (for
       example ctp@pop or fletcher@godzilla) and I try to answer their
       message, their address is put into the "TO:" field of the message
       properly (I use Babyl inside EMACS).  However, once the mail message
       is then sent, I get the infamous NIB error message ("you have
       addressed a character Not In the Buffer").  However, when I answer
       anyone's messages from other hosts, there's no problem.

       This is reproducible.  It only happens when I answer messages from
       these hosts, though.  If I initiate my own message to these hosts,
       things seem to work O.K.  So, whenever I do have to answer something
       from these people, I have to start my own message rather than "reply"
       to their's.

If this is a reproducable error, you should send a copy of a message
(headers only, don't need text) that can produce the problem.  Please
submit the unreformatted headers (use the 1H command).

    2) It seems that Babyl won't send mail to *any* of a list of intended
       recipients if it doesn't know how to get to one of them.

BABYL shouldn't be getting a visible NIB error, no matter how screwy
the header is.  At the very least the code causing this should be
inside an error trap.  

In general, when BABYL is completely unable to parse headers on a
reply command, it tells you this and asks if it should proceed and
give you the oportunity to fix things by hand.

Subject: Header parsing

It seems that, for reasons that are beyond me, Babyl's header parsing
routine (!& Parse Header:!, invoked by !# Babyl R:! to get recipients)
is groveling the reformatted headers instead of the original headers.

Some time ago I wrote some code to generate modern (Message-ID based)
In-Reply-To headers, eg, instead of

In-reply-to: Msg of 21 Dec 1987 17:49-EST from Rob Austein <SRA@XX.LCS.MIT.EDU>

it generates

In-Reply-To: <SRA.12360349550.BABYL@XX.LCS.MIT.EDU>

(if it can't find the Message-ID it falls back to the old style).

I don't usually want to see Message-IDs, so they are removed by
reformatting.  This causes me to always get old-style In-Reply-To.

Is there any good reason why I shouldn't fix this by making the header
parser look at the uncensored headers?

Subject: BBOARD.6

I added a few lines of code to the BBoard library to support
standalone BBOARD jobs (well, forks) without barfing when the BBoard
code exits to Babyl command level with an empty *Babyl* buffer.

Source code in the usual places on XX and AI, :EJ on XX only.  I
haven't installed a standalone BBOARD anywhere yet, because the
calling sequence into BABYL for such a beast is hairy.  I think the
code that handles this in XX:<SRA.LIB>ALICE.TECO is ok, but I'm not
confident enough to give it to TECO-illiterates just yet.

Someday somebody should make BBoard run on ITS.  The only hard parts
would be expanding BBoard Regular Naming Convention and figuring out
what to use for the timestamp instead of the Rcvd-Date headers.

Rob,

I solved the BBOARD stand-alone problem several years ago by creating
an instructional message in a Babyl file in EMACS: with no owner,
making it read-only.  Thus, BBOARD (known here as BBBOARD to
distinguish it from the regular BBOARD program) starts and ends in
that Babyl file, and not with an explicitly passed ^B.

I fixed a radix screwup in the code I added to translate MAIL.TXT bit
flags into Babyl labels.  The symptom was that a bit flag of ANSWERED
would be mangled into a label of "deleted" (whoops).  Fortunately, the
bit -> label conversion is turned off by default.

New BABYL.EMACS, BABYL.:EJ, and BABYL.EXE on XX, source only on AI.
ITS sites probably don't care about this, but any Twenex site that
snarfed a copy of BABYL recently should get this version pronto.

Apologies to anybody who got screwed by this.

After you type R to reply, type c-m-Y to yank the text of the original
message.  Normally I then edit out the parts I don't want to send but
in this case I left it all in to show you what the results look like.

BTW, all Babyl commands are emacs macros.  Babyl is a set of
subroutines running inside emacs.

I typed an explicit "From:" field in a message I sent using BABYL,
simply inserting something that had been in the reformatted "from:"
field of a message I had received.  I unconsciously assumed that
"From:" fields would be munged the same way that "To:" and "Cc:"
fields are, but obviously they are just passed on to COMSAT unmodified.

This seems like a bug to me; " at " should be changed to "@", as with
the other fields.

Fortunately, SRA has just told me about Babyl Reformation Control, which
I will set to 2, so I will stop seeing " at " from now on, which is
probably just as well.

I've (finally) found at least one way of reproducing the problem which
causes babyl to get pdl overflow.  It's kind of obvious in retrospect.
A minimal case is: from babyl top level, type c-r c-x r c-r c-x r c-r
c-x r ... a few times and it'll blow out.  

Now that's a dumb things to do.  What I actually do that causes the
bug is to do c-r to get some text from the message, then c-x b to
change to another buffer, do some editing there, and then want to go
back to babyl mail-reading mode.  I could switch back to the message
buffer and do c-], but c-x r seems easier and more natural (it means
"get me to mail reading mode" intuitively).  

So I think this is a genuine bug and ought to be fixed.  I can't
imagine that babyl bugs are high on anyone's priority queue nowadays,
though...

This must be a privately induced bug in your customized BABYL.  You
might want to check what functiono TAB is bound to (do <HELP>c<TAB>).
The instance of BABYL I'm typing this in has it bound to ^R Tab To Tab
Stop$, which works fine when I do it the straightforward way.  I
haven't messed with the binding of TAB, this is just the default
action for TAB in Text Mode.

xyz%foo.uucp@bar.edu.

I just want to type "xyz" in front of the To: line.

Can I do it?

Thanks in advance,
larry kolodney

Hello:
	In the past two weeks I've sent a couple of pieces of mail to
people outside the M. I. T. community, and gotten a massage back:

============ A copy of your message is being returned, because: ============
FOOS@BAR.GRILL.MUMBLE.ETC" at AI.AI.MIT.EDU is an unknown recipient.
============ Failed message follows: ============

	followed by the usual copy of my message. The odd thing is
that these messages, at least in some cases (haven't checked the
others), are getting through. One of these was to a .COM site, but was
kicked back _by COMSAT_.

	What gives? Is this a bogus error message, or is something
actually choking somewhere?

				Thanks,

				Robert Huff

The G command sometimes after reading in new mail does not make the
first message the current one.  (I think when it does this it always
makes the last new message be current, but I'm not positive of this.)
I have Append:0 and the default Babyl G Done Hook.
