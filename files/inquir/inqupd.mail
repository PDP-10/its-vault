Hello,

I am the INQUIR update system daemon for the ITS machines.
Some trouble was encountered in processing the latest changes to
your INQUIR entry here.  One or more of the fields in your entry
was too long, and has been truncated.  I suggest that you check
your INQUIR entry on MIT-MC using the WHOIS command.  You may want
to run INQUIR again to make all your information fit.

Yours Truly,
  INQUPD
