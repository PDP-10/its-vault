This is the root of the Macsyma documentation tree.  The following is a
description of the key Macsyma directories.  The file -READ- -TOO- on
any Macsyma directory will contain a description of the key files within
that directory.

MACSYM     Fasl files for the Macsyma in-core and out-of-core systems.
	   Mail to :BUG MACSYMA is kept in the file MACSYM MAIL.

MUNFAS     Unfasl files (compilation records) for Macsyma source files.

MAXSRC     Some Macsyma source files are kept here.  Others are kept in
	   private directories.

TRANSL     Macsyma Transl source files are kept here.

MAXOUT     Fasl files for Macsyma out-of-core splitfiles.  A single source
	   file will split into several of the files kept on this directory.

MAXDMP     Dumped versions of Macsyma are kept in MAXIMA >.  Also contains
	   other internal Macsyma databases.

MAXDEV     Directory for temporary storage of Macsyma source files which
	   are in an experimental or inconsistent state.  When work on a
	   file kept here is completed, it is moved to the installed source
	   location.  Changes to source files should be made to copies in
	   this directory and not to the installed versions.  Time critical
	   changes should be made to both copies.

MAXDOC     Documentation of information internal to Macsyma.  This information
	   is subject to change without notice and should not be relied upon by
	   non-group members.

MACDOC	   A repository of information of the INFO-MACSYM type.
	   I.e., documentation of interest to MACSYMA users is kept there.

MAXLNK     Contains links to all of the Macsyma source files.  This is used
	   for generating versions of Lisp Machine Macsyma and by other foreign
	   sites.

MAXTUL     Utility programs for maintaining Macsyma.
	   The MCL Macsyma Source Compiler is here.

MAXERR     String files for error messages.  First file name begins with 
	   the letter A through M.

MAXER1     String files for error messages.  First file name begins with 
	   the letter N through Z.

ALJABR     Utility programs for maintaining and installing Macsyma.
	   Extensions to the Lisp compiler for compiling Macsyma files are
	   in COMPLR >.  Mail to INFO-MACSYMA is in INFO MACSYM.  Updates 
	   for the manual are kept in UPDATE >.

LIBMAX     Source and fasl files for macro packages used in Macsyma.  Also
	   debugging tools and utility programs used by Macsyma system
	   programmers.

LMMAX	   Source and fasl files specific to Lisp Machine Macsyma.

LMMAXQ	   Lisp Machine fasl files of Macsyma files shared with the ITS
	   implementation. They correspond to entries in the MAXLNK directory.

EMAXIM     Macsyma Display Toplevel.  Still experimental.  Runs on both
	   ITS and the Lisp Machine.

NUMER	   Information and programs relating to the numerical evaluation
           of forms in Macsyma.

TEST	   Programs for testing Macsyma.  DEMO(SOLVE,TEST,TEST) will run
	   some test examples of the SOLVE program.

DEMO	   Programs for DEMOing features of Macsyma.

SHARE	   SHARE files for MACSYMA.

SHARE1	   More SHARE files for MACSYMA.

SHARE2	   More SHARE files for MACSYMA.

SHAREM	   SHARE macro files for MACSYMA.

For additional information about a given directory, see the file 
-READ- -TOO- on that directory.
