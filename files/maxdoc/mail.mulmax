       I am having a terrible time with MACSYMA on the MULTICS system
       doing something that does not seem that difficult.  The message given is:
       Fatal error.  Process has terminated.  Fault in signaller by user's process.
       New pprocess created.
       Then I am back at monitor level and cannot get back into the current 
       MACSYMA.  I have tried "start" and "program _interrupt" to no avail.

       Another message that I am getting is:
       Error: record_quota_overflow condition by lisp_gc_alm ....

       I have tried unbinding by killing labels, etc. to no avail.  Any suggestions
       would be greatly appreciated.  My mail address is Mejia at MIT-MULTICS.

You have the Multics equivalent of MC's running out of core, except worse.
On Multics, you have an address space which is limited by your authorized quota.
It needs to be enlarged to run the calculation, apparently. Send multics mail
to RBurke.SysAdmin and ask him to increase your record quota so that you can run
the problem. The fatal error message and new process creation wipes out the entire
state that you had previously, including any editing in progress inside an emacs,
say, that you also had before starting the macsyma - it is like logging out and logging
back in again. Thus start and pi do nothing, since there is nothing to go back to.
You might also have a bug in the lisp garbage collector coming to light, though that
is a lot less probable. You can send mail to Harten.Paradigm at multics if you would
like an opinion on the calculation that you are attempting there.

The .macsyma extension:  yet another winning feature of multics macsyma.
At least the add_name command can keep the old filename around easily;
e.g.  an foo.1 ===.macsyma creates foo.1.macsyma as another name for
foo.1, and then the files that have setup_autoload (which does work with
the .macsyma extension) should be edited to include the extension.  Does
that solve all of the problems, Mel?

    message about an unbound variable occurs.  I presume that the LISP
    reader is getting called on foo(x,y):=x+y in the file because it
    complains about foo being unbound.  The use of BATCH and BATCHLOAD on
    such files is ok.  SETUP_AUTOLOAD calls LOAD, apparently, rather than
    BATCHLOAD, and so loses as well.

There is nothing wrong with LOAD.  In this implementation, it needs
a file extension of ".macsyma" to tell it to that the file is macsyma
type.  Try renaming temp.mac to temp.macsyma.  It will then behave properly.
  
I verified this with direct calls to LOAD, but I didn't actually use
SETUP_AUTOLOAD.

Obviously, autoloading is supposed to be handled by LOAD.  Your diagnosis 
has apparently proven that the bug is in LOAD and not in SETUP_AUTOLOAD. 
It is LOAD's job to differentiate between a BATCH file and a Lisp-readable 
file and it sounds like this part of LOAD is broken on Multics.

Based on DOE-MACSYMA timing on a vax-750, I expected about 10-20 cpu
seconds on Multics.  Instead, it seems to have gotten into an infinite
loop which I can't break out of, and the operator had to log me off from
the console (i.e., only try this during attended service hours.)

The autoloading facility is acting very broken on the Multics System.
This has more than a slight impact on yours truly.  Could someone fix
it.?

Enclosed is an example of a perfectly good file which doesn't auto-
load.  I don't believe it is a problem with my programming since quite a
few files of mine do load fine which look similar to this one.

Re. your recent mail:
(You may know this, but:)
There are basically two different approaches to matrix inversion in 
MACSYMA:  M^^-1 and INVERT(M).  Sometimes one of these may win over the 
other.  (The former uses a Gaussian elimination method, the latter an 
adjoint method usually better for floating point entries.  I don't know 
if the INVERT command is available in Multics MACSYMA.)
Also it is usually pretty easy to check the correctness of an answer: 
just re-invert.  If M2:M^^-1$, does M2^^-1 give back something that looks 
like M?  I don't know if you tried this.

I am inverting a 20x20 matrix consisting only of numbers.When done with keepfloat true, a very improbably result occurs.  When keepfloat is false, and then float(the answer) is taken,a completely different and much more believable answer is given.The matrix consists of floating point numbers from around -12 to 12on several diagonals (with a majority of the terms =0), whereeach nonzero number has a full eight arbitrary digits after thedecimal point. Perhaps this is just a limitation of the accuracyof floating point calculations.

You can get the correct form with EXPAND.  I think your target form is

              -(%pi/3-3*atan(7/4)/(2*sqrt(3)))/2-%pi/6


How can I get the above to simplify to soemthing more reasonable, i.e.,

-(%pi/3)-(2*atan(7/4))/(4*sqrt(3))

which is the same thing?

   I would appreciate if you could let me know how it is possible
   to simplify general boolean expressions, eg. something like
   A AND (NOT(A) OR B) would simplify to A AND B
There is nothing built into MACSYMA for doing this.  But I don't see why 
this should be hard for you to program yourself in MACSYMA.  I also don't 
see that MACSYMA has any special advantage here.  I.e. you can also do it 
probably just as easily in Lisp or Prolog or ...  .

    I am trying to substitute the three equations a,b, and c 
    into the equation neweqtn, using the lratsubst command. 
    This can be seen above in 

    lratsubst(['DIFF(ut(t[n+1]),e,1) = gamat(t[n+1]),
	       'DIFF(ut(t[n]),e,1) = gamat(n),
	       'DIFF(f(t[n+1],t[n]),e,1) = lamdat(n+1,n)],
	       'DIFF(ut(t[n+1]) = m(dt)*(delta[ns]*(k*nu-e*h*k*gamat(s))+ut(t[n]))-f(t[n+1],t[n]),e,1))
    but it seems that the command is not working.  Is there another way of doing this?
Use ratsubst repeatedly, but of course, you can't use equations.

But your problem will encounter other difficulties, relating to
your use of nounified deriviatives in the last arg of lratsubst.
The "'" prevents the diff from moving down through the equation,
which means that the forms that you want to substitute for will never
arise.  If you don't use the quote, you have worse trouble, unless
you declare dependencies on E.

Read about DEPENDS, "'", DIFF and RATSUBST, using DESCRIBE or in the
manual.

   Is it possible to get MACSYMA to explain how it solved an integral?
No.  Unfortunately, no such code exists.  (But it would be neat to add 
explanation code to MACSYMA now that we are no longer restricted by address 
space limitations!)  We may be able to provide an explanation, however, for 
a particular example either by what we already know or by tracing through

    I am having trouble getting contour plots on the multics macsyma.  I
    tried to get a contour plot using plot3d(...,contour),but that did not
    work.  When I tried a straight plot3d example from the referance manual,
    I got an undefined function message.Does plot3d work on multics?  If
    not, do you know the best way for me to get contour plots?  Thank you
    very much.

                                       Kathy Misovec

I'm sorry, but the plot3d implementation for Multics is quite a bit
different from the one documented in the manual.
The multics version has the following calling sequence:
plot3d(f(x,y),x,x_low,x_hi,y,y_low,y_hi,theta,phi);

theta and phi are angles that decribe the angle from which to view
the plot. Unfortunately, I cannot remember the definition of the angles,
and no longer have the required access to check the code.

The error message you mention has been corrected in the source and the
fix will appear in the next release of Multics Macsyma.

Let me know if I can help any more,

    Obviously there is a bug here in Multics Macsyma, but it is trying to 
    print out an error message to you.  So, you are using Plot3d incorrectly 
    somehow.  Perhaps you can spot what you are doing wrong.

JPG is correct. This bug has been corrected for the next version of
Multics MACSYMA. PLOT3D expects arguments like 
PLOT3D(FUN,X,XMIN,XMAX,Y,YMIN,THETA,PHI);
Where THETA and PHI are angles of rotation. I don't have access to
this code and cannot check on the exact description of the angles.
They maybe described by doing
help macsyma
at multics command level.

   Ok, but having got one, can one recover, or does one have to (quit) and
   start MACSYMA again?  By the way, the SOLVE examples causes a pdl
   overflow on the first example (at least on MULTICS).

   How can one fix things when one gets a pdl overflow?
These are usually caused by recursive infinite loops in your own 
code.  If so, some debugging on your part may be in order.

Thanks for the bug report on plot3d.
While you do get the undefined function error. The reason for called
*merror-1 is that you called plot3d incorrectly. The calling sequence is
plot3d(sin(x*y),x,-6,6,y,-6,6,THETA,PHI)

    It seems that the SETUP_AUTOLOAD(["filename"], cmd1,cmd2,...cmdi); goes
    into an infinite BATCHing loop if cmd1 does not exist in the specified
    filename.  This is a bit disheartening especially when calling from a
    personal computer with a pporly instrumented break key.


    It appens often that one misspells the command in the file to be
    automatically batched and thus the problem.
I have verified this problem and will try to get it fixed for the next
Macsyma version on Multics.

It appears that the bessel function (and related functions) are not
available in Multics macsyma.  Is this true?  Is there an alternative
method for computing bessel functions?  We have several users who
require this.

    You have mail. :rint_mail

    r 06:46 3.306 183



    Some of the characters in the tranmission are missing because of
    the speed of my micro, but that's the form of the problem,
    basically. I can do it again and record it in some other form if you'd
    like.
This is a very simple bug to correct and diagnose.
You have run out of disk space to support virtual memory.
You should contact Bobby Burke or Roger Roach and ask them to
increase the size of your process directory to 2048 records.
That size should be adequate for most "Normal" problems.
If you need space beyond that you will have to make some
special arrangements to run large problems.

I am unaware of another way to obtain the same functionality, Sorry.

Some of the characters in the tranmission are missing because of
the speed of my micro, but that's the form of the problem,
basically. I can do it again and record it in some other form if you'd
like.

Subject:  MACSYMA SAVVE command on Multics
To:  Multics-Macsyma-Bugs@MIT-MC.ARPA
Message-ID:  <840510163709.858071@MIT-MULTICS.ARPA>

This is Rick Whitaker, from McDonnell-Douglas Corporation in St.  Louis,
MO.  I used SAVE to attempt to save the results of a 2 hour session on
MACSYMA.  The exact command entered was save([orseqn],all) .  The system
responded with a list consisting of orseqn followed by all of my command
and display line numbers and all of the variables I had worked with.
Thus, I assumed that the file was really there.  In fact, I did a files
command back in Multics and the file is really there.  When I came back
this morning and LOADed the file back in, nothing was there.  I then
tried LOADFILE, but to no avail.  When I got back into Multics I tried
to look at the file and got a message that the Segment length was ZERO.
This is certainly not satisfactory and a disappointment to me as I
forsee the need to stop and mull over results before blindly moving
ahead.  I realize that the Multics version is apparently under
development, but it seems that there are some rather nasty bugs that
make it much less useful than need be.  Is there any way that I can
check to be sure that my SAVEd files are really there before I leave
MACSYMA and loose everything?  What if there is a way to check and I
find the file is empty as was the case here?  Please respond as soon as
possible as I am embarking on some rather important work for our
aerodynamics people and I would very much like to see it be a success
for the future of MACSYMA here at MDC.  Thanks.  Also, it is not very
satisfactory to rack-up significant charges getting things pushed to a
certain point, only to discover that it has to be done over.  Oh, by the
way, I have successfully used SAVE with the syntax
   save([filename],fn1,fn2,fn3,...,fnk,var1,...,varn) before.  Also, I
find that playback() doesn't seem to do all of the things it is supposed
to do.  Thanks for any help you can offer me.

       Indeed, the error I encountered yesterday was a complaint
       from the LISP subsystem that the function ALLROOTS
       was missing. If it is not implemented, why do SOLVE
       and ALGSYS call it?
   Its a bug in Multics Macsyma.

       If there is a workaround, I'd appreciate
       knowing it. Is there some switch to set, or some
       way of using the SOLVE and ALGSYS functions so this will
       not happen?
   You might try algexact:true I believe that this will prevent
   some calls to ALLROOTS.

       I managed to get the problem solved yesterday, albeit
       in an indirect way ... Are there any plans to fix
       this omission? Shouldn't ALGSYS and SOLVE at least
       restrict their domains so this problem will not surface?
   When resources permit, we will port ALLROOTS to Multics.
You can also set REALONLY:TRUE$ if you wish, but obviously this mode 
is not useful if you are expecting complex solutions.

    From: RWhitaker@MIT-MULTICS.ARPA
    Status: RO

    Please see that Jim O'Dell sees this message.  I am working on MACSYMA
    on Multics and am concerned about some of the differences that aren't
    well documented in the MACSYMA Reference Manual.  In particular, I have
    had problems with control characters, loading demo files, using SEND and
    BUGS, and today I discovered TRIGSIMP() isn't working (it was a week or
    so ago as I used it during one session).
I can find no evidence that it has ever been implemented on Multics. Are
you sure that you weren't using the MC version?

  Here are some of the details.
    CTRL/x,z,g,h all appear to work as indicated.  CTRL/k,l,y,] don't seem
    to work at all.  I believe ] just goes into a wait and the others tell
    me they aren't acceptable to LISP as control characters.  I haven't
    explored some of the other control characters as I was quite bewildered
    by what had gone on with the ones I've tried.
I believe that you'll find the control character stuff cleared up by the
"Using Macsyma on Multics" document. It is true that most of the ITS
control characters do not work on Multics Macsyma.

    Now, the story on file loading.  One specific example I tried just today
    was to load the demo file for TRIGSIMP ...  not that I needed to see it,
    but as mentioned above, TRIGSIMP didn't work for me, so I thought I'd
    run the demo to see if it failed also.  Well, I couldn't even get it
    loaded.  Other LOADing problems have concerned SHARE files.  Also, I
    have tried saving files with say, SAVE(cheb,mac) and I don't get a file
    named cheb.mac .  In fact, I seem to remember that I got a file named
    cheb.
I believe that the "Using Macsyma on Multics" document will clear up
filename conventions also, basically you say
save(["foo.macsyma"],options);
for Multics macsyma.

    Now, the story on SEND and BUGS is this.  I type BUGS("my message") or
    SEND("my message") and I get zoomed out of MACSYMA.  A message
    indicating incompatibility with qedx, or some such thing is printed, and
    then I get the prompt send_mail:  .  At such point, I did not know what
    to do.
This is a recent incompatible change to the send_mail program on Multics
and will be fixed in the next release of Multics MACSYMA. In the tile
being you can certainly send mail using the sdm command directly.

    The story with TRIGSIMP is also fairly bizarre.  I tried the following:

		     TRIGSIMP((tan(x)+c)/sec(x));

    and I got my command line echoed back on the display line.  I might live
    with that if I hadn't had a listing right in front of me with the EXACT
    SAME INPUT with the response
		     sin(x) + c cos(x)
I have no idea about this I looked at the directory >lib>macsyma>share
and could find no sign of TRGSMP. If this is critical to your operation
I can provide you with a copy of the file for you to use personally.
copy the file >udd>SMI>jim>trgsmp.macsyma to your home directory load
it and the trigsimp command should work.

    What is going on?  Is MACSYMA being worked on?  Did someone forget to
    load up the trig routines?

    I have been trying to put together a course on MACSYMA to teach to my
    colleagues here at McDonnell Douglas Corporation in St.  Louis.  These
    problems have gotten to be a little frustrating.  Especially the
    TRIGSIMP problem, as I was cleaning up an example I had already worked
    previously.  Any information you can give me on these problems would be
    very helpful.  Is there a way to get a list of known bugs in Multics
    MACSYMA?  I have some manuals on order for the Multics operating system

Subject:  MACSYMA on Multics
To:  Multics-Macsyma-Bugs@MIT-MC.ARPA
Message-ID:  <840404011653.142915@MIT-MULTICS.ARPA>

Please see that Jim O'Dell sees this message.  I am working on MACSYMA
on Multics and am concerned about some of the differences that aren't
well documented in the MACSYMA Reference Manual.  In particular, I have
had problems with control characters, loading demo files, using SEND and
BUGS, and today I discovered TRIGSIMP() isn't working (it was a week or
so ago as I used it during one session).  Here are some of the details.
CTRL/x,z,g,h all appear to work as indicated.  CTRL/k,l,y,] don't seem
to work at all.  I believe ] just goes into a wait and the others tell
me they aren't acceptable to LISP as control characters.  I haven't
explored some of the other control characters as I was quite bewildered
by what had gone on with the ones I've tried.

Now, the story on file loading.  One specific example I tried just today
was to load the demo file for TRIGSIMP ...  not that I needed to see it,
but as mentioned above, TRIGSIMP didn't work for me, so I thought I'd
run the demo to see if it failed also.  Well, I couldn't even get it
loaded.  Other LOADing problems have concerned SHARE files.  Also, I
have tried saving files with say, SAVE(cheb,mac) and I don't get a file
named cheb.mac .  In fact, I seem to remember that I got a file named
cheb.

Now, the story on SEND and BUGS is this.  I type BUGS("my message") or
SEND("my message") and I get zoomed out of MACSYMA.  A message
indicating incompatibility with qedx, or some such thing is printed, and
then I get the prompt send_mail:  .  At such point, I did not know what
to do.

The story with TRIGSIMP is also fairly bizarre.  I tried the following:

                 TRIGSIMP((tan(x)+c)/sec(x));

and I got my command line echoed back on the display line.  I might live
with that if I hadn't had a listing right in front of me with the EXACT
SAME INPUT with the response
                 sin(x) + c cos(x)

What is going on?  Is MACSYMA being worked on?  Did someone forget to
load up the trig routines?

I have been trying to put together a course on MACSYMA to teach to my
colleagues here at McDonnell Douglas Corporation in St.  Louis.  These
problems have gotten to be a little frustrating.  Especially the
TRIGSIMP problem, as I was cleaning up an example I had already worked
previously.  Any information you can give me on these problems would be
very helpful.  Is there a way to get a list of known bugs in Multics
MACSYMA?  I have some manuals on order for the Multics operating system
and I hope they will help me unravel some of the file problems - by
trial and error if nothing else.  However, there isn't much I can do
about the control character problems, etc.  That is, in the way of
getting around them.

Thanks for your help.  Hope to hear from you very soon.

The Multics Macsyma SEND and BUG requests don't specify "-no_request_loop"
in their "send_mail" command lines.  The default when a -input_file
is specified is to give the user the "send_mail:" prompt, which
you probably don't want.  This was an incompatible change made in the
recent installation of send_mail, which is confusing our users alot.

   To:  jpg@MIT-MC.ARPA
   Dear Mr. Golden,
   Thank you for your prompt reply.
   I was actually looking for what turned out to be the dot operator, i.e.,
   the true matrix multiply. I left my Macsyma manual at work, and had a
   quick one to run, so did it from home. (I guess I should order another 
   copy.)
   Sorry for no example: The case in question was an attempt to do A*B
   where A was a 4x4 matrix, and B a 4x1 matrix (column vector).

   Since then, I've even found that Macsyma has something like an on-line
   help these days. I guess I've gotten so used to using the Yellow Book,
   that I haven't kept up.

   Thanks again,

   J.T.Galkowski

See, commercial types do use Macsyma on Multics.

`graphic 1,35 `shrink sg -table tek_4013     (singce tek_4025 in not a
recognized set_up craphics) macsyma multgraph:true; plotmode:'tek;
tek4025:true; plot2(sin(x),x,-%pi,%pi);

The macsyma responese in mot any plot that I can see, but only an echo
of the plot command. What am I cdoo doing wrong. As far as I can tekll,
for example, I can only scrooll in the monitor, not in the workspace.

Thank you.

    plot2 and plot3 are not treated as known functions, ie theyare returned exactly as they are sent in rather than beeing executed.
The correct functions on Multics are:
plot(f(x),x,low,high) and
plot3d(f(x,y),x,0,1,y,0,1,theta,phi);

theta and phi are the angles to view the plot from.

Thanks for the bug report. This bug is a known problkem with Multics
Macsyma and will be fixed in the next release. For the time being 
you can avoid the bug by giving plot3d the correct number of arguments.
In addition to the ones you gave already it expects two more

   Solve is acting very strangely...
You forward a rather large expression and say 'Solve is acting very 
strangely.'  You do not say what ARGUMENTS you called SOLVE on (you only 
give one) so we do not know what you are trying to solve for.  Also, 
did you experiment with smaller expressions to see if SOLVE again acts 
strangely and also to give yourself a better feel for what SOLVE is 
doing?  Perhaps SOLVE simply cannot solve your problem?

The variable XY is a varible internal to the definite integration routines.
If you see in an answer or get asked about it you have run into a bug.

We would certainly appreciate seeing the problem that caused this behavior.

As to the other problems that you have asked to be integrated, if you
wanted you can send them in also for evaluation. No promises on geting
macsyma to do them tho'

I am using the ev command: ev(%,integrate) to evaluate a doubleintegral.  It asks me about the nature of some of the expressions (positive,negative or zero?) that are in the integral, but it also asks about xyor xy-1, etc. which are not characters that I have used.  What's going on.Incedentally, it is not able to evaluate any of the integrals which I havelabeled f1,f2,g1,and g2.

Subject: The argument of RETURN.
Cc: asb@scrc-cupid

Perhaps it could be clearer, but on page 2-19, it says that the value of
the block is either the value of the last statement or the value of the
argument to RETURN.  What this means is that you should arrange things
so that the last statement evaluates to whatever it is that you want the block
to calculate, or if you use  RETURN, its argument should be the thing you
want the block to give you.  So it's difficult to "say what the argument
of return is", because it depends on your specific needs.  Hope this helps.

I can NOT solve system of diff eq'ns using 'ODE' or 'ODE2'. Thearguments for them can NOT handle arrays. Then, I tried 'DESOLVE' but itdid NOT work either, in fact, it did NOT even solve the example given inpage 6-32 in the manual. My problem consists of a system of coupled, nonhomogeneous, linear diff eq'ns. The system describes the physical behaviorof a mechanical structure. There is one equation per each degree of freedom,however they are coupled, and there is a forcing function, i.e. the nonhomogeneous term. In matrices the problem becomes:           [M]{X2} + [C]{X1} + [K]{X} = {F}where [M], [C], [K] are the mass, damping and stiffness matrices respectively.{F} is the forcing function. {X2} is the acceleration, i.e. the 2nd. derivativeof the displacement, {X1} is the velocity, i.e. the 1st derivative of the displacement, and {X} is the displacement. I have been trying to solve this problemfor more than a week, and I am beginning to demoralize. That is why I implorefor your help. Even if I could use 'DESOLVE', it is not very convenient, becausesolving the problem using the matrices and vectors is much more efficient,easier and faster. As I said before, I tried 'ODE', 'ODE2', and 'DESOLVE' buteither they can not take arrays, or they 'can't handle it', however the latteris impossible since I input the simplest system of eq'ns that you can dream of.So simple in fact, that I could solve it by hand in a few seconds, there wereonly two eqn's hardly coupled and with constant coefficients, and the inputwas a simple sinusoid. Now, looking forward to reading from you. By the way,I do NOT have experience using this system, and even less experience usingMACSYMA, however I DID try hard. Thank you very much!!!

ODE2 solves 'elementary' odes of first and second order.
ODE includes ODE2 and other techniques.
DESCRIBE(ODE2); and DESCRIBE(ODE); in new_macsyma should give you more info 
about them.
You don't need an ODE1 as that is included by calling ODE2 or ODE.
There is no ODE3.  I don't believe there is anyone looking into solving 
higher than 2nd order equations.  There are efforts under way to improve the 
solution of 2nd order de's which define special functions.  Users have

Expanding on the preceding question. I know how to solve single 2nd    order diff eqns in Macsyma. The problem is that I do not know how to solve a    system of coupled diff eqns, say 3 of them. Finally, I have two more questions: (1) What is the difference between the operatos ode( ) and ode2( ), and can     there be other operators like ode1( ) or ode3( )?

   In the file share;vect >  scalarp is redefined.  It is a system 
   function.  Several place in Macsyma call (args '$scalarp ()) to make 
   lisp forget the number of args that $SCALARP used to take.  The problem 
   is that on Multics this form is meaningless.  I guess for Multics we 
   should execute the form (args '$scalarp '(0 . 511)) .
   Maybe easier to just redefine the function $SCALARP in VECT?
The function in SHARE;VECT is now called VSCALARP per your suggestion.

   batch([">lib>macsyma>share>cartan.start"],on,2,9);
   I believe that it should be
   batch([">lib>macsyma>share>cartan.start"],on,1,8);
has been fixed in the source on MC.  I also took out the 'on' as 
it is no longer necessary.
   
   Also the documentation gives the filename not as above
   but in ITS style filenames. I don't know if we have a
   general solution to this problem.
No general solution at this time.  So, the file now contains a specialized 
solution, specialized to ITS and Multics where the current users of the 
file reside.

   How do I write the ITS command batch([cartan,start,dsk,share2],on,
   2,9) in multics macsyma?  I am especially concerned about the on, 2, 9
   part of the command.
The correct syntax for Multics is:
batch([">lib>macsyma>share>cartan.start"],on,2,9) .
I.e. you must type the brackets.  If you don't, it'll think you mean the 
simple Batch format described in the manual in which case the 'on,2,9'
will be considered to be part of the filename.
I think this should be documented better in the Multics section of the 
manual.

----------------
If you are absolutely sure that the method you are using to do your
problem is correct AND efficient then you can ask for lisp to store its
stuff in your personal directory. Note that your personal directory must
still have the quota necessary to store all lisp data structures. 

If you can give us some idea of the type of problem you are trying to
do (i.e. provide a batch file), we might be able to ascertain whether
what you are trying to do is feasible before you spend a lot of money
trying to do an impossible computation.

Send us the name of the appropriate batch file(s), set
the ACL's correctly and we'll take a look at it for you.

    On Multics, using both old and new versions, it does not seem to be
    possible for you to get macsyma to put it's often-substantial temporary
    storage into a specified directory instead of the default one (ie your
    process_dir). What happens is that macsyma says
	      macsyma: The lisp temp dir you have initialized is not the one expected. Do you wish to terminate it?

    If you answer yes, it puts the temporary segments in the pdir. If you
    answer no, it drops you out of macsyma.

    This is particul;arly unfortunate, since to increase your process dir
    quota (which is set to 1024 records by default, a number macsyma can
    easily overuse) requires the intervention of either a project or a
    systems administrator, with the attendant waste of time...

The lisp_set_temp_dir command has to be given before ANY lisp's are
started in the current process (Remember EMACS). I believe that if you
do it as the first command in your process you'll win.

       What Mellis means is that trying to use "describe" from standard multics
       macsyma (not new_macsyma), yields the error message "Cannot find Macsyma
       Manual Index" or something like that.  I mentioned this to Jim O'Dell a
       month or two ago and he said something about installations but this was
       never fixed.  Could somebody please look into this?
    No one has reported this to Multics-Macsyma-Bugs before.  Jim tells me 
    that the new Multics Macsyma installation is very imminent, and this 
    should fix this and many other problems.  Apparently this installation 
    was held up recently by Peter Kelley being out sick.
Yes, I was aware of this bug. It was caused by a disk crash at Multics
damaging one of the files describe uses. Hopefully new_macsyma will be
installed soon.

    How can I create a human readable transcript of my
    session?  MACSYMA does not seem to accept WRITEFILE as described in
    the manual.
I do the following to get a human readable output of my session

writefile();

(MY session stuff)

closefile(session_name);

Where session name is the name of the file.

   The STRINGOUT function in Multics Macsyma doen't work correctly.
   In version 297 it gets "call to an undefined function CNAMEF"
   according to Pandava.
This problem was fixed some time ago in the source.  So, it'll be fixed on 
Multics whenever a new version of Macsyma gets released there.

   Following up my question on multivariate TAYLOR, the following:
   taylor(sin(x+y-z),[x,y,z],[0,0,1],2)
   returns  [x,x,x-1]+[y,y,y-1]-[z,z,z-1]
   What I really wanted was an expansion around x=0, y=0, z=1.
This does work at MIT-MC, so it should be making its appearance on 
Multics within say two months.

   (1) Using TAYLOR multivariate form, with the third argument a list of 
   same length as the second, the results are unexpected ... in one case, 
   a list of the form [var1-v0[1],var1-v0[2],...] showed up where I should 
   have had just (var1-v0[1]). It seems OK when the third argument is an 
   atom.
You give no actual example so there is nothing for us to check out.  Some 
improvement in this area has been made in TAYLOR recently, and this should 
show up on Multics when there is a new release of Macsyma there within a 
couple of months.

   (2) FORTRAN:TRUE does not seem to work.
FORTRAN is no longer a switch but a function.
Try e.g. FORTRAN(X^2); .

   How do I get ITENSR?
ITENSR is not available on Multics at this time.  We hope it will be 
available in the next release of Macsyma on Multics to happen soon.
(In less than two months anyway.  JIM: Can you get ITENSR onto 
Multics any sooner?)
