* Topic:		Symbol reaping in incore Macsyma

  Re:			7,000 Macsyma words
			A year or two ago, when I was doing that symbol
			reaping stuff, I wound up deciding that the only way
			to recover the symbol segments was to bind the fasl
			files constituting the in-core system into a single
			module with uuo links pre-smashed.  Recently I've
			written code which is capable of doing that.  It would
			take me perhaps another week or two to make this into
			a winning Macsyma, with automatic recovery of
			accidently reaped symbols, etc.  However, I still have
			NIL to work on, so I won't spend further time on this
			now.  If you feel that work on this should continue
			and have some ideas as to who could do it and when,
			I'll be glad to help.

* Topic:		Automatic Formatting of Macsyma Batch Files
  Persons-Requesting:	PAULW
  Description:		Something like the LISP grind function which could
			reformat a batch file in better format.

* Topic:		Load Function
  Persons-Requesting:	
  Description:		A function which can heuristically determine the
			language of a file (FASL, LISP, or MACSYM) and load
			it correctly.

* Topic:		Save-File Printer
  Persons-Requesting:	
  Description:		A function to print out save files in Macsyma form.
			This should loop doing Lisp READs from the file,
			determining if the form is a Macsyma expression or
			Lisp internal stuff (such as ADD2LNC onto LABELS, etc)
			and print out the stuff in a form useful to the user
			for determining what the file was about.

* Topic:		Generalized DO
  Date-Entered:		9-Apr-81
  Persons-To-Contact:	GJC, RLB
  Description:		Something that does more than the current DO ...
			Keywords allowing multiple steppers, exit clauses,
			etc. RLB hacked something up on this line ages ago.
			Where did it go?
