Apparently my message about the auditron living in my desk drawer
was minunderstood:  the auditron is not missing now, it is in my
desk drawer.  Anne Schmitt has indicated that it tends to disappear
(and not down to GJC's office, just "gone") from her desk, and she
is no longer going to keep that box with auditrons there.  Hence we
should find a home for it, and I have put it in my desk.  Let's all
try to remember to return it there.

The Mathlab/PlasmaPhysics Lispmachines both have working macsyma's,
and *now* they have working supdup servers, which means that anyone
on the NET can connect to them and run macsyma [oh joy of joys]. 
The lispmachine macsyma has features not available on other machines,
(that is until NIL macsyma is brought on-line).
[1] A new parser, which reads from a rubout-handler that has screen-editing
    commands, makes input a lot easier.
[2] A DISPLAY-EDITOR, which makes it easier to do subtle simplifications.
[3] An in-core macsyma translator and lisp compiler, makes it faster and
    easier to run large macsyma programs.
[4] Large address space and lots of core, makes some problems run
    faster than on MC. (Did I say *faster* than our beloved KL-10? Yes, I did.)
    Some things run slower of course, have fun trying your favorite problem.

I would like to thank you all for all kind help during the
wonderful year+ I spent in Cambridge (whereof 1/3 year logged-on)
It was also very stimulating with lotsa other night-owls around
- here in Stockholm I'm often alone on the machines during nights
Had as usual not time to write mail-stuff like this before leaving
last christmas.
[- during the last 60-72h I instead completed eg some TRIGSUM-changes,
   brought most recent STENSR on tape,  and then drew off from
   Boston some h before the plane would leave from Kennedy/NY
  -Didn't get many miles/gallon_coffe on that drive but managed
   to stay awake.  The van was also luckily shipped afterwards]

Some of the things going on here in Stockholm:
* The use of Maclisp is increasing.
* In Pascal an editor "AMIS", exactly compatible to a growing
  subset of EMACS, is being implemented for TOPS-10.
* A message/mail-system "COM" is developed here, which stores
  all messages *centrally*, ie not one for each person, and
  instead knows which msgs you have seen (in lists you're on).
  It has eg commands for moving up/down along message-chains
  that are comments to each other (uses internal pointers),
  and many other nice things.
Much of Scandinavia uses COM in Stockholm, so if you want
to reach somebody, I might be able to forward.
   I've had several technical problems to solve but am now connecting
to MC each weekend. Have arranged with an electronic switch-box
that connects terminal and 2 machines (MC and local) in any combi-
nation; eg this was pre-made and transfered from our local machine.
Best wishes to you all,

    Tom Lightburn is having Diane (his assistant) look into the cost of
    having the heat on at least until 9:00 pm.  It is outrageously expensive,
    though (he was saying $100 per hour is what CC&F charges).  Space heaters
    are a safety hazard, especially since the wiring in this building is not
    adequate (he also says).  In any case, the problem is under investigation,
    and I can only suggest long underwear, sweaters, and gloves.
Right.  Lessee, here, now.  If 12 of us can't type with gloves on our fingers,
that's $100/hour in salaries wasted right there.  Not to count waste of
overhead, employers part of Social Security withholding, cancelled research
contracts because the work isn't being done and because people would rather
work for private industry where they get $6000 more in salary, better fringe
benifits, and to top it all off, a warm office!

Now, indeed, it isn't ALWAYS too cold.  Sometimes it's too hot.  There were
many times last summer when I left because I couldn't take the heat.

It's a lot worse on weekends, when it's off for a longer period.  Perhaps one
approach is to turn it on, say, from 11 pm to 1 am, and then let it coast.  If
CC&F would stil lcharge the same rate for this, we'd get more ergs of heat for
the same $, and improve the minimum a lot more.  Perhaps also add in 4-5 am,
and delay the current 7am turnon to 8am (since it will be warmer, it won't take
as long to get it up to temperature).

I don't know about the permanence of the location, and I also don't
know about locking doors.  However, the 8th floor lobby door is locked
from 5:00 pm to 9:00 am weekdays and all day weekends.  All Mathlab
offices are keyed to be one lock.  So presumably you would need two
keys, one lobby master and one Mathlab master.  LCS does not give keys
to people who do not have offices in the building without the signature
of one of the associate directors of the laboratory, and the faculty
person in charge of the group issuing the key.  So you need to get a
key card from Gerry Brown on the fourth floor of 545 Tech Square and
then get it signed by JM and either Mike Hammer or Al Meyer.
