   There seems to be a problem with MACSYMA's function ALLROOTS.
   1) when given a polynomial with real coefficients it does not find
   any of the complex roots regardless of the setting of the switch POLYFACTOR
   2) even when factor a simple complex polynomial the results are incorrect.
   ALLROOTS((X-%i)^2) does not give [x=%i].
   3) the examples given in the reference manual do not work either.
This all works as expected on MC.
Note on (2): As DESCRIBE(ALLROOTS); on MC points out, you lose accuracy 
with ALLROOTS when you call it on a problem with multiple roots.
If you wanted an exact answer here, you could use SOLVE.

incorparate SOME of the nice features of Multics. Thats the
trouble with all of the new MINI-computer OS's. They ALL steal
PART of MULTICS and as a result they lose.

Well anyway Multics has the very same facilities your VAX does.
Lisp can call out to Aribitray PL1, FORTRAN, even COBOL code.
It could iterface with data base systems.

Hi,This is Sofia Chernin, Chernin.ARCS.
I think i found way to pass values from the Multics segment to Macsyma.
I managed to pass only one column . To do it i had to edit my file.
For example my data looked like
1
2
3
to pass it to Macsyma i had to edit it so that it looked like
a:[1,
2,
3]
Of course i inderstand that it is very clumsy way to do it, but it is possible
to write an edit macro, that will do the editing.
And it's possible to split the file, that consists from several rows of data
(like
1 2 3
2 3 4
2 3 4)
into several files consisting from one column every.
Thanks to everybody for the help.
I am going to give a seminar on Macsyma today, and am a little nervous.

I think that you would find the macsyma-fortran interface to be
quite difficult to work with on multics or mit-mc.  If your objective
is to use the macsyma graphics package, I think you should first
look around at other possibilities on multics.
  I believe the situation with regard to interchange of data is
substantially better on the VAX version of macsyma, where there is
a facility for eseentially calling a fortran program directly from
macsyma, and having the fortran program fill in a (fortran) array.
On return from the program, the macsyma system has an official,
legal "matrix".  The IMSL library is accessible (in its original
fortran) this way.
  Nevertheless, I think you'd be wasting your time unless you really
have something more substantial than graphics in mind.

Yes, I wrote a readmacro for floating-point arrays, to save time in loading.
Also, there are two local users of Macsyma and of Fortran on LLL's CRAY-1
who have written ad-hoc lisp printers in Fortran to produce LOADFILE'able
files as you suggested in an earlier note. They found that it was
easier to produce this simple format than it was to produce a BATCH'able
format.

I would be willing to explain lisp data syntax to anybody.

Someone (it may have been GJC, or GJC may remember who it was) wrote a 
scheme on MC for someone to do a very similar thing to what you are 
talking about.  It was to fill lisp arrays with data taken from 
Fortran where a pre-determined format was used.  MACSYMA then accessed 
the lisp arrays.  So this is certainly a possible thing to do.  
Of course, we would need a Multics person to get involved in this to 
set it up, since we are all strapped for time and have no Multics person 
on our staff ever since Jim O'Dell left.  So possible is one thing, but 
expected is something else.  I would not expect it to happen, just like 
there have been no new Multics Macsyma releases for some time now.

IMSL would be available on Multics through a different mechanism than
the one we use on MC. Another way of saying this: Any routine which
can be called from PL/1 on Multics (i.e. any program on the system)
can be called from maclisp, and therefore be callable from Macsyma.
However, it takes a little bit of work to write the lisp interface for
each IMSL routine one would want. The thing to do is to name the
routines wanted in order of utility.

-gjc

p.s. The FORTRAN->Macsyma translator is actually a Fortran->Lisp translator,
and could be run on Multics, although it is better to use the standard
multics fortran compiler.

 Re: passing Multics data files to Macsyma.
What i am trying to find out is the following:
if the data file was created as an output from a Fortran or PL/I
program or
data file was created by using one of the editors
or
data were transferred to Multics from somewhere else
then can i pass the values to Macsyma and let it assign to a variable or
an array.
For example   i have data in the folowing form
1 2
2 3
...
5 6
and so on.
How can i pass it and let the first column to be assigned to variable
X and second row to be assigned to Y.
Something like X:[1,2,3....]
Y:[1,2,3,...]
Then i would be able to plot the graph or do other things.
If it's possible it would give teriffic opportunity for many users
to use their already created data and instead of writting Fortran or
PL/I programs use Macsyma.
It just crossed my mind that maybe it is possible to set the data as
a procedure and later use BATCH to load it in.
SAVE saves all the data in the LISP format , but the ordinary user
doesn't know LISP and can't even read this data, and of course can't edit
it.
(I don't know if i explained it clearly. Writting in English is a problem for
me. If it still not clear what i am trying to do i'll be happy to explain
all over the phone).
Thank a lot for your help.

This is essentially what a MACSYMA SAVE file is.  E.g. type

   I have noticed that MACSYMA misinterpreted a function I defined when I 
   referred to it later. MACSYMA functionally understood what I meant, but 
   the unevaluated form was confusing. Specifically, in the following 
   expressions, the pending integration of the sum should be indicated.
   Also, why is the integral of the secant in that squirrely, imaginary form?
   Defined expressions and MACSYMA interpretation thereof (respectively):
   phi(b,i,x):=tan(b)*(1-e^2)*integrate(a(i,x),x)
   and  a(i,x):=(sum(g(n,x),n,1,i)+1)/cos(x)   and interp.:

on Multics that may not work.  Also, two question marks to completely
remove a line is handy, no matter where you are, especially if you are
using a printing terminal.

Sorry about the mail concerning the BUG bug. It was my mistake-I put two question marks in the message accidently. By the way, why does MACSYMA have such a nasty scheme for line input. i.e. those rubout characters. Why not a delete key?

I have noticed that MACSYMA misinterpreted a function I defined when I referred to it later. MACSYMA functionally understood what I meant, but the unevaluated form was confusing. Specifically, in the following expressions, the pending integration of the sum should be indicated. Also, why is the integral of the secant in that squirrely, imaginary form? Defined expressions and MACSYMA interpretation thereof (respectively):

	 phi(b,i,x):=tan(b)*(1-e^2)*integrate(a(i,x),x)


and

	      a(i,x):=(sum(g(n,x),n,1,i)+1)/cos(x)


and interp.:

tan(b)*(1-e^2)*(log(sin(x)+1)/2-log(sin(x)-1)/2+(log(sin(x)+1)/2-log#

(sin(x)-1)/2)*'sum(g(n,x),n,1,i))

    I saved a macsyma session with SAVE([hold,0,dsk,laparker],all). How do
    I load that file into a new macsyma?
----------------------------------
The SAVE command should have printed out a line which included the file
specification of the file it wrote.  "[hold,0,dsk,laparker]" is a PDP-10
style file specification, and I am not sure what the SAVE command would have
done with it on Multics, but it should have printed out the name it gave
the file (probably something like ">udd>LAParker>[hold,0,dsk,laparker]"
but that is just a guess).  List your Multics directory... just typing

list

at Multics command level will do that, and see if any file such as
"[hold,0,dsk,laparker]" exists there.  In any case, to reload a file
saved with SAVE, you use

loadfile(">udd>LAPARKER>filename");

The quotation marks are part of the command.  Note: "filename" is the
name you gave the file in the SAVE command (or in this case, what ever
the SAVE command managed to make out of the name you gave).  In this
case "[hold,0,dsk,laparker]" is not really an acceptable Multics file
name, so I suggest you refer to your Multics literature for
information on Multics file names (or pathnames as they are called
there) so that in the future you can SAVE things more effectively.
For instance, you should use something like:

save([">udd>LAParker>hold.april12"],all);

(note the use of square brackets and quotation marks), and you would
reload such a file with

loadfile(">udd>LAParker>hold.april12");

The manual unfortunately was written with only the PDP-10 version of MACSYMA
in mind, so often PDP-10 file specifications are given.  The more general
term  "file-specification" , meaning machine-specific pathname, would be
better (a revised version of the manual will be appearing in a few months).

--------------------------------------------------
at Multics command level (i.e. after a message starting with an "r ...")
not in MACSYMA (type two breaks if you are in MACSYMA to get back to command
level), you type

delete >user_dir_dir>Edunet37>Doberkat>myfile

and it will be gone.  Or, you can do it from MACSYMA by doing

delfile(">user_dir_dir>Edunet37>Doberkat>myfile");

The double quotes around the pathname (or file-specification) are part of
the command.  File-specification on page 176 of the manual refers to the
pathname or file name string on whichever machine you are using, thus on
Multics it means the pathname of the file you wish to delete, and it is
enclosed in quotation marks.

   A new user here in France has a need for the Poisson facilities that 
   should exist in Macsyma according to the manual. Well they seem not
   to be there. Is this an oversight or do we do something wrong?
The Poisson stuff was not installed in Multics Macsyma at the time the 
tape was sent out.  See the end of this note for what can be done for you
about this.

   We have read also about extremely interesting work on
   hypergeometric functions (for example by Lafferty). This would
   be extremely useful as well. Is there any way that we can
   gain access to it?
Again, see the end of this note.

   I get the feeling that most of the developments are made around ITS
   and that somehow the transfer to Multics is not all that easy. I
   understand very well how that can be the case for everything
   written in Lisp, but surely there must be packages written in
   the Macsyma language itself that should be easy to transfer.
   Am I wrong ?
From a technical point of view, transferring both MACSYMA and LISP stuff 
from MIT-MC to Multics should be straightforward.  The main reason there 
is a hassle about the LISP stuff is that JIM (O'Dell.SoftArts@Mit-Multics)
was heading the Multics Macsyma effort and he stopped working for us in 
Sept. 1981.  So, the creation of a new Multics Macsyma since some time in 
1981 has not been done, Multics Macsyma has not kept up with developments 
at MIT-MC, and a cleanup of the Multics Macsyma environment to make 
transfer, compilation, and installation of files from MIT-MC has not been 
done.  We simply do not have Multics Macsyma experts with available time 
to work on this.  Both the Poisson and Hypergeometric source files are 
available on MIT-MC.  If you are capable of compiling these files at INRIA, 
we can FTP them to you on Multics and you will win.  Let us know if this is 
feasible for you.  If not, we'll see if something else can be worked out, 
but there may be some delay.

   expression swell and which won't require any Multics expertise to fix.
   If he is really just doing "simple" things and running out of space,
   then it probably is a Multics bug and you should get in touch with me.
   
   You will probably have to ask him or Roger Roach to give you read access
   to his files.  You can ask him to type the command:
   
       sa ** r *.Mathlab
   
   to give every file in his directory read access to the Mathlab group.
   Thanks.

I doubt it can be integrated in closed form. It looks like an

   integrate((a^2-x^2)^1/2,x,0,a) gave the wrong result, a^3/3, instead of 
   pi a^2/4.
A^3/3 is correct.  Remember that (A^2-X^2)^1/2; is (A^2-X^2)/2 .

   also, integrate((a^2-x^2)^(1/2),x,0,a) gave the wrong answer 
   -%i log(%i) a^2/2.
This answer is correct as you can see by doing RECTFORM of it.
Of course, %PI*A^2/4 is a much nicer form for the answer, and is indeed 
what you get on MIT-MC.  So, this will be fixed in Multics Macsyma if a 
new version of it with up-to-date sources is ever created.

   The name of the segment with the tildes in it instead of hatsign is

Actually tildes are correct in this file.  They mean vector-cross-product.
The reason MACSYMA was not happy with them is that one must first do 
BATCH(">lib>macsyma>share>vect.macsyma");.  It is possible to set this 
up so that this happens automatically, but alas, the vect.macsyma file 
does not work on Multics anyway so I have not done this yet.  We'll

Subject:  quit() versus CTRL/z
To: Chernin.ARCS at MIT-MULTICS
cc: MULTICS-MACSYMA-BUGS at MIT-MC

quit() kills the macsyma, CTRL/z is equivalent to typing two breaks in
succession, and returns you to the monitor so you can send mail or
something and then resume your macsyma computation (i.e. it does not
destroy the macsyma).  At least this is my understanding.  If CTRL/z
does not in fact behave this way, please let us know.  One reason we
have things working this way is that on MC Control-Z is the top level
interrupt which returns you to the monitor, from where you may resume
the computation so for "historical reasons" this is what many macsyma
users expect.

      I have now successfully transfered my file with the ratsimp problem

      named prblm batch.
You sometimes need to use FULLRATSIMP rather than RATSIMP, e.g. your 
case.  Here is the explanation: (From MC:MACDOC;UPDATE > :)
   JPG@MIT-MC 05/06/80 0511-EDT  To: INFO-MACSYM
   When non-rational expressions are involved, one call to RATSIMP 
   followed as is usual by non-rational ("general") simplification may not 
   be sufficient to return a simplified result.  Sometimes, more than one 
   such call may be necessary.  There is a new command FULLRATSIMP which 
   makes this process convenient.  FULLRATSIMP repeatedly applies RATSIMP 
   followed by non-rational simplification to an expression until no 
   further change occurs.  For example, consider 
   	EXP:	    (X^(A/2)+1)^2*(X^(A/2)-1)^2/(X^A-1) .
   RATSIMP(EXP); gives (X^(2*A)-2*X^A+1)/(X^A-1) .
   FULLRATSIMP(EXP); gives   X^A-1 .  The problem may be seen by looking at 
   RAT(EXP); which gives  ((X^(A/2))^4-2*(X^(A/2))^2+1)/(X^A-1) .
   FULLRATSIMP(exp,var1,...,varn) takes one or more arguments similar 
   to RATSIMP and RAT as described in the MACSYMA manual for RAT.

Following your advice I have been using emacs to create a batch file on a

to store the output.  Today I ran into trouble doing this when
my batch job had an error in it

error in batch file
6)used break z to get out of macsyma & fixed batch file7)set_tty -modes ll132
8)pi to getr back into macsyma
9)writefile();
10)batch starting where it left off the last time
11)closefile       after the batch error i closed the batch file
12) exited from macsyma and dprinted both writefiles
I observe that the first writefile was perfect, while the display
in the second match file was confused.  Stuff appeared all over the
pge.  Its as if the line length were wrong or some parameter(importrant)
controlling the display was changed by having entered emacs

   if you execute file problem.batch you will see that at line starts&& 
   the expression is not reported to be zero.  If you multiply out the 
   multiplicand by hand, however, you will notice that it is zero
   exactly.  I thought ratsimp should have yielded zero.
If you FTP the relevant material (expression, file(s), whatever it takes 
to see the problem) to your MC directory, I'll take a look at the 
RATSIMP problem.  It will be easier for me to check out on MC.  Of course, 
after I look at it, I will delete the MC file(s) if necessary, if they are 
large, unless you tell me not to.

SAVE(ALL) may be more expensive than recalculation since I/O is
expensive and common-subexpressions-sharing will be lost.
It is best to only save what you know you want, FUNCTIONS, VALUES, ARRAYS.
Or better yet, specific items from the above. Saving C and D lines
is not useful because loading them back in will clobber things in
the new macsyma invocation. Another indication is that novice users
commonly generate expressions many times larger than they need to
solve a given problem. It is best to early on become familiar with
the computation characteristics of small problems in macsyma,
especially as subproblems of larger problems, otherwise there is
great chance for waste.

Subject:  To make a bound_lisp_intrprtr_
To:       Kelley, Gook.FluidPla, Multics-Macsyma-Bugs at Mit-MC

Peter, the procedure for making a bound_lisp_intrprtr_ is a little
more complicated than I thought at first. What to do?

1) get an empty directory.
2) copy BOTH bound_lisp_intrprtr_.1.archive and
   bound_lisp_intrprtr_.2.archive into it.
3) ac x bound_lisp_intrprtr_.1 
   ac x bound_lisp_intrprtr_.2 to get all the segs out of the
   directories. The reason that there are two archives is that one
   contains alm and one conatins PL/I sources.
4) ac a bound_lisp_intrprtr_ [segs *]
5) ac a bound_lisp_intrprtr_ bound_lisp_intrprtr_.bind
6) bind bound_lisp_intrprtr_

This assumes that you have compiled the lisp_segment_manager_ and
installed it in the right archive along with the other PL/I sources.

Installing NEW lisp callable routines is a little more complicated and I
will detail this process. It involves making an addition to the
lisp_subr_tv_ enrty in a non-trivial manner, which slips my mind right
now but I am sure I could dig it up in an hour or so of work.

Making the compiler is a somewhat easier process as I remember since it
is written in lisp and has none of the complicated linkage issues
associated with it.

I did this and managed to get a working lisp out of the process and it
took about 15 minutes. Lamson also has a lisp_segment_manager_.mcr in
his lisp dir.

Let me know how you make out.

    the line

    	  loadfile(">lib>macsyma>share>optvar.macsyma")
    .....
------------------------
Our messages must have crossed in the mail due to some delays, but
as I indicated in my message of 9/29 early morning, correct command
for optvar here is:

batch(">lib>macsyma>share>optvar.macsyma");

The error message you were getting, by the way, is an indication that
the file which the system is attempting to load in is NOT a Lisp or
Fasl format file.  The scheme for naming MACSYMA Share files on
Multics is as follows:

xxxx.macsyma    ->  a batchable (i.e. MACSYMA readable) file, use batch
xxxx.lisp       ->  a lisp file, use loadfile
xxxx.fasl       ->  a compiled lisp file, use loadfile
xxxx.usage      ->  a text file, to be printed
xxxx.demo       ->  a demo file, MACSYMA readable, use demo or batch

In the future the "load" scheme will be working on Multics, and it will
be possible to just use the load command and the system will figure out
whether "loadfile" or "batch" is appropriate, in fact it will also figure
out which directory the file is on, so load(optvar);  would do the
appropriate thing, without your having to worry about it.

To run OPTVAR on Multics you must do:

batch(">lib>macsyma>share>ode2.macsyma");
batch(">lib>macsyma>share>desoln.macsyma");
batch(">lib>macsyma>share>optvar.macsyma");

and then

at which point you should be in business.

does not workI wanted to get the demo for optvar so i typed

	    demo(">lib>macsyma>share>optvar.macsyma")


macsyma typed a cline which seems wrong,

		         ttyoff:true


followed by a hyphen. first i entered carriage return, and the result was another hyphen. then i entered space CR, and the return was another hyphen. typing anything else threw macsyma into limbo. would you type out for me the correct way to use demo to get the demo for optvar. thanks

   I got only two questions. -4ab-4a**2 positive or negative?
   answer:negative, and the second question: ab+a**2 positive or zero?
   answer:positive.  i am not sure from previous answer from you that
   you were doing the same problem. the answer should be
   2*%pi*abs(a+b/2)/(a**2+a*b)**(3/2)
MC agrees with all of this.  ROMBERG agrees with his answer when a=1
and b=1.  (I didn't check other values.)  The reason two very similar
questions are asked (the first obviously makes the second unnecessary)
is due to a bug in COMPAR which I've yet to track down.  (It is
supposed to ask the question about an expression in FACTORed form,
which should enable it to retain the correct information.  E.g.
(ASKSIGN(-4*A*B-4*A^2),ASKSIGN(A*B+A^2)); does this correctly.)

I tracked this down a little. It seems to be due to the fact that
indefinite integration LEARN's that the expression is NOT EQUAL
to zero. The defint bug has to do with the fact that we get
ATAN's in the answer. You can naievely substitute in the limits
into the indefinite integral and get zero just as DEFINITE
integration did.

What is the <space> for?  I believe as ELLEN has already answered,

Let me correct myself:  The example command is also in the 1977 manual:
EXAMPLE is on page 174, DEMO on page 176.  However, the example command
is not implemented on Multics yet.

demo is working, and as I said before, the "_" is a prompt which is
waiting for you to indicate that you are ready to view the next line
of the demonstration.  You indicate this by typing <carriage return>
when the prompt appears.  To terminate the demonstration, if you do
not want to see it through to the end, use Control-G.

The example command probably is not in the 1977 manual.  "demo" is
however, on page 176 and several other places.  Basically what either
command is waiting for after the 
_

at the beginning of the line is a "space" typed by you to indicate that you

                             1/(b*cos(x)^2+a)^2


      from 0 2%pi, given ab+a**2 positive.  it's convergent. nonzero.


    I will look at this more carefully and let you know the
    resolution.

I got MANY more questions than you suggest above. Just the same if I answer
positive to ALL the questions I get zero. I am pretty sure this means that
I am answering some of the questions inconsistently. If I assume a>0 and b>0
and answer the questions accordingly I get as non-zero answer. Furthermore
if I do the integral integrate(1/(cos(x)^2+1,x,0,2*%pi) and then restrict
my more general answer to this case I get, after some simple algebra exactly
the same answer. Why don't you try this and let me know how you make out.

Some day a TRANSLated and compiled version of ODE2 should be used on 
Multics as it now is on MC.  This is much more of a win for Multics than 
it is for MC.  Of course, you'll have to make sure you have at least the 
latest TRANSL runtime supports on Multics, in this case TRANSL;ACALL.

	We have encountered a difficulty with outputting fortran formulae
	onto a file.

	For the moment we manage using general purpose multics facilities
	(audit, or file_output) but both methods are clumsy and involve
	editing out garbage in a text file. Do you have any better suggestion for us?

What kinds of problems are you having with file_output?  Remember that
you can type directly to Macsyma:

    cline("file_output f");
    generate_macsyma_output();
    cline("revert_output");

This will cause the output produced by generate_macsyma_output to go to
the file f.  You can even do this on a single command line by using the
parenthesis construct, i.e.

    (cline(...), generate_macsyma_output(), cline(...));

    We have encountered a difficulty with outputting fortran formulae
    onto a file.

    1.stringout complains about a function "?cnamef" not being defined at Lisp
    level.

    2.writefile() allows to keep a script of a macsyma session but the
    output of a command fortran(di) does not register in this script. But
    what we waanted in the file was precisely that expression in fortran style.

    For the moment we manage using general purpose multics facilities
    (audit, or file_output) but both methods are clumsy and involve
    editing out garbage in a text file. Do you have any better suggestion for us?

In a recent Macsyma run, in which I was trying to solve a linear system
of 4 equations in 4 unknowns, the coefficients of which were first
partial derivatives of ratios of two polynomials, Macsyma would do the
calculation (i.e., it printed the time required) but stopped during the
display of the result.  The process terminated and a new one began, but
of course the result of the calculation was lost.  Please comment on what
might have caused this and how to correct it.  I believe that the
segment, udd>Microbit>Singhal>Height.execute has rw access to
the SysDaemons, as do the segments ...>Height.macsyma  and ...>Solution.
macsyma which the first one loads.  Therefore, you are welcome to try
it yourself if you like.
-----
I am not a SysDaemon and therefore would need different access. Why not
set r access to *.*.*? Usually problems like this occurr when your process
directory runs out of disk quota. Most Macsyma users like to have a quota of
2048 on their p_dirs. The default is 1024. If you have not had yours increased
to 2048 contact Roach.SysMaint at Multics and ask for the increased quota.

   Also, could you provide me with instructions on how to access the
UPDATE file for Macsyma on MC through Multics?

   Can macsyma integrate any function a human can?
No.  Your own example is proof of this.

   Differentiating h(x)*g(x) with respect to x and then integrating 
   the result produces the noun form.
Generally speaking, MACSYMA only handles integrals which are integrable 
in terms of the "elementary functions" (rational functions, trigonometrics, 
logs, exponentials, radicals, etc.) and a few extensions (error function, 
dilogarithm).  It does not handle integrals in terms of unknown functions 
such as g(x) and h(x).  (Many years ago MACSYMA had a general integration 
by parts routine and could handle your problem, but that routine was 
flushed when the Risch algorithm was implemented.)

When you do  tellsimp(sin(x)^2,1-cos(x)^2); you get back e.g. 
[^rule1,simpexpt].  "^rule1" is the rulename.  (simpexpt is the name 
of the built-in simplifier for "^".)  So, e.g.

   This works on MIT-MC Macsyma, so I'll look into this as a
   site-dependant bug.
The bug may already be fixed in the source file on MC , RAT;HOMOG > .
The bug would have been avoided if the flag HOMOG_HACK had its correct 
setting on Multics of FALSE.  I sent mail to MULTICS-MACSYMA-BUGS on 
5/29/81 about this, but apparently nothing was done about it.

    REALROOTS provides roots of x**6 + 5*x**3 + 7*x =1,
    but ALLROOTS can't find any.  Why?

Many people have asked this question. The algorithms used in each
function are very different. For one thing the ALLROOTS algorithm is 
sensitive to the numerical-roundoff-error of floating-point arithmetic,
which can allow strange things to happen. A detailed explanation
is beyond the scope of this note, but there is in preparation
some "Notes on Macsyma and Numerical Applications."

In a recent Macsyma run, in which I was trying to solve a linear system
of 4 equations in 4 unknowns, the coefficients of which were first
partial derivatives of ratios of two polynomials, Macsyma would do the
calculation (i.e., it printed the time required) but stopped during the
display of the result.  The process terminated and a new one began, but
of course the result of the calculation was lost.  Please comment on what
might have caused this and how to correct it.  I believe that the
segment, udd>Microbit>Singhal>Height.execute has rw access to
the SysDaemons, as do the segments ...>Height.macsyma  and ...>Solution.
macsyma which the first one loads.  Therefore, you are welcome to try
it yourself if you like.
   Also, could you provide me with instructions on how to access the
UPDATE file for Macsyma on MC through Multics?

            >udd>Mathlab>Macsyma>documentation
        rather than
            >libraries>Macsyma>documentation

        I have created such a path in the Multics hierarchy at INRIA and
        from there linked to the actual documentation files .

        Obviously binding has occured at compile time, which is rather unfortunate.

        Other Multics sites will have the same problem so now
        you know the solution. Oh well, just traditional systems programming and
        debugging....

Our apologies for this problem.  Wherever possible, we have tried to
avoid using >exl software.  I believe this call to mode_string_ is from
the lisp interpreter, which is one piece of >exl software which we must
use.  On MIT-Multics, mode_string_ is now an installed module, and it
should be part of the next Multics release.

Typing "gls mode_string_.pl1" on the MIT system will extract a copy of
the source from the apropriate online library.  "where mode_string_"
will locate the object segment.

Well, if the expression is an EXPANDed polynomial POLY in X and Y, then 
the following should work (It returns a transformed POLY, I'm not sure if
that is what you wanted):

COLLECT_TERMS(POLY,X,Y):=

I would really appreciate it if you could pinpoint areas of the instruction 
sheet that are misleading and let me know. I have a copy on line at Multics 
that I could leave for you to edit if you would be so kind.

        2. As we are in August, most of our potential users are away on holidays.
        I am not an expert so I tried simply to run the demos. The demo pfacto.demo
        fails on its last example with "trying to take car or cdr of number" but
        on the whole almost everything else went fine.

I suspect that this is also a bug on MC bug will check it out and let you know.

        3. I attempted to use PLOT3D. I demands 9 parameters but the documentation
        doesn't explain that many. Did I do something wrong or is the documentation
        slightly out-of-dat?

The PLOT3D routine on Multics Calls the Multics Graphics Routines nd is not at
all the same as the one on MC. I believe the parameters are
f(x,y),x,ll,ul,y,ll,ul,theta,phi but it is OLD and has not been redone yet
for the new Multics macsyma. Remember to do a setup_graphics before you
try it.

        4. I suspect tha macsyma is very memory-hungry. Should I recommend to macsyma
        users to extend their process directory quota?

Serious Macsyma users on MC use a quota of 2000 on their pdir. In addition
for really LARGE users we have a directory of 10,000 quota that can be used
in conjunction with the lis$set_lisp_temp_dir command to give more storage
to the lisp without requiring obnoxiously large pdir's

        5. I have this mailbox at MIT-Multics (GKahn.INRIA @ MIT-Multics). Is it
        a reasonable means of communication between the Mathlab group and INRIA.
I think that your Multics mailbox would be a VERY good way to communicate.
You can also check out bugs with the latest version on the MIT MACHINE and
we can work very conveniently that way. For the time being if you send
mail on Multics to multics-macsyma-bugs -at mit-mc you should reach me.

        Would you prefer some other way? I shall pass on also remarks from
        the Grenoble site, if and when they have any.
It would be good if they could obtain a MIT Multics account. I believe that
if they contact Honeywell they will be obliged. If not let me know and I will
see if I can contact our Honeywell rep. here. (There maybe problems because
you are not in the states, I don't know about that.)

        6. Please tell Prof. Moses and members of the Mathlab group how
        happy people are here with the possibility of using Macsyma. After a
        time of adaptation, people here might eventually be able to produce
        utilities of general interest and pass them on to you...

I think that would be very interesting. As you know we have sent you the
macsyma code to read but we are not prepared, at this time, to send you
the complete lisp compilation environment although I'm sure we could
arrange to if needed. Of course if you write in standard Multics Lisp
you will ceratinly be able to load it into a Macsyma. In future release
we may be able to provide the Macsyma-to-lisp translator also.

Good Luck!! and many thanks for your patience.

    There was a call for Jim from a Mr. Kahn at Indria in France.  He said he 
    had received the macsyma tapes and was setting them up.  The two tape names
     are Libraries Macsyma and Experimental Lipsdir.  He wanted to know if it 
    was possible to use another name instead of the latter as the pplace was 
    already occupied.  What should he do?  I have his phone number but
    we agreed
    that there was no point in anyone calling him back because of the time 
    difference.  So he will be sending a message via ARPAnet.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Since JIM's schedule is uncertain at the moment, could someone else answer
this and send the information to me and/or Rosie so that we can communicate
appropriately with the person (or else get the number from Rosie and
communicate directly with him)?

AFB needs to use them within the next week or so.

BEGIN DEMO on Multics still uses E labels in its SOLVE example, which

Also, the Primer does not seem to be installed, I was under the impression

Are you using telenet or tymnet to connect to Multics. I suspect that this

again? If the problem happens again make a macsyma SAVE file containing the
offending expression, set the access to r for everyone and I'll take a look

Depending on your expression, which you did not forward, 
RATCOEF(expr,variable,0);  often does the trick (eg. when expression

You can, if you wish, call this a linsolve problem of 4 equations. But I call 
it a horrible mess and I am not surprised you cannot solve it. You have
dozens(?) of other parameters floating about and the program cannot deal with
them. My advice is to clump all the garbage together with one symbolic name,
solve the problem and then substitute back. Surely, that is the way you
would approach it if you had to do it by hand, wouldn't you?

    If i use writefile, which is what you have suggested, the expressions are written out in easy to read form

Do you know about the SAVE command in Macsyma? That and using BATCH files
are the ways to macsyma readable files.

    You don't need the manuals to use multics, since most documentation is also

But not always in a logical sequence or rapidly accessible.  I strongly
recommend reading the Introductory Users' Guide to Multics before using
the system.  It is available from the IPS publications office or by
sending Multics mail to PUBS.

    list_help access

No.  "lisp_help acl" is what you really want for general information
about access control.  "list_help access" will give you totally
unrelated information.

    list_help mail

No.  "help mail_system" is what you really want for general information
about the mail system.

    secondly: the fortran flag should determine whether the file is written

    The problem is that when I typed fortran; the system responded with 
    fortran, instead of true or false.

Unfortunately, the FORTRAN switch was flushed from MACSYMA many years ago.
Somehow the description of STRINGOUT in the manual was not so updated.
The FORTRAN command does exist.  About the best one can do here (as far 
as I know) is to do a WRITEFILE, a bunch of calls to the FORTRAN command, 
and a CLOSEFILE.  Some day, a FORTRANOUT command similar to STRINGOUT 
will be written.

I do not know how many macsymas you need to run at the same time, but
running 1 or 2 on a VAX with enough memory is no particular problem;
running 4 is ok if you have maybe 4 megabytes of main memory and not
too many large cpu-intensive jobs.  I agree with JIM that you should
not just "ask for a copy of macsyma just to try it out".  On the other
hand, if you are a US gov't agency or contractor, you are, I believe,
entitled to a royalty free copy.

Use the MAIL command to ask a question.
I'll forward your request for Vax Macsyma information to CSAVX.fateman for
you and he can make the initial reply. The general idea is that you pay 
something between $5000 adn $10000 and you get a copy including some consulting
help. Beware that VAX Macsyma tends to use up a very large fraction of the
machine and that one running with 4 macsyma users is not too much good for
anything else. In short I'd suggest that you become familiar with the Macsyma
system and how to use it BEFORE purchasing one for your own machine.

This indicates that you tried to execute a problem for which you had inadequate

a quota of 2048 records for your process_dir.

How many more people are we going to have to screw before we get around to

Multics Macsyma users should be told to send mail to Macsyma.Bugs, just as
they send mail to Emacs.Bugs, etc.  Rather than making the various
implementations conform to the losing models of Macsyma, we should make
Macsyma conform to the winning models of the host operating systems.

A decent redefinition for the BUG command would be for it to take no
arguments and simply do (cline "send_mail Macsyma.Bugs -no_subject").
This would allow such conveniences as punctuation and mixed case in
messages, editing of mail, etc.

    GCOOK@MIT-MC 06/08/81 18:23:15
    I am currently trying to get a very complicated Macsyma program to
    run on MULTICS.  Several MACLISP functions have been added to the 
    environment, one of which complicates matters by doing extra file output
    that is not supported by basic MACSYMA commands.  To make matters worse
    the computation will require many hours of CPU time.  Thus, any help
    you can give with regard to the following questions would be most
    appreciated.
    
The preceding paragraph is not clear to me.  I can't see how adding
procedures to the Lisp environment would complicate the Macsyma environment.

    Because of the need to checkpoint this program, the attaching, opening
    and closing of the required output files pose some difficult problems if
    they are to accomplished at MULTICS command level (in an EXEC_COM segment
    for example).  Essentially, this would require the file information to be
    available at command level.  Is MACSYMA a completely closed subsystem on
    MULTICS, or can this information be communicated to command level?
    If it can be made available, how?
    
You probably want to use the CLINE command in Macsyma, which will pass a
command line to the Multics command processor.  CLINE("file_output x");
will direct file output to the file x.  Alternately, you can use the
WRITEFILE command in Macsyma, but Macsyma/MacLisp I/O tends to be
unreliable, slow, and difficult to use.
    
    I tried thinking about handling the problem at MACSYMA level, but it doesn't
    appear possible to restart a MACSYMA computation after an alarm set up by
    the ALARMCLOCK function has gone off.  And in view of this, it doesn't
    appear straightforward to resubmit a suspended MACSYMA computation to an
    ABSENTEE queue from MACSYMA level (via the CLINE function).  Is this
    correct?
    
You seem to be way out in left field.  Why don't you contact somebody in
person for assistance.

    Finally, how does one save the current state of a job after it has run out
    of time;i.e., how does one dump out the job state?  And then, how does one
    restart such a job from command level?  These are probably simple questions,
    but I am a new MULTICS user, so please bear with me.
    
You use the "save" fsubr in Lisp, but you shouldn't be using it.  There
are better ways to do what you want to do.

    What invocation should I make to run a LARGE macsyma on
    Multics? That is, one which will not get a quota overflow
    as the default does.

Use the set_lisp_temp_dir command.  That tells lisp what directory to use
for constructing the environment.  By default the process directory (with
2048 records of quota) is used.  I believe there is a directory
>udd>Mathlab>lisp_temp_dir with an 8000 record quota, so

    set_lisp_temp_dir >udd>Mathlab>lisp_temp_dir

will do the trick.  I believe this is mentioned in old mail to this list.

For those of you who hack quota, the limit on this dir is 8000 (or whatever)
rather than being open and falling back to the limit on >udd>Mathlab to stop
bugs involving infinite consing before they use up all the storage we've
got.  Be careful when moving this around.

GCOOK needs a user-level callable SUSPEND function,
working semantically just like the one on ITS.
SUSPEND("foobar"); closes all connections with the outside
world, then dumps itself to create the command "foobar"
upon resumption all the connections are sent a re-initialization
message. You can even be in the middle of a BATCH or WRITEFILE,
and things will work. Needless to say, it isn't quite right
because the DISPLA package switches and other terminal-depended
things presently don't get re-initialized properly, because
the information needed is in ALJABR;LOADER >, and somewhat
inacessable.

What you can come up with?

    Well, what I'd prefer is for compilers to have a hook into

    make sure the user sees only the important stuff. 
    
    The classes of syntactical and semantic errors that come up are
    very well defined, however, in existing compilers (this includes
    my code in the macsyma->lisp translator) there is a patchwork of
    style-warnings of all kinds. [Exception: RLB;H]
    There is a confusion as to when to
    warn, before or after macroexpansion. Some things that are ok in
    a VALUE context, e.g. (MEMQ X '(FOOBAR)) are "funny" in a predicate
    context, (IF (MEMQ X '(FOOBAR)) ...) ==> (IF (OR (EQ X 'FOOBAR)) ...)
    ==> warning about only one clause in an "OR"
    When (MEMQ X '(FOOBAR)) is generated with a conventional macro then
    there is either a loss in transparency or a loss in potential
    compiler conversationality. We all have experienced the fact that
    conventional macrology bites the bag in a number of ways.

It's not obvious what you're talking about in your claim.  Your own
example refutes the claim if you read it the way I do.  The contextual
information you need to decide to decide whether to warn about

(OR (EQ X 'FOOBAR))

is whether the form was in the original sexp read from the file.
Classic optimizers don't care where the form came from.  But I'm
probably misreading your claim.

In fact, if JONL's coding style is to be supported,

(OR (FOO) #+NIL (BAR))

is important.  I might even do that sometimes; I pick on JONL because I
happen to know of several places he has written just that.  Probably a
better way to write this, in this case, would be

(OR (FOO)
    (IF (FEATUREP 'NIL)
	(BAR)))

where the compiler knows FEATUREP of a constant known feature in the
target feature set can be compiled away.  If you don't know about
FEATUREP and feature sets, see LSPSRC;SHARPA >.

In short, George, this is a valid issue, but much harder to add to
existing compilers that you imply.  I don't know if you are suggesting
that people spend time to add it to existing compilers, or are just
wishing, but I wouldn't ever expect to see support for this in the
MacLisp compilers, at least.

The message is "IGNORE bound but not ignored", and it only happens
for the variable IGNORE.  It is there to tell you that although you
called your variable IGNORE, you actually used it.  Now it is a bug
that the warning is cute rather than helpful (prepending "The variable "
to the message would give the user a prayer of understanding it) the
message is correct, except that it doesn't note where the variable is
used for effect rather than for value, and so being ignored for that
reason, after all.

LISPM people:  How about fixing the error message so everybody can
stop answering this same complaint?

Macsyma people:  You can suppress warning messages everywhere by
putting the variables you want ignored at top level in the defun
after the variable list.  This may not always have worked, but it
does now at least on the -10 and LISPM.  I think it works on Multics
too, no?

I agree.  Having an error message printed and ignored for every compilation

allows me to watch the compiler errors for real problems.

    As a side note, the following code compiled on the lispm :

I think the convention F(X,Y):=(X,Y^2); evaluating a variable for
side-effect in order to prevent the "Warning: Unused lambda variable"
message sucks.  Obviously the compiler could easily say "Comment:
Variable X evaluated for effect," and then it could still generate an
unused-lambda-variable warning.  ?IGNORE_FOOBAR isn't bad, because the
real point is to keep a printed message from the compiler from
gaining undue attention. Even if the compiler's message printer
didn't filter these out, a simple text-editing macro could.
I could perhaps introduce F(X,Y):=(MODE_DECLARE(X,IGNORED),Y^2);
and have it interface to whatever was idiosyncratic for the
target system, however, I don't know at translate time (rather,
I don't want to know) what the target system is, I only know
it at macro-expand time, so it's complex.
What I would suggest is for ASB to use Ignore_Foobar or ?Ignore_Foobar,
and then to actually *IGNORE* (hot damn!) the messages about
ignored variables. I mean, ignorance is in the eye of the beyholder
you know.

As a side note, the following code compiled on the lispm :

(defun foo (ignored_variable) 
       ignored_variable ; ignored
       (bar))

causes a message along the lines of

"Warning: IGNORED_VARIABLE ignored but not ignored."

How about that.

    You once told me that the convention for ignored arguments in a function
    is to name them ?IGNORE..... .  This does not seem to be the convention
    at multics.  True?  For an example, try to compile >udd>Mathlab>Brenner>graph.lisp

Multics does not obey this convention.  If the PDP10 implementation
does, then it must have been added recently.  To ignore a function
parameter, try the following:  Name as you normally would and then
reference it in the body if the function.  Will the translator process
this correctly George?  Perhaps the translator should have its own
convention?

    After a while, nlcp seems to loop on this file (it runs for a very long time).
    The file can be found on MC as MAX1.5;AR7:GRAPH MULTIX.  The UNLISP and TRLISP
    are on max1.5;ar11:.  The MACSYMA version is max1.5;dsk:graph 12.

To see if there is an infinite loop, use "nlcp file -tm".  This will
print out the time needed to compile each function as it is compiled.
Useful for detecting other types of bugs as well.  Type "help lcp" for a
list of all the features of the lisp compiler on Multics.

You once told me that the convention for ignored arguments in a function
is to name them ?IGNORE..... .  This does not seem to be the convention
at multics.  True?  For an example, try to compile >udd>Mathlab>Brenner>graph.lisp

Also, do you remember the problems I had with the name conflict with VECTOR?
Well, they're fixed at MC, by the patches you suggested, but these patches
don't seem to be adequate at multics.  Try to compile that same file to see
this behavior.

After a while, nlcp seems to loop on this file (it runs for a very long time).
The file can be found on MC as MAX1.5;AR7:GRAPH MULTIX.  The UNLISP and TRLISP
are on max1.5;ar11:.  The MACSYMA version is max1.5;dsk:graph 12.

    the qualitative analysis routines are those on p.219 of the macsyma reference manual
    associated with the commands loadfile(stoute,>,dsk,mrg) and batch(qual,>,dsk,share) in the ITS version

They routines can be gotten on multics by doing.
loadfile(">lib>macsyma>share>stoute");
batch(">lib>macsyma>share>qual.macsyma");
IN addition there is a demo file
batch(">lib>macsyma>share>qual.demo");
and a usage file that can be printed out from macsyma by doing
cline("print >lib>macsyma>share>qual.usage");
let me know if you experience any problems.

Do you know exactly which share package you want?
There isn't really anything which is an extensive and documented addition to
the built-in capability of macsyma in the qualitiative analysis area.
For example, simply taking the TAYLOR series of a function tells
all the classical analytic information you would want to know.

    but near the end (my input c295 on the output file
    run3.absout (which I have set to sa r *.*.* so you can

    the multics let my job finisah?   How will I ever be able to do
    some algebra problems if the damned system throws me off
    when it is about 4/5 done?  Maybe you could fix the fault in

I am sure that there are many of these in the describe data base and it seems

For this case can't we just change the data base since every place uses

    What is the difference between
    prelude.incl.lisp
    and macsyma_prelude.incl.lisp

    you know, glitches like this really bother me when I start working
    on a system new to me.

"prelude.incl.lisp" is a synonym for "macsyma_prelude.incl.lisp".  Multics
segments can have multiple names.

Originally, I decided that we would say (includef "prelude") at the head of
Macsyma files.  It later occurred to me that we may have many different
prelude files in the same translator search space.  (Type "psp translator"
to view this space.)  Indeed, there is now lisp_prelude.incl.lisp for using
just the lisp extensions.  So Macsyma files should really be saying
(includef "macsyma_prelude").  The old name is around for compatibility.

The operating system is your friend, but
Macsyma is your mistress, highly valued, at times highly
unpredictable. You have to know how to treat her right.

Seriously though, dropping all higher powers of X, etc, sounds like
truncated TAYLOR's series to me. Try TAYLOR(EXP,X,0,10) and it will
get an expression with all terms higher than X^10 dropped out.  The
expression can then be added,multiplied, etc. with other TAYLOR series
and polynomials, and even DIFF'd, and you will get taylors series
back, with the proper terms kept or dropped automatically.
I have found the techniques to be useful in differential equation
hacking.

Your problem with rubout, backspace, #, etc has to do with your
lack of familiarity with the MULTICS operating you are using
and has nothing to do with "the strange twists of thinking"
of MIT people or Artificial Intelligence researchers as you
so crudely put it. The skill of "understanding the twists"
is not what you need to win, in fact, it is a dangerous thing
to depend on when manuals are so easy to read.

Along those lines, it is much easier to send extended bug
notes via the mechanisms provided in MULTICS-EMACS than it
is to use the macsyma BUG command, which was only meant
for short notes. The moral: "know your operating system, she is your friend."

    guesses as the backspace key and the delete key.

To my knowledge the only characters that should give trouble are
the " (double quote) and the ; (semi-colon).

The # symbol and the @ symbol (for character delete and line delete) are
the standard multics conventions. These characters can be changed to almost
any other keyboard character if you wish. The multics typein conventions
were set before the wide use of video terminals and were chosen so that
people on printing terminals would be able to see what they were doing.
Soon Multics will have a video system for use with video terminals that will
be much more user friendly.

to CWH at MIT-MC     I invite you to try sending
a message using the macsyma bug command and put in
some double quotes or some semicolons or almost any
other special character.  It does not work and tends to
infuriate me.   Thanks for the information about using
the number symbol to indicate backspacing to macsyma.
Since I am not skillful at understanding the strange twists of
thinking of MIT people (perhaps it is just the AI people
who have such twists) I was unable to guess
that it was the number symbol, instead I was wasting my
time and paper and the computer time trying such silly
guesses as the backspace key and the delete key.

    to JIM at MIT-MC    I have examined the output form last nights ear job.
    It is the case that macsyma did not fo what I wanted with respenct to
    the instructions in the batch file regarding  tellsimp and tellsimpafter.
    I wanted macsyma to throuw away all terms having e to a power higher than 2.
    My input lines werez
    tellsimpafter(e63,0)d
    block([simpzfalseq,tellsimp(e63,0))d
    where 6 stands for caret and z stands for colon and d stands for dollar sign
    But there are oodles of output terms printed in my prointout file with
    powers  of e greater than 2, my line c102 is subst(ssqrtmb,sqrtmb,pct)z
    whree pct is percentsighn and z is semicolon d  and
    the (d102) answer is over a thousand terms  and stuff   I mean to say that the d102
    output takes 1300 lines and starts right off with an e to the 6 power
    PLease excuse the spelling errors in this long bug message but I do not know how to
    make  the delete or back up correctly with the mulics.  When I try to do
    backspace or delete keys while typing in a multics command it never seems to understand what I want to do.

We'll need more information to track down what going on here.
Obviously the best solution is for you to produce a minimal example of 
what you are trying to do which doesn't do what you want.
Failing that please 
set tha access on you batch file so that the world can read it. When you have
done that let me know and I'll take a look.
sa file_name r *.*.*
is the appropriate incantation from multics command level.

The character delete key on Multics is # and the Line delete is @.

P.S.
save("foo",all);
is more graceful now, thanks for pointing it out.

to  JIM at MIT-MC   If you asume that I was logged into MUltics over
the ARPANET via a tTIP you are correct.   Sometimes I use TYMNET.
I have another complaint.   I ran an absentee job last night (the
operating system calls these ear) and when the MACSYMA did a
save([zfilnamz],all)q
where z stands for double quote sign and q stands for semicolon
the response was the following line
Errorz  record-quota-overflow condition by lisp-print-I4260 (line 1179)
where z stands for colon and - stands for underline and I stands for
 the vertical bar
and it then dumped my job off and did not finish it, it ran onlt
10 minutes and about one third or less of what I wanted.   How
wil I be able to save my partial resultswith such a persnikity
system?  The next line from the ysstem was
absenteez Attempt to reenter user environment via call to cu-qcl. Job terminated.
where the z stands for colon and the - stands fr underline and the q stands for dollar sign.
It then logged me out and toldme that CPU usage was 9 min 58 sec, memory usage was
1281.0 units.    Is 1281 unints a large amount of memry?

Do, tellsimpafter(e^3,0);

A new version of Macsyma has just been installed on Multics.

Changes include:

1) Compiled MTRACE.
2) Installation of metering tools.
3) Macsyma no longer must be invoked from command level 1.
4) The Macsyma function PLOT now interfaces to the Multics
   graphics system when MULTGRAPH:TRUE;
   (The user must have previously done a setup_graphics
    from command level.)

This corresponds to MC version 296.

If you could set r access to the appropriate segments in you directory

I will look into it. My first guess is that your problem will not be repeatable
and that it was caused by a hardware "Glitch". Quite often you will simply
be able to type start to the process and things will start just where they

By all means please keep me informed on the status of this problem.

    Re:   Recompiling Macsyma

        I thought we had agreed to compile_archive ([contents archive_names])
        bind_archive ([contents archive_names])

      I had tried to do this first but lost badly because evidently the
      compile_archive command did not properly extract the appropriate files 
      from the archive.

    The compile_archive command assumes that the components of the archive
    have been extracted, as is the case if they have just been copied.  I
    thought you knew how these commands worked.  The command lines to type were

        cwd >udd>Mathlab>Macsyma>source
        do "ac x &1; compile_archive &1;bind_archive &1" ([contents <tools>archive_names])

You mean
do "ac x bound_macsyma_&1.s; compile_archive &1;bind_archive &1" ([contents ,tools>archive_names]). There is no compile_macsyma command by the way.

I was going to look over the compile_archive command and the associated
ec to see if it is used anywhere else therein. I was thinking that if
appropriatly coded it can check to see if the file exists and if not
just extract it from the appropriate archive. As an adjunct to this I was
thinking find_file or extract_file would be a nice command to have. It would
locate the appropriate archive and extract a current copy of the file and
put it into your working dir. (maybe we want extract_source_file and 
extract_object_file ?). Con't these be done with the same sort of hack you pull
in update_file to locate the archive?

This would have sped up the entire operation as the arpanet file transfer
would not have been necessary.  Also, this would have left the Macsyma in
a somewhat better state since we would not have had arpanet problems to
contend with.  (Granted, the Macsyma probably would have been broken
anyway due to recent changes ...)

    If you ever feel the urge to type "update_macsyma", i.e. to re-transfer,

    to send a note to this mailing list so that others working on the source

    If you are doing this with an absentee job, please schedule the absentee
    job to go off at 3 am, not 12 noon.  More people tend to use the computer
    at 12 noon than at 3 am, so it slows things down for those  of us using it

    the entire Macsyma source, it is better to lock it at 3am rather than at
    12 noon.  It is quite frustrating to have to say this so many times.
When I started this absentee the machine was VERY empty. I'll bet that you got
in on the tail end of it.

    Jim, I thought we agreed you would do compile_macsyma then bind_macsyma,
    and save the transfer for later.  Our copy of Macsyma is now completely
    broken due to arpanet lossage.  Even so, I did put hooks into

    O.K. but, have you tried to tmr'ing a lisp and initiating a new one
    with an EMACS on the stack already, boy do you lose bad. A long
    message saying something to the effect that you'd better be sure
    that your EMACS and your Macsyma are in consistent lisps.

I'm aware of this, and it is something we should watch out for.  Macsyma
can check to see if the wrong lisp is initiated and print a message.  But if
I know what I'm doing, let me run a macsyma at level 2 !!!

We can arrange for people on the Macsyma project to always get the same
lisp.  [I've already done that.]  SIPB does this as well.  We can advise the
center to do the same for people who go to them with the expressed purpose
of using Macsyma, if not for all of their users.

    It takes longer to start up a macsyma than an emacs so I guess I don't 
    understand the reasoning above.

Starting up a minima is fast.  And if I have a customized emacs with lots of
files read in, starting over is very slow.  The emacs is *always* at the top
of the stack.

    I do AGREE that the current way of doing things
    is VERY UGLY. We want to check to see if the lisp that is initiated is the
    one pointed to by the link in the executable dir, then if its not print
    the appropriate message. I also find the message printed out by EMACS when
    you get the wrong lisp equally UGLY and MORE dangerous for macsyma since
    macsyma can give WRONG answers if used with the wrong lisp not just
    STRANGE behavior.

Ok.  So if the wrong lisp is initiated, then punt and print a long,

    The error_table package is identical to the EMACS error-table package for
    getting standard Multics Error codes into the Lisp environment so the

I see.  I thought it had something to do with MERROR.

    The describe data-base is being stored in exactly the same format as on
    MC and almost all of the code is identical. The only difference is that
    the offsets into the describe data-base are stored on the plist of the
    symbols. Note that this info is NOT stored in the default Macsyma but
    the plists get updated the first time describe is called.

This may be faster using vfile_.  Ask a multician.

    I've decided that the terminate/initiate crock in macsyma.pl1 should be
    flushed as soon as the new lisp is installed, if not sooner.  It is totally
    losing that one cannot (1) start up an emacs and edit a macsyma batch file,
    (2) break to command level (^Z ^Z) and start up a macsyma to run it.
    Entering and exiting emacs (^X ^C) takes too long to be an effective debug
    cycle.  It is one thing to prevent a naive user from losing.  It is another
    to provide that protection at the expense of critical functionality,
    particularly when there are more winning ways of doing things.

    >unb, and if that is also true, print a message telling the user to tmr lisp
    and to use exl emacs.

    By no means should this brain-damage about having to be at level 1 be
    continued.

If people agree to the above scheme I'll try coding it up.

I created a new bound_nlisp_ this evening.  It fixed a few bugs and made
the probef modification requested by Jim.  macsyma_prelude.incl.lisp
should be updated.  I redumped >lib>macsyma>e>macsyma, but didn't bother
with any others since I may be making another installation shortly.

redefine_car should be renamed to macsyma_redefine_car_ and bound in with
the same segment as the rest of the Multics-specific stuff.  When includef
is added to Multics MacLisp, then we will no longer need to use nlcp, and
with some slight modifications, we will be able to use the compile_archive
and compile_file tools on the bound_nlisp_ and bound_macsyma_utils_
archives.  [Btw, is the bound_macsyma_pl1_ archive still used?  If so, its
entries should be added to bound_macsyma_utils_, as both archives are
quite small.]  When building the bind files, place the most frequently
used segments at the top of the bound segment to improve locality of
reference.

I think that since we promise to ship the sources for Macsyma that we might as

are pretty useless without nlisp.

    Carl. I was looking into having the multics garbage
    collector have the concept of PURE areas, or constant
    areas. If you think about it, you will realize how this
    relates to having more than one macsyma user environment.
    One does not need stack groups to do environment switching
    unless one wants multiprocessing.

    -gjc

Having part of the Lisp environment be pure (i.e. having Lisp environments
share storage) is a completely orthogonal issue.

Do you want two Macsymas in the same Lisp environment or in two separate
Lisp environments?  I presume you mean the former.  Have you thought about
the issues?  It is very complicated.

We should discuss this further in person.  I'll see you on Tuesday, anyway.

    Not really a bug, but a summary of a discussion between myself and GJC.
    GJC and I have both noticed that in checking out a translation of
    some macsyma functions, it is very convenient to have 2 macsymas running.

I presume by this you mean concurrent execution, as well as separate
execution contexts.

    I feel that even if space were not a consideration, I would
    prefer two macsymas for this situation.  GJC has pointed out that it
    would not be difficult to make an 'environment switch', and to give
    each environment a name, so you could hop from one to another easily.

If he is talking about doing some hack within Lisp, that sounds highly
implausible.  The problems are overwhelming.  Separate stacks, separate
obarrays, a scheduler, etc.  And two Macsymas cannot share the same Lisp
environment without clobbering one another.

    This would imitate what can be done in ITS with several jobs, and thus
    some of the convenience of ITS could be imitated at Multics.  But then we
    realized that macsyma-within-emacs would also mock this up very well.

Working within emacs doesn't buy you anything.  You still don't have
concurrent execution or separate environments.  Just the illusion that you
do.

         There are of course other situations where this capability would be
    useful.  For example, it is very convenient in large calculations that
    must be broken into parts for reasons of safety or convenience to store
    intermediate results as variables with certain standard names.  One might
    later wish to examine the properties of these intermediate results, but
    that is inconvenient if there is a name conflict.  Using two macsymas
    for this reason is rather extravagant, but at Multics it would be less so.
    I am sure that if this matter is given some more careful consideration
    than we have done today, many other advantages of multiple macsymas within
    emacs can be enumerated.

I am of course aware of what you are trying to accomplish.  The Lisp Machine
provides the environment you are looking for, much more powerfully than ITS
does.  Multics, however, was not designed with that model in mind, but
Multics is moving closer to that model.

For the time being, you can log in twice or you can use the absentee request
facility.  (I believe that information was sent to INFO-MULMAX about the new
macsyma_absentee command.)

Currently, the Multics group is actively developing a general purpose window
system for video terminals.  Others are working on multiple-stacks-per-user
and multiple-processes-per-user projects, although these are closer to the
experimental stage.  I would not be suprised if in two years time you can
cut the screen of a video console connected to Multics in half and run a
Macsyma in each one.  But there's really nothing we can do to speed this up.

	Isn't this disgusting?
    
    Truly. However, isn't there another level from which to read
    characters? Lets say a raw-readline with simple rubouts?
    [I've already heard that Emacs does gross hacks, lets assume we're
     not interested in that]. What of this multics basic-window-system?

Some terminology:

Multics					Lisp Machine

iox_$user_input				STANDARD-INPUT
    (pointers to message receiving objects)
get_chars, get_line			:TYI, :READ
    (message names)
call iox_$get_chars (s, buffer, 1)	(SETQ BUFFER (FUNCALL S ':TYI)
    (example of sending a message)
tty_, netd_, audit_			STREAM-MIXIN
    (collection of methods implementing a class of messages)

Input canonicalization and the interpretation of \, #, and @ is done by
the get_line handler of the tty_ io module (for terminals accessing
Multics via the FNP) or the netd_ io module (for access via the
ARPAnet).  Lisp directly invokes iox_$get_line on iox_$user_input, and
stores the input in an internal buffer.  TYI, in turn, reads
sequentially from this buffer.

If we wanted, we could define our own TYI to call iox_$get_chars and
enable "breakall" mode (character-at-a-time input).  If we wanted to be
hairy, we could hack echo-negotiation and only wake up on $, ;, and
editing characters.

For the time being, I think it is important to be consistent with the
rest of Multics, and leave #, @, and \ with their current definition.  I
say this since it appears as though the Multics input conventions will
be changing for the better.  Take a look in >exl>video_dir>info.   In
particular, look at the most recent MTB. The video system will be
changing the input conventions for printing terminals as well as video
terminals, and it is possible that \ will be flushed (perhaps in favor
of something like Control-Q in Emacs).  Printing terminal editing will
more closely resemble printing terminal Emacs.

The main point I am trying to make, though, is that a "what you see is
what you get" philosophy is being adopted.  # and @ will stick around
for a while (RUBOUT and ESC-RUBOUT have already been introduced), but
when you type #, the character will actually disappear and the # will
not echo.  On a printing terminal, a / will be overstruck on the deleted
character.)   So when something like Control-Q is typed, it will not
echo.  Only the quoted character will be echoed.  So what appears on
your screen is what will be sent to the application program, and this
should be much less confusing to users.  All this is possible since the
echoing of input, as in Emacs, will now be under the control of the crt_
io module, not the FNP.

This is my picture of things, anyway.  It may not be accurate.

    Don't forget that when you use double quotes, which
    is the syntax for a string, e.g.
    BUG("When I do SAVE([\"foo.bar\"],x) it bombs");
    you must "quote" any double-quotes you use inside, with
    the "\" character.

This only works through magic.  "\" is also the Multics quoting
character, but it has this brain damadged property that if it appears
in front of a character that doesn't NEED to be quoted, it just
behaves vanilla!  For example, here is the MINIMAL requoting of your
message:

BUG("BUG(\"When I do SAVE([\\\\\"foo.bar\\\\\"],x) it bombs\") is hard to type.");

The correct way to type a double quote in a string is \\" and the
correct way to type a backslash is \\\\, although \\\ will work
depending on the next character.

Isn't this disgusting?

 I have problems saving named varialbles in macsyma on
multics. I am using double quotes in the save command but i cannot
use it in a bug message. Earlier this morning i was able to save
named variables but since then it has started bombing out.
So it has worked and I have used it many times before

    When I try to save named variables macsyma bombs out.
    For example save([save.save],save1) would bomb. I do not
    know how to retrieve bug answers so please send me
    multics mail.

Filenames should be in double-quotes. e.g.
SAVE(["save.save"],save1); and
LOADFILE("save.save"); to get it back.

Otherwise in this case `save.save' gets parsed as matrix multiplication
of the symbols `save' and `save'.

    zunderflow:true 1.e-38-1.01e-38 -> -3E+10 i.e. exponent underflow
    during addition is not zeroed out (but * and / are O.K.)

This seems to be a bug in the LISP underlying Macsyma. If one does
(setq zunderflow t) 
(plus 1.0e-38 -1.01e-38)
you get a garbage answer. I don't know how soon we can reasonably expect this
bug to be fixed. Can you give us a rating of its importance to you on a scale
of 1 to 10. 10 being very important.

I might suggest tho' that for number crunching Macsyma is a very poor 
sledge hammer and you might be better off learning how to make PL1 
functions that can be called by lisp. The pl1 would then do the crunching.

Of course this is no excuse for the bug but.......

Thanks for your help,
Jim.

There is a new command available for running Macsyma jobs absentee.  This
command provides a simple mechanism for running Macsyma computations without
actually being logged in.

>udd>Mathlab>Macsyma>macsyma_absentee (short name = mabs) takes as a required
argument an input file name, and as optional arguments a CPU time limit in
minutes (default = 100) and absentee queue (default = 4).  The input file
must be a sequence of Macsyma commands as would be accepted by the Macsyma
"batch" request, and must have the ".macsyma" suffix.  As usual, specifying
the suffix in the command invocation is not necessary.  Users on the Mathlab
and Macsyma projects have this command in their search rules, so need only
type "macsyma_absentee" (or "mabs") to invoke it.

The sequence of steps for running an absentee job is:

1) Create file.macsyma containing a sequence of macsyma commands.
2) Type "macsyma_absentee file".
3) Output will go to "file.absout".

Users wishing to have greater control over the running of the absentee job
should invoke enter_absentee_request directly, using the absin file
>udd>Mathlab>Macsyma>ec>macsyma_absentee.absin, and with an argument of the
batch file name, as in

    ear macsyma_absentee {additional control arguments} -ag file.macsyma

According to an experiment I just ran, MTRACE uses up 27 records of the
process directory.  This is pretty bad.  We were forgetting to figure in the
sizes of symbols and print-name strings when determining the amount of space
taken up by interpreted code.  The current sizes of the lisp environments
are shown below:

minima:		122 records
macsyma:	243 records
dmacsyma:	266 records

Seeing that MTRACE occupies more than 10 percent of the initial environment,
I would feel that getting it to run compiled would be a high priority task.

Some recent changes to Multics Macsyma:

* Two bugs in the Lisp garbage collector were fixed.  These fixes in turn
  corrected several problems we had been having with Macsyma involving
  computations with bignums and creating new systems.  Thanks to Rich Lamson
  and Barry Trager for this outstanding work.

* Jim O'Dell tracked down the "last" bug in the bigfloat package.

* The commands "minima", "macsyma", and "dmacsyma" can now be used to
  start up a macsyma.  The "minima" command loads only the in-core system,
  i.e.  that portion which is loaded when Macsyma is invoked on the PDP-10.
  Computations within a "minima" will run somewhat faster than inside a
  "macsyma" as the size of the Lisp environment is smaller.  Out-of-core
  files do not currently autoload into this environment, so it should only
  be used by Mathlab members and sophisticated users.  The "macsyma" command
  loads both the in-core and out-of-core systems.  This is intended to be
  the standard command accessible to users.  The "dmacsyma" command (for
  debug macsyma) loads the full compile-time environment (both Lisp and
  Macsyma macro files) and enables the Lisp *rset and nouuo switches.  It
  also loads a package which assists in debugging interpreted Lisp code.
  This command is useful only to Lisp-level Macsyma programmers.  These
  commands have been available for some time, although I don't believe they
  were announced.

* I modified the runtime environment somewhat to reduce the size of the
  Macsyma save segments.  This helps speedup the initial load time and
  the time needed for garbage collection.  The extra space was being
  wasted due to sloppiness on my part in the initial rush to bring the
  system up.  Further optimizations of this form are possible, but will
  require somewhat more work, so don't hold your breath.

  With a 1024 record process directory, there are 855 free records for a
  minima, and 753 free records for a macsyma.  That translates to 213K
  cons cells for a minima, and 188K cons cells for a macsyma, as opposed
  to 50K on the PDP-10.  My earlier estimates were overly pessimistic.
  Users on the Macsyma project have 2048K process directories, so they
  can roughly double these figures.  Users on the Student project can
  request 2048K process directories by contacting the SIPB.

  Larger address spaces can be constructed by using the
  set_lisp_temp_dir command, and may ultimately be limited only by the
  amount of available disk space on the machine.  I recommend that you
  contact a member of the Mathlab group before running a job that
  requires this much address space.  Be careful that there is not an
  Emacs on your stack before running a large Macsyma computation, as it
  uses about 100 records of your process dir.
  
* There now exists a Macsyma command called "cline" (for command line),
  which is analagous to the Lisp "cline" function.  It takes a single
  string argument and passes it to the Multics command processor.  So,
  one can type

     cline("list");

  to list the contents of the current working directory.  This feature was
  implemented by Jim O'Dell.  Further extensions of this sort for Multics users
  are planned.

For Mathlab members:

* It is now possible to load a macsyma into an emacs for interactive
  debugging purposes.  Load the segment>udd>Mathlab>Macsyma>macsyma_loader_,
  and answer the questions appropriately.  Macsyma I/O doesn't work
  correctly yet (we're working on it), but you can invoke Macsyma routines
  by calling from within Lisp Debug mode.

* The dump_minima, dump_macsyma, and dump_dmacsyma commands will generate
  new versions of each of the systems described above.  In addition, you can
  type dump_all_macsymas to do these three operations in sequence.

* The update_macsyma_loader command will compile and install a new version
  of the Macsyma loader.

The PDP10 MacLisp lsubr SYMBOLCONC has been added to the Multics
compatibility package and the definition removed from LIBMAX;MFORMA.  (The
definition in MFORMA was broken anyway since it failed to define it at
compile time.)  Could the Franz people also add this to their compatibility
package?

If you want to win with gensymmed named functions geneated by
lcp, you should have a fairly unique (declare (genprefix ...))
in each file.  If someone wants to hack the compiler (I have
deliberately stopped doing this), p1gfy should be changed to
generate the genprefix name from the top-level source-file
name or something.  It may be possible to eval up a genprefix
in an include file that dredges back into instack to get
the right chunk of the namelist of the bottom of it or similar....

I don't think FIXNUMP should be added to nlisp or used in Macsyma since it
is needed only for implementation dependent code.  Macsyma should try to
only use the notion of an integer.  It is not something we would want to
encourage frequent use of, and it hardly buys anything.  We need more
powerful techniques to know when to open and close compile forms like
(EQUAL X 3).

Perhaps we could define a special form like

    (DEFUN-CRITICAL F (X) ...)

where forms like (EQUAL X 3) which appear inside get open-compiled.  We can
do this at the source level and would allow us to play interesting games to
see how things improve when certain functions are compiled differently.

More on FSET: Currently, FSET on the PDP10 simply macros into a PUTPROP onto
the EXPR property.  If this isn't sufficient for what MTRACE needs to do
(i.e. it manipulates subr properties), take the definition of FSET in
CWH;FSET and install it in MAXSRC;UTILS with a #+PDP10.  That definition is
already installed in nlisp on Multics, and NIL, Franz, and the Lispm all
have winning FSETs.
