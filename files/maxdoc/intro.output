############################## Draft ##############################

The canonical Macsyma output routine should be MFORMAT. It takes the
general form:

	(MFORMAT stream control-string &rest data-list)

MFORMAT prints several arguments according to a control argument.
The control-string is a string which is for the most part just printed,
except that the character ~ starts an escape sequence which directs other
actions. A ~ escape sequence has an (optional) numeric parameter followed,
optionally, by either or both of the modifiers @ and :, followed finally by
a mode character.  These escape actions can use up one or more of the 
non-control arguments.

A stream of T defaults to STANDARD-OUTPUT.

Possible escape sequences are:

Topic	Variants	Description

~%			Insert a newline.
	~n%		Insert n newlines.

~&			Get a fresh line (ie, newline if not at head of 
			  line already)

~M			Print an expression in display (output-style) form.
	~:M		Print an expression in linear  (input-style) form.
	~@M		Print an expression but make sure to do GETOP on it
                        if atomic. (e.g. MTIMES => &*).
        ~:@M            Both of above.

~A			Lisp PRINC the object.

~S			Lisp PRINT the object.

~<cr>			Eats the <cr> and leading whitespace on next line.
			  For indenting format strings. Sample usage:
			  (MFORMAT T "This is line 1.~
				    ~% and this is line 2 indented 1 space.")
