			Information hacking

KILL1 -       SUBR form of Macsyma's KILL command. Accepts one arg
	      and kills the atom + value cell and properties from the
	      Macsyma system.

			Error Checking

ERLIST -      Takes an arg of a message. Atomic messages are PRINC'd. Lists
	      are PRINL'd. Types the message and then signals an error.

ERREXP -      Takes no args. Types out "ERREXP contains the offending
	      expression." Note that ERREXP must be SETQ'd 'by hand'. This
	      function does not do that for you.

FEXPRCHK -    SUBR of 2 args. Arg 1 is a FEXPR arg-list. Arg 2 is the 
	      'pretty' name of the function for display if an error 
	      is seen. Checks to see that Arg 1 is exactly 1 element
	      long. Errs out if it's not.

NONSYMCHK -   SUBR of 2 args. Arg 1 is any lisp object. Arg 2 is the 
	      'pretty' name of the function for display if an error 
	      is seen. Checks to see that exactly Arg 1 an atomic symbol.
	      Errs out if it's not.

			I/O Hacking

PRINL -	      Accepts a single list as an arg. PRINC's each of the elements
	      of the list separated by spaces.

			Printname hacking, etc.

$NOUNIFY -    Makes a non-Noun into a noun. Accepts a symbol as an arg.
	      If the symbol has a verb property, uses that.
              If the thing is a NOUN, it returns its arg.
              Else strips a leading M or "$" from the printname 
		   and puts a "%" on. Puts the <verb> form in the NOUN
		   property of the <verb> and the <noun> in the VERB
	           property of the <noun>. 

$VERBIFY -    Makes a non-VERB into a verb. Accepts a symbol as an arg.
	      If the symbol has a noun property, uses that.
	      If the arg is a VERB or doesn't start with "%", just returns it.
	      Else strips the %, adds a $. Calls NOUNIFY to set up all
		   the VERB/NOUN properties, and returns what's in the thing's
		   NOUN property.

CONCAT -      Any number of args. Puts the printnames of all the args together
	      as an interned symbol. Eg, (CONCAT '$ 'C 13.) => $C13
	      Binds *NOPOINT to T and BASE to 10. during the operation.

DOLLARIFY -   Put a dollarsigns on any symbols in a Lisp list. Returns
	      `((MLIST SIMP) . <dollarified-input-list>)

FULLSTRIP1 -  Remove dollarsign (like STRIPDOLLAR) and also do any inverse
	      aliasing according to defined ALIAS's.

FULLSTRIP -   MAPCAR's a FULLSTRIP1 across its arg.

GETOP -	      Gets the operand form of an operator.
	      E.g. (GETOP 'MPLUS) is &+ which corresponds to "+" .

GETOPR -      Gets the operator form of an operand.
	      E.g. (GETOPR '&+) is MPLUS.

MEXPLODEN -   Like Lisp's EXPLODEN function, but binds BASE to 10 and
	      *NOPOINT to T during the process.

MAKSTRING* -  Like STRING* but returns a list of atomic symbols instead
	      of fixnums.

MSTRING -     A Macsyma-flavored EXPLODEN function which works on arbitrary
	      expressions except MTEXT and MLABLE. Returns a list of the
	      fixnum characters that make up the expressions strung out
	      representation.

STRING* -     A Macsyma-flavored EXPLODEN function - for atomic objects
	      only. Returns the list of fixnums that make up the Macsyma
	      printname of the object.

STRING*1 -    A faster version of STRING*. Expects that NUMBERP and ALIAS
	      checks have already been done.

STRIPDOLLAR - Turn a lisp atom or BIGFLOAT form into its Macsyma display
	      form. (Strips the &, $ or & if any from the head of the 
	      printname of symbols, turns ((BIGFLOAT SIMP <m>) <n>) into
              its more pretty form.)

			Filename hacking

FILESTRIP -   Converts a MACSYMA file specification into a LISP file 
	      specification. NB: it also sets the DEFAULTF, beware.

MTRUENAME -   Accepts a lisp file-object as an arg. Returns the Dollarified
	      name of the file.

TRUEFNAME -   Gets the TRUENAME of a filename. (Opens file, calls lisp
	      TRUENAME, then closes file).

			Predicates 

$LISTP -      Returns T if its arg is an MLIST.

$BFLOATP -    Returns T if its arg is a bigfloat number.

ALIKE1 -      Use this predicate on Macsyma objects as you would use EQUAL on
	      Lisp objects. It compares everything in the object except the
	      flags in the CDAR of lists (it does notice tho' if one object
	      is an array and another isn't and will return FALSE in that
	      case -- all other flags are ignored).

MEMALIKE -    Just like MEMBER in LISP except uses ALIKE1 instead of EQUAL.

ASSOL -       Just like ASSOC in LISP except uses ALIKE1 instead of EQUAL.

ASSOLIKE -    (CDR (ASSOL X L))

FREE -        SUBR of two args.  Checks to see if its first arg is free of 
	      its second arg.  Both args are assumed to be MACSYMA 
	      expressions in general representation.

AMONG -       SUBR of two args.  Checks to see if its first arg is 
	      contained in its second arg.  Both args are assumed to be 
	      fully general expressions (i.e. not necessarily in general 
	      representation).  For this reason, (NOT (FREE EXP VAR)) is
	      much more efficient than (AMONG VAR EXP), which would 
	      otherwise amount to the same thing, if both EXP and VAR are 
	      in general representation.

ALPHABETP -   Returns T if its arg is an atomic symbol whose first character
	      is an alphabetic character or has a non-null ALPHABET property.

			List Hacking

ASSQR -	      Like ASSQ but checks against the CDR instead of the CAR. 
	      Returns the first CONS in arg 2 whose CDR is EQ to arg 1.

ADD2LNC -     Arg1 is an object and Arg2 is an MLIST to union the object
	      with. If Arg1 is in the MLIST, no change occurs. If Arg1 is
	      is not in the list, it is spliced onto the end of the list 
	      with NCONC.

$CONS -	      Like LISP's CONS, but does the right thing with the (MLIST) in
	      the CAR of the of the list. [Explicitly checks that second
	      arg is an MLIST.]

$FIRST -      A Macsyma flavored CAR.

$REST -	      A Macsyma flavored CDR. (Removes any flags from the CDAR of
	      the form that was its arg, but doesn't care if its arg wasn't
	      a MLIST.)     


			Application of user supplied FUNARGS.

MAPPLY -      A Macsyma flavored APPLY. (MAPPLY fun arg-list fun-name) uses
	      applies FUN to arg-list. Fun-name is what is referred to if an
	      error occurs.

MCALL -       A Macsyma flavored FUNCALL. (MCALL 'F arg1 arg2 ...) is the
	      same as (MAPPLY 'F (list arg1 arg2 ...) 'F).

FLOAT-GENCALL A macro for fast general numerical calls to user supplied
              funargs. See LIBMAX;NUMMAC

                         Evaluation.
     
              Any call to the macsyma evaluator not within the evaluator
              itself has far-ranging effects on the entire system. It
	      should not be used for trivial functionalities such as
	      substitution and simplification. This information is only
              provided for the sake of reading old code.

$EV   -       Should NEVER be used in lisp code.

MEVAL -	      A Macsyma flavored EVAL. Both evaluation and simplification.
	      Same as (SIMPLIFYA (MEVAL1 form) NIL).

MEVAL1 -      A Macsyma flavored EVAL that does only evaluation. No final
	      simplification is done on the result.

MBIND, MUNBIND - Macsyma variable "binding".
