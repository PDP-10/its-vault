                    USING THE EMACS BIBTEX LIBRARY

The BibTex library is a modification by Rich@AI of the Biblio library
written by CTaylor@ISIF.  This documentation is supplementary to
Emacs:Biblio.Info, and summarizes the few simple basic commands needed
to use BibTex.  This documentation also assumes that you are familiar
with BibTex itself (see Appendix B of the Latex manual).

* SETTING THINGS UP

Bibliographic database files for use with BibTex/Latex must have the
.BIB extension.  To provide for editing of these files in BibTex
(sub)mode, put the string -*-BibTex-*- somewhere in the first line of
the file, for example, as shown below.

@Comment ( My Bibliography Database in -*-BibTex-*- )

When you read in this file, your buffer will automatically go into Tex
mode with BibTex submode (shown in the status line as Tex-Bibtex).

If you happen to have a separate file of @String abbreviations (e.g.
so you can use different abbreviations for different journals),
you need to set the variable "BibTex String File" to tell the Compile
command (see below) about it.  This is most easily done in the file
itself using the Local Modes feature.  For example, you can
put something like the following at the very end of your .BIB file.
(Note the ^L below is not a real control-L.  It needs to be changed
into one to work properly.)  You can also set the variable BibTex
Title, which changes the default title on listing the file.
Finally, you can set the variable BibTex Bibliographystyle to change
the style used in printing the master file.  (If you want to use
the default of Key, you don't need to set the variable.)

^L
Local Modes:
BibTex String File:PS:<MYDIR>MYABBREVS
BibTex Title:My Bibliography
BibTex Bibliographystyle:Key
End:

Finally, there is an optional display mode in which the top three
lines of the screen permanently show the possible entry types.
You can get this display using the command "M-X Show BibTex Entries"
(see below) once you are in BibTex mode; or else adding the
following variable initialization to your Emacs.Vars file causes
this display to be the default.

BibTex Window:1





* BASIC KEYBOARD COMMANDS IN BIBTEX MODE

M-Space		After typing an entry name (e.g. @article), this command
		expands into the template for this type of entry.  Note
		that typing Space would do the same, but leave a space
		before the key.

M-N		Go to next field.
M-P		Go to previous field.

M-C-N		Go to next blank field.
M-C-P		Go to previous blank field.

M-]		Go to end of current entry.
M-[		Go to start (key) of current entry.

M-.		When you are finished typing in all the required and
		some of the optional fields, this commands gets rid
		of the remaining blank fields.

M-/		This is the inverse of M-.  It puts back all the
		possible optional blank fields.

M-@		Mark the current entry.  (Handy for deleting with C-W.)

M-?		Prints out short summary of commands.

* OTHER COMMANDS IN BIBTEX MODE

M-X Show BibTex	Toggles whether entry names are shown at top 3 lines (use
		in BibTex Mode only).

M-0 M-X BibTex	Takes you out of BibTex Mode.  M-X Bibtex puts you back.
