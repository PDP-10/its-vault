**  			The Story of Polly Nomial                           **
**                                                                          **
**       Wherein it is related how that paragon of womanly virtue, young    **
**  Polly Nomial (our heroine) is accosted by that notorious villain Curly  **
**  Pi, and factored (oh, horror!).                                         **
**                                                                          **
**       Once upon a time (1/t) pretty Polly Nomial was strolling across a  **
**  field of vectors when she came upon the boundary of a singularly large  **
**  matrix.  Now Polly was convergent, and her mother had made it an        **
**  absolute condition that she never enter an array without her brackets   **
**  on. Polly, however, who had changed her variables that morning and was  **
**  feeling particularly badly behaved, ignored this condition on the basis **
**  that it was insufficient, and made her way in amongst the complex       **
**  elements. Rows and columns closed in from all sides.  Tangents          **
**  approached her surface. She became tensor and tensor. Quite suddenly,   **
**  two branches of a hyperbola touched her at a single point. She          **
**  oscillated violently, lost all sense of directrix, and went completely  **
**  divergent. As she reached a turning point, she tripped over a square    **
**  root that was protruding from the erf and plunged headlong down a steep **
**  gradient. When she rounded off once more, she found herslef inverted,   **
**  apparently alone, in a non-euclidean space.                             **
**                                                                          **
**       She was being watched, however,. That smooth operator, Curly Pi    **
**  was lurking innerproduct. As his eyes devoured her curvilinear          **
**  coordinates, a singular expression crossed his face. He wondered,       **
**  was she still convergent.  He decided to integrate improperly at once.  **
**                                                                          **
**       Hearing a common fraction behind her, Polly rotated and saw Curly  **
**  Pi approaching with his power series extrapolated. She could see at     **
**  once by his degenerate conic and dissipative terms that he was bent on  **
**  no good.                                                                **
**                                                                          **
**       "Arcsinh," she gasped.                                             **
**                                                                          **
**       "Ho, ho," he said.  "What a symmetric little asymptote you have. I **
**  can see your angles have a lot of secs."                                **
**                                                                          **
**       "Oh sir," she protested, "keep away from me. I haven't got my      **
**  brackets  on."                                                          **
**                                                                          **
**       "Calm yourself, my dear," said our suave operator.  "Your fears    **
**  are purely imaginary."                                                  **
**                                                                          **
**       I, I she thought.  Perhaps he's not normal but homologous.         **
**                                                                          **
**       "What order are you?" the brute demanded.                          **
**                                                                          **
**       "Seventeen," replied Polly.                                        **
**                                                                          **
**       Curly leered.  "I suppose you've never been operated on."          **
**                                                                          **
**       "Of course not!" Polly replied, quite properly.  "I'm absolutely   **
**  convergent."                                                            **
**                                                                          **
**       "Come, come" said Curly.  "Let's off to a decimal place I know and **
**  I'll  take you to the limit."                                           **
**                                                                          **
**       "Never!" gasped Polly.                                             **
**                                                                          **
**       "Abscissa!" he swore, using the vilest oath he knew. His patience  **
**  was gone. Coshing her oever the coefficient with a log until she was    **
**  powerless, Curly removed her discontinuities. He started at her         **
**  significant places, and began smoothing out her points of inflection.   **
**  Poor Polly. The algorithmic method was now her only hope. She felt his  **
**  hand tending toward her asymptotic limit. Her convergence would soon be **
**  gone forever.                                                           **
**                                                                          **
**       There was no mercy, for Curly was a heavyside operator. Curly's    **
**  radius squared itself. Polly's loci quivered. He integrated by parts.   **
**  He integrated by partial fractions. After he cofactored, he performed   **
**  Runge-Kutta on her.  The complex beast even went all the way around and **
**  did a contour integration. Curly went on operating until he had         **
**  satisfied her hypothesis, then he exponentiated and became completely   **
**  orthogonal.                                                             **
**                                                                          **
