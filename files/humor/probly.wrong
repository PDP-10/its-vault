Re:   ABC NEWS REINVENTS STATISTICS

YESTERDAY BOTH THE MASSACHUSETTS AND NEW HAMPSHIRE LOTTERIES HAD THE SAME FOUR
DIGIT LOTTERY NUMBER.  ABC NEWS REPORTED THE ODDS OF THIS AT 100 MILLION
TO ONE.  THOSE OF US WHO KNOW THAT THE CORRECT ODDS ARE 10,000 TO ONE WONDER
WHAT THE ODDS ARE OF ABC RETAINING CREDIBILITY IN REPORTING SIMPLE SCIENTIFIC
EVENTS.
