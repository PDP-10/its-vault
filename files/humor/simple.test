          HISTORY-  Describe the history of the papacy from the origin to
		    present day, concentrating especially but not ex-
		    clusively on its social, political, economic, religious,
		    and philosophical impact on Europe, Asia, America, and

       PSYCHOLOGY-  Based on your knowledge of their works, evaluate the
		    emotional stability, degree of adjustment, and re-
		    pressed frustrations of each of the following:

       	 MEDICINE-  You have been provided with a razor blade, a piece of

		    Calm them.  You may use any language except Latin or 
		    Greek.

		    been placed in a box on your desk.  You will also find
		    an instruction manual, printed in Swahili.  In ten minutes
		    a hungry Bengal Tiger will be admitted to the room.
		    Take whatever action you feel appropriate.  Be prepared
		    to justify your decision.
