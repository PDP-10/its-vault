This directory is just a place to put humorous SMALL files
so that they won't get in the way of real work. No guarantees
expressed or implied that the dir won't get garbage collected
at any time if disk space becomes needed. Probably most stuff
GC'd will be retrievable from Backup tape tho' if this does 
happen.

ps All files on this dir should be kept on the secondary pack.

pps I created HUMOR1; to deal with the overflow.
