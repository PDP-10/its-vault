SOMEWHERE IN THE PAST I ACQUIRED A DISK WITH A PROGRAM CALLED
MICROLISP.  WHEN I LISTED IT I FOUND IT WAS A COPYRIGHT PROGRAM
OF APPLE COMPUTER INC OF 1978.  THE DATE ON THE PROGRAM IS
16-JUN-78.  WE HAVE RECENTLY BECOME INTERESTED IN THE LISP
LANGUAGE AS AN ARTIFICIAL LANGUAGE BUT SINCE WE DO NOT HAVE THE
DOCUMENTATION FOR THIS PROGRAM WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS.  IF
ANYONE CAN TELL ME HOW TO GET THE DOCUMENTATION OR THE PROGRAM
WITH DOCUMENTATION I WOULD APPRECIATE IT.  IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER
VERSIONS OF LISP FOR THE APPLE THAT ARE NOT PROPRIETARY I WOULD
BE INTERESTED IN GETTING A COPY.  WE NEED THE LANGUAGE TO SET UP
AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLEGENCE PROGRAM TIED TO A WATER ANALYSIS
MONITOR FOR THE ARMY.  THIS IS AN INFANT IDEA AND WE WOULD FIRST
LIKE TO BECOME MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE POTENTIAL OF THIS AND OTHER
AI LANGUAGES.  SEND ANY HELP TO DRDME-G(ESKELUND).  THANKS.
