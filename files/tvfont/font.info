(forgive my previous incomplete message, please)

I think we should keep the list of supported fonts to a reasonable
size: extra fonts can be left as "user-supported", although it is
probably sensible to catalogue them and have them in one place on
the system, say FontsU, so that :find font**; will work.

In particular, the fingerspelling and tengwar (whatever that is)
fonts seem candidates for this treatment.  Of the foreign-language
fonts, only Greek seems generally useful (I say this not out of
chauvinism, but simply because Greek is used in mathematics often:
the Greek fonts aren't really set up for text at the moment anyway.)
The Hebrew, IPA, Cyrillic, and Arabic fonts are not really used:
not even aleph, beth, and gimel, which are used in set theory, are
used much here.  Again these are candidates for user support, at
least for now.

Modified fonts are rather a crock (super- and sub-scripts, rotated
letters); the former at least should be handled by the justifiers.

There are two possibly useful tools for hacking fonts: CFFK's (formerly
CFK) font reader for Lisp (not to be confused with HGB's, which
doesn't read fonts but only some parameters); and my as-yet-unfinished
Teco package for hacking AST.

I am interested in receiving news about new font developments
and changes to existing fonts.  Please put me on your FONT-USERS
list.  The major facility I need  (new fonts and/or new text
justifiers)  is for producing mathematical expressions that
resemble those found in books and take more than one line
in output.  If you know of any fonts or programs that would
help me in this respect, please let me know.  The file
AI:FONTS1;25FGEX KST  contains some fonts I use for this purpose
and may be of interest to you too.  The file contains
symbols for brackets, parenthesis, braces, and an integral
sign that print in 3 lines.

Did anyone respond to his request to know who we are?
If so, I would like to know so I won't send him a
duplicate message.

P.S. -- We should select one of Font-Hackers to handle
this sort of stuff in the future, and also to handle
local net mail.  In other words, one of us should
volunteer to handle all correspondence with local
net XGP users (on ITS machines, Gould, etc.) including
maintaining mailing lists, and another of our number
should handle all non-local network people interested
in our work (SAIL, ISI, CMU, ...).  This way, we can
keep ALL the mail from going to ALL Font-Hackers,
as well as provide a definite name to be used as a
handle.

Do I have volunteers?

	This is another plug for the currently missing fonts
needed for scientific papers.  They are:
		Script		(Most important)
		Bold Greek.
Using the XGP, you can do a better job than several scientific
journals;  so it would be nice if all their fonts can be
accomodated.  (At present you have to include marginal notes to
the typesetter - "Set German ell as u.c. script ell".)  It's
also a pity that only 1 justifying program (viz. TXJ) makes
any attempt to make full use of the XGP's potential;  but
I guess that's outside your province.

Yes, indeed when I first copied the stanford and cmu fonts, I performed the work
of installing ascii compatible characters.  Our current position is:

code	mit character	stanford character

13	up arrow	vertical tab
30	left arrow	underscore
31	right arrow	right arrow
32	tilde		not equals
33	escape (lozenge)	not equals
136	circumflex	up arrow
137	underscore	left arrow
175	right brace	escape
176	tilde		right brace

The constraints we worked under were 1. conformity to new ascii graphics
2.  inclusion of all the special case sail graphics so we could use their software
Circumflex is not in the stanford set, so we had to appropriate a code for it.  
vertical tab was judged sufficiently worthless to use, despite anger of the ascii gods.
The graphic significance of the remaining < 40 codes are the same as at stanford.
Several of the codes have both a control and graphic significance.  At MIT the
backspace (alias lambda) is usually backspace.  Bell, alias pi, is also usually bell here.
I think you will find that explains some of the escape code sequences in the XGP driver
you got from here, though they may have been changed.

There is just starting here an uprising by the more graphically conscious among the
multitude with the aim of producing a good selection of fonts.  It seems likely that
the eventual set will ditch the stanford graphics for <40 and use those codes for 
ligatures, but this is not certain.

	Tom,

	Please forward this message on, if you are not the right guy to contact.
	We have run into many problems because of the differences between most of
	our fonts, and standard ascii.  Most notable problems are the leftarrow
	and uparrow, as opposed to underbar and circumflex.  Les Earnest's "Find
	a font" note gave some examples of what different sites use for different
	chars, and it appeared that while SAIL, CMU, and ISI used essentially
	the SAIL set, you guys were using ascii standard for chars 40-177.  Is
	this true?  Also, have you developed a "standard" for chars 0-37?  If
	so, I'd like to get a copy of it, and if not I'd like to work one out.
	
	Thanks.

Following is a copy of a message sent to Pete Alfvin@USC-ISID.
Comments?

TK forwarded your message onto me.  We have just recently
instituted a XGP Fonts Support Group here in hopes of
really improving the font system, by introducing new sets
of fonts, getting rid of unused or unattractive fonts, and
cleaning up those good fonts we have.  In addition, we are
preparing a style manual for the general user community.
Brian Ried@CMU and Tovar@SAIL are supposed to be in on 
this as well.  We'd like to have people from Xerox PARC
and ISI, if they are willing.  We can be reached here
via FONT-HACKERS@MIT-AI.

In response to your questions:

It is true that the sites you mentioned seem to want to
use the SAIL character set, although we are trying to get
away from that, at least as far fonts go (our Knight
terminals have the SAIL set built in, and most of our
current fonts do too).  Instead, we are attempting to
do everything in a more standardized way, somewhat com-
patible with the typesetting industry.  Long range goals
include some super text formatters, but that doesn't
concern us yet.  We have a tentative plan for developing
new fonts, in standard packages (a set of sizes and styles
for each font), which are base on Ascii, not SAIL, with
complete special character fonts.  Many people here do not
like the idea of making control-character assignments,
since they inevitably overlap the used control chars (like
altmode, ff, cr, lf, tab).  Furthermore, once there is a
preassigned alphabet which takes up all slots, there is no
room for inserting certain chars that vary from font to font.
Certainly, the English text fonts should have the Ascii
standard set, the Ascii alternate chars (back- and up-arrow),
ligatures (for variable-width fonts -- this is part of the
typesetting standardization), and some additional useful
items like forward and backward double and single quotes
(the curled kind looking like 6's or 9's), a dash, a minus
(both different from a hyphen).  This kind of stuff, of
course, does not appear in foreign language fonts, or in
the special math, drawing, decorative text, etc. fonts.

In any case, this is a matter which certainly should be
looked into further.  Let us know what you think.

Cheers, Bob Sjoberg

Actually, the number in the name of a font is almost totally irrelevant
to typesetting considerations, given the ;vsp kludge.  The two parameters
of interest are [a] total height INCLUDING THE VERTICAL SPACING (this
divided into an inch gives lines per inch), and [b] the height of a
capital letter (necessary to decide how well fonts will mix).
If one chooses to measure [a] downward from the top of a capital letter,
then [b] is the downward distance to the baseline, as stored now.
Ideally, fonts would be designed so that normally one would use
a vertical spacing of zero. (MOON,RMS,MRC: would this cause any timing
problems for the XGP; i.e., was the ;vsp thing designed to give the
PDP-11 time to think between lines?)  This would cure several
great screws, including various picture fonts which need ;vsp 0,
and allow fonts designers complete control over standard line spacing.
(Naturally ;vsp would be retained in order to do 1 1/2 spacing, etc.)
We ought to find out from a design book what the usual total height
to baseline height ratio is.

As for being compatible with real type in terms of height:
is the XGP's vertical resolution 192/in or 200/in?
If the former, we are in great shape, as 192 divides evenly by 6.

I would greatly prefer if the height of a font was the height and
did not automatically include someone's random idea of how much vsp
I want.  I.e. if you use ;vsp 0 and print a lower case g on one line
and a capital M on the next they should touch.  Text justifiers can
default the vsp according to the size of the font and the "desirable"
proportions if they want.

The number in the name of the font is there, I presume, to give you
an idea of how high the letters are.

I wouldn't know whether the 11 needs vsp for extra time but I doubt it.
Ask TK.

Well, a good way to implement this would be to define characters
in the font in the current manner, but have in the font file also
the standard inter-line distance (this minus font-height = vsp).
Another theory is to allow negative vsp, though it might work
only if the lines didn't really overlap.
One problem we have been suffering from (and GJS and I can vouch
for this, as we have been consulting for these automated typesetting
people) is that, as programmers, we have invented our own universe
and for the most part ignored what typesetters have been doing
for years, much of which makes sense.  I have never found any earthly
use for knowing how high letters are, other than for an "eq" test
when mixing fonts.  Total height, however, would let you compute
lines per inch and other useful parameters.
It is not at all clear why M and g should touch for vsp=0 rather
than vsp=-4, for example.  After all, g and vertical-bar, say,
might very well descend by different amounts.

The METS, METSI, ..., METLI are nicer looking than most of the other crufty
fonts, however, they were apparently made by simple-mindedly enlarging
smaller fonts, and a little editing to smooth off the corners might improve
them greatly, especially the italics.
