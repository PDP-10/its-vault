Subject: Space-War Binaries
Date: 25 OCT 1976 1749-EDT

Lately, there has been some confusion over what files exist on AI  for  playing
SpaceWar.   This  message  presents a summary of the files currently available.
All files in question are on AI:KLH;


SPCWAR BIN:         The current version of the game.  This file is  actually  a
                    link  to  the proper binary file.  This version of the game
                    should have few (ha!) if any bugs.

SPCWAR OBIN:        The previous version  of  the  game.   This  file  is  also
                    normally a link, but it may not always exist.

SPCWAR NBIN:        The "new" or next version of the game.  This file does  not
                    always  exist  either  and  may  sometimes be a link.  This
                    binary is a version of the game that is going  through  its
                    final  debugging.  If people feel like helping, they should
                    use this game and report problems to SPACEWAR-PEOPLE.

SPCWAR XBIN:        An experimental game which should not be  used  unless  you
                    are  debugging  it.  This file does not always exist either
                    and is guarenteed to  be  laden  with  bugs  or  perhaps  a
                    version that runs under ITS and not the PDP-6.

SPCBIN ******:      These files are the actual binary files which are  normally
                    pointed to by SPCWAR BIN and SCPWAR OBIN.
