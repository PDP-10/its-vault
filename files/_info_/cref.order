CREF COMMAND STRINGS:
(NOTE THAT GIVING :CRECMMAND>
  TO DDT IS EQUIVALENT TO G5Ώ <COMgD}^C TOE)

1) NON CONCATENATED FORMAT:
S$ө_INPUVIPUT2,...,INPUTN

EACH I*AFILE IS CREFFEDЃRATELY.
SWITCHGVEN WITH THE LIST FILE APPLY TO ALL THE INPUT FILES;
THOSE GIVEN WITH AN INPUT FILE APPLY TO Tj ILE ONLY.
THE kIE DEFAULTS TO DSK FOR 1ST FILE,
   ATER ONES, SAME AS PREVIOUSLY.
EAC$ΡUT FILENAME2 DEj̩S INDIVIDUALLY TO 'CREF'.

IF THE$ө IS ON THE LPT OR IF A 1ST NAME WAS PECIFIED FOR IT, THE OUTPUT FROM AL*H INPUT FILES GO
  INTO THE SAME LIST FILE.
$EWISE,`Ñ INPUT FILE IS CREFFED INTO A DIFFERENT OUTPUT FILE,
  WHICH HAS$EASAME 4 AME Ah*H INPUT FILE.

IF THE LIuSEC. IS NULL, THE LIST FILE IS THE TPL.
  IN THAT CASE, THE ARROW MAY BE OMITTED.
OTHERWISE, THE DEVICE cALTS TO DSK AND "eND NAME TO 'CREb']


2) CONCATENATED FORMAT:

LIST/C_INPUT1,INPUT2,...,INPUTN

ALL THE INPUT FILES ARE CREFFED TOGETHER.
INPUT FILENAMES ARE DEFAULTED AS ABOVE.
SWITCHES SHOULD BE GIVEN WITH THE LIST FILE.
THE LIST FILE NAMES DEFAULT AS ABOVE BUT ONLY ONE LIST FILE IS USED.


SWITCHES:

/D		CAUSES CREF TO GIVE TTY BACK TO DDT AND RUN DISOWNED,
		  LOGGING ITSELF OUT AFTER COMPLETING THE COMMAND.
/L		SUPPRESS OUTPUT OF SOURCE.
/M		SUPPRESS OUTPUT OF CREF OF MACROS.
/O		OUTPUT CREF OF OPERATORS.
/P		USE PAGE NUM. AND LINE NUM. WITHIN PAGE,
		  RATHER THAN LINE NUM. IN FILE.
/S		SUPPRESS OUTPUT OF CREF OF ORDINARY SY̧.
/V		FOLLOWED BY AN "L" FOR "LPT",
		AN "X" FOR "XGPKO A DECIMAL NUMBER AND A CfY
		SETS THE NUMBER OF LINES PER PAGE IN THE iAFILE.񢄉QTHIS uԇH SHOULD APPEAR WITH THE OUTPUT FIL)ЋC)

/-L		OUTPUT SOURCE.
ETC.
THE INITIAL DEFAULTS ARE /-L/-M/-O/-S
/-D IS THE SAME AS /D .


^U CANCELS AN ENTIRE COMMAND; RUBOUT, ONE CHAR.
^Q QUOTES CHARS IN ", ;:_/" IN FILENAMES.
^C TERMINATES THE COMMAND AS ^M DOES,
	AND CAUSES A .BREAK 16,140000 TO FOLLOW IT,
	THUS DELETING CREF AND RETURNING TO DDT
	WITHOUT FLUSHING THE TYPIN BUFFER.
	(UNLESS AN ERROR OCCURS, IN WHICH CASE
	THE TYPIN BUFFER WILL BE RESET,
	AND A NEW COMMAND STRING REQUESTED.)


CREF INPUT FORMATS:

 ASCII INPUT FORMAT (USUALLY INCLUDED IN LISTING):

TO INDICATE A USE OF A SYMBOL X, OUTPUT A FLAG CHAR, FOLLOWED BY X, FOLLOWED BY AN ^^ .
TO INDICATE A DEFINITION OF X, USE AN ALTMODE INSTEAD OF AN ^^ .

THE FLAG CHARACTERS ARE ALTMODE FOR AN OPERATOR,
  ^\ FOR A MACRO,
  ^^ FOR AN ORDINARY SYMBOL.

THE CHARACTER ^] SHOULD PRECEDE EVERY LINE WHICH IS TO BE
ASSIGNED A LINE NUMBER. OUTPUT FOR OCCURRENCES OF SYMBOLS
IN A LINE SHOULD PRECEDE THE ^] FOR THE LINE.

THE CHARACTER ^_ SEPARATES PARTS OF A FILE WHICH
SHOULD BE CREFFED SEPARATELY.

RUBOUTS AND ^@'S IN THE FILE MAY CAUSE TROUBLE.

 IMAGE INPUT FORMAT:
  (FORCES /P, AND EFFECTIVELY /L, SINCE
	THERE IS NO SOURCE IN THE CREF FILE)

THE FILE SHOULD START WITH A HEADER WORD CONTAINING
ASCII OF RUBOUT, B, AND ^W.

THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF ITEMS EXIST:

  SYMBOL OCCURRENCE - IDENTIFIED BY EXACTLY ONE OF BITS 4.6 - 4.8 ON.
	THIS ITEM IS ONE WORD CONTAINING THE SQUOZE FOR THE SYMBOL,
	AND THE FOLLOWING FLAGS:
	  4.9 - DEFINING OCCURRENCE.
	  4.8 - THIS WAS A PREDEFINED SYMBOL.
	  4.7 - THIS WAS A MACRO.
	  4.6 - THIS WAS A NORMAL SYMBOL (4.6, 4.7, 4.8 MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.)

 PAGE & LINE NUMBER SPECIFICATION -  4.6 - 4.9 ARE 0, BUT LH. NOT 0.
	THIS ITEM HOLDS THE PAGE NUMBER IN THE LH.
	AND THE LINE NUMBER IN THE RH.
	IT AFFECTS THE SYMBOL OCCURRENCE ITEMS WHICH
	FOLLOW IT AND PRECEDE THE NEXT PAGE & LINE NUMBER SPEC.

 SET SOURCE FILE BLOCK. - 1, FOLLOWED BY 4 WORDS
	WHICH CONTAIN THE LEFT-JUSTIFIED SIXBIT DEV, FN1, FN2, SNAME
	OF THE SOURCE FILE. THIS SETS PAGE NUMBER AND LINE NUMBER TO 0.

 PUSH SOURCE FILE BLOCK - LIKE SET SOURCE FILE, BUT STARTS WITH
	A 3 INSTEAD OF A 1. THIS CORRESPONDS TO A .INSRT IN THE
	SOURCE.

 POP SOURCE FILE - 2
	CORRESPONDS TO EOF IN A .INSRT FILE.

 EOF - 0
