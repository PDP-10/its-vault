TVWRIT [<file-name>][Tnm]		WRITES TV-SCREEN DIRECT (8. DSK-BLOCKS)

	Writes the named screen (or your own) to <file-name> as a
	standard image file.   quotes strange chars in filename.
	Default file-name is DSK:HSNAME;SCREEN >.

TVREAD [<file-name>][/n][Tnm]		READS TV-SCREEN DIRECT (8. DSK-BLOCKS)

	Default file-name is DSK:HSNAME;SCREEN >.
	Type SPACE to flush picture on your screen.
	Type CR to redisplay picture.
	Type RUBOUT to call ZAP to record in XGP format.
	In latter case, argument /n (1, 2 or 3) is passsed along to ZAP.

ZAP [<file-name>][/n][Tnm]		writes screen in XGP SCAN format.

	Default file-name is DSK:HSNAME;FRAME >.
	n should be 1, 2 or 3 - default is 1.
	n determines how much each point will be bloated up by.
	n also determines how big the file will be (11, 37 or 72 blocks)
	OUTPUT PRODUCED THIS WAY CAN BE OUTPUT ON XGP  -> ;SCAN COMMAND.

RECORD [<file-name>][Tnm]		Produces ASCII file of characters on screen.

	Default file-name is DSK:HSNAME;RECORD >.
	Interprets sail chars as control-characters,X as control-X
	and ^X as uparrow and X.  x is  plus x if x is not a capital
	letter (?,@,A-Z,[,\,],^,or _).
	If an ! appears in the rightmost column, it is deleted, and the
	two lines concatenated (the reverse of line continuation).
	Deals properly with minor bit errors - pepper-corn noise.

TVDRVR FASL:	USEFUL DISPLAY HACKS FOR LISP.

	clear		clears screen completely
	point (x,y)	plot point at x and y.
	line (x0,y0,x1,y1) plot vector from (x0,y0) to (x1,y1)
	circle(x,y,r)	plot circle, center (x,y), radius r

Coordinates run from lower left hand corner 0<x<576. and 0<y<455.

	----------------------------------------------------


TO USE TVWRIT, TVREAD AND ZAP FROM LISP: USE VALRET,  AND  or :VP.

For example:	(VALRET '/:bkph/;tvwrit/ uname/;foo/ bar/
		:VP/
		)

		will write the current screen-full out using TVWRIT 
		into file "foo bar", without disturbing the picture, 
		and return to LISP.

The recommended mode is to store screens using TVWRIT
and only ZAP them at the last moment using TVREAD and rubout. Do this just
before XGP'ing them by means of ;SCAN, to avoid tying up lots of disk-space.

NOTE:	While the tektronics hard-copy device (using <escape>Q) is
	geometrically fairly accurate, the XGP suffers from quite 
	a bit of pin-cushion distortion. That is, goodies near
	the center are compressed horizontally, while those near
	the edges are stretched out horizontally.
