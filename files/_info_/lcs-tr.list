 TR-262    ``High Level VAL  Constructs in  a Data  Flow Machine''  by
           Kenneth Wayne Todd, February 1981.
           The Dennis-Misunas Form  1 Data  Flow Machine  can best  be
           described as a static and scalar machine. Despite these two
           limiting characteristics it is still possible to  translate
           the whole of the  functional programming language VAL  into
           the base language of this machine. Methods for  translating
           the various  high level  construucts of  VAL are  presented
           which exploit the parallelism inherent in programs  written
           in VAL  mainly  by  pipeling through  s  dingle  expression
           (vertical parallelism) rather than employing many copies of
           that same expression (horizontal parallelism), although the
           latter is  not  ruled  out. These  methods  are  tested  by
           translating two different versions of a vector dot  product
           algorithm, and  the  results obtained  from  running  these
           translations on an interpreter are analyzed.

 TR-260    ``Nested Transactions: An Approach to Reliable  Distributed
           Computing'' by J. Eliot B. Moss (Ph.D. dissertation), April
           1981, $4.00.
           This report addresses the  issue of providing software  for
           reliable distributed systems. In particular, we examine how
           to program a system so that the software continues to  work
           in the  face of  a  variety of  failures  of parts  of  the
           system.  The   design  presented   uses  the   concept   of
           transactions: collections  of  primitive actions  that  are
           indivisible. The  indivisibility  of  transactions  insures
           that consistent results are obtained even when requests are
           processed concurrently or failures occur during a  request.
           Our design  permists  transactions  to  be  nested.  Nested
           transactions provide  nested universes  of  synchronization
           and  recovery  from  failures.  The  advantages  of  nested
           transactions over single-level  transactions are that  they
           provide  concurrency   control   within   transactions   by
           serializing subtransansactions appropriately, and they they
           permit parts of a  transaction to fail without  necessarily
           aborting   the   entire   transaction.   The   method   for
           implementing nested transactions  described in this  report
           is novel in that it  uses locking for concurrency  control.
           We present the necessary algorithms for locking,  recovery,
           distributed commitment, and distributed deadlock  detection
           for a nested transaction system.  While the design has  not
           been implemented, it has been simulated.
           
 TR-259    ``A Switch-Level  Simulation  Model  for  Integrated  Logic
           Circuits'' by Randal E. Bryant (Ph.D. dissertation),  March
           1981, $4.50.
           The switch-level model  describes the  logical behavior  of
           digital integrated  circuits  implemented  in  metal  oxide
           semiconductor (MOS)  technology. A  network in  this  model
           consists  of  a  set  of  nodes  connected  by   transistor
           "switches." Many aspects of  MOS circuits can be  described
           which cannot be expressed in the Boolean logic gate  model,
           such as  bidirectional pass  transistors, dynamic  storage,
           and charge sharing. Furthermore,  the logic network can  be
           extracted directly from the mask specification of a circuit
           by a  relatively straightforward  computer program.  Unlike
           analog circuit models, however, the nodes in a switch-level
           network assume  discrete  logic states  0,  1, and  X  (for
           unknown),  and  the  transistors  assume  discrete   states
           "open," "closed," and  "unknown." This model  can form  the
           basis  of  a   logic  simulator  for   MOS  circuits   with
           performance  comparable  to  logic  gate  simulators.  This
           dissertation  presents  a   rigorous  development  of   the
           switch-level model and several simulation algorithms.
           
 TR-258    ``A Design Methodology for Self-Timed Systems'' by Narinder
           P. Singh (S.M. thesis), February 1981, $3.00.
           This thesis presents  a design  methodology for  self-timed
           systems which will be extremely attractive for implementing
           systems in VLSI.  Self-timed systems  are characterized  by
           the absence of a timing  reference to which all  operations
           are synchronized. The methodology  proposed in this  thesis
           defines a set  of  modules which  form the building  blocks
           for  implementing  an  arbitrary  self-timed  system.   The
           various module  types  are based  on  familiar  programming
           constructs such as iterations, conditionals and  constructs
           that aid in the activation and synchronization of  parallel
           processes, such as, forking and  joining. The modules of  a
           self-timed  system  communicate  with  each  other  via  an
           asynchronous  communication  protocol,   and  the   correct
           behavior of the system is independent of  the delays in the
           communication  medium.  This  methodology  simplifies   the
           design effort by restricting  the timing constraints to  be
           local to the modules of the system.

           Synthesis'' by Carol A. Cesari (S.B./S.M. thesis), February
           1981, $3.50.
           This thesis presents a  proposed computer synthesis  system
           that  includes  a  data  flow  machine,  a  computer  whose
           architecture is  highly  parallel. The  Music-11  synthesis
           system at  MIT  was used  as  a  model in  its  design.  An
           analysis of the  algorithms used in  the sample  conversion
           process and how it  would run on the  data flow machine  is
           presented.  An  example  of  how  a  composition  would  be
           described in a synthesis language  and how it would run  on
           the proposed system is given.

           This paper discusses in detail  how an analyzed plan for  a
           COBOL program can be translated into a HIBOL program. It is
           currently possible to translate  into HIBOL analyzed  plans
           for a relatively small (but  well defined) subset of  COBOL
           programs. Suggestions are made as to how that subset  could
           be expanded through further research.

           whose basic purpose is to produce fundamental  improvements
           in  the   software    technology   relevant   to   business

           significantly expedited by the   further automation of  its
           part. We give a history of  applications systems technology
           and show how it can be  expected to evolve in the future.
           
 TR-253    ``An Integrated Approach to Formatted Document Production''
           by  R. Ilson (S.M. Thesis), February 1981, $2.00.
           Recent advances  in printing  technology have  reduced  the
           cost  of  typeset  quality  printers.  Unfortunately,   the
           production of  attractively  formatted  documents  requires
           typographic skill  and special  training on  computer-based
           text processing systems. In response to this situation,  we
           have  developed  the  Etude  text  processing  system.  The
           principal characteristics  of Etude  are that  it  embodies
           substantial typographic expertise, and is based on concepts
           familiar to untrained users. Furthermore, Etude provides  a
           real-time display  facility  that  allows  the  results  of
           editing and formatting operations  to be seen  immediately.
           Thus,  Etude  supports  the  entire  process  of  producing
           decorously formatted documents.

           The notion of  the data  driven loop  arises in  connection
           with our work in the Very High Level Language HIBOL and the
           automatic programming system (ProtoSystem I) that  supports
           it. Although the concept is of general interest outside  of
           VHLL's and automatic programming, we find it profitable  to
           use HIBOL as a  vechile for our discussion  and a means  of
           narrowing the scope of our discussion. Therefore, we  first
           present a  brief  description  of the  domain  which  HIBOL
           treats.

           Current methods of designing VLSI chips do not insure  that
           the chips will perform correctly when manufactured. Because
           the turnaround time on chip  fabrication varies from a  few
           weeks to a few months, a scheme other than "try it and  see
           if  it  works"  is  needed.  Checking  of  chips  by   hand
           simulation and  visual inspection  of checkplots  will  not

           essential features of CLU, and discuss how CLU differs from
           other, more conventional, languages. Sections 5 through  13
           form the reference manual  proper. These sections  describe
           each aspect of CLU in detail, and discuss the proper use of
           various features. Appendices 1 through III provide  concise
           summaries of CLU's syntax, data types, and I/O  facilities.
           Appendix IV contains example programs.

           This thesis explores the problems of data model equivalence

           formal approach is followed. Two semantic data models,  the
           semantic relation data  model and the  semantic graph  data
           model, are defined and proved equivalent.

           In this dissertation, a new approach to the synchronization
           of accesses to  shared data  objects is  developed. In  the
           system developed  here,  called NAMOS,  versions  have  two
           component names consisting of the  name of an object and  a
           pseudo-time, the  name of  the system  state to  which  the
           version  belongs.  By  giving  programs  control  over  the
           pseudo-time in which an access is made, synchronization  of
           accesses to multiple objects is simplified.

           This thesis examines the various mechanisms for naming  the
           information objects stored  in a general-purpose  computing
           utility and isolated a basic set of naming facilities  that
           must be  protected to  assure  complete control  over  user

           The thesis of this dissertation is that an understanding of
           the ordering constraints that  are introduced among  events
           of parallel process  is essential to  the understanding  of
           synchronization  and  that   therefore  any  language   for
           specifying synchronization  of parallel  process should  be
           based on a theory of such orderings.
