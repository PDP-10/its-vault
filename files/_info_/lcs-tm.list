 TM-198    ``The  Propositional   Dynamic  Logic   of   Deterministic,
           Well-Structured Programs'' by J.Y.  Halpern and J.H.  Reif,
           March 1981.
           We  consider  a  restricted  propositional  dynamic  logic,
           Strict Deterministic Propositional  Dynamic Logic  (SDPDL),
           which is  appropriate  for  reasoning  about  deterministic
           well-structured programs. In contrast to PDL, for which the
           validity problem is known  to be complete in  deterministic
           exponential time, the validity  problem for SDPDL is  shown
           to be polynomial space complete. We also show that SDPDL is
           less expensive  than PDL.  The  results rely  on  structure
           theorems for models of satisfiable SDPDL formulas, and  the
           proofs give insight into  the effects of nondeterminism  on
           intractability and expressiveness in program logics.
           
 TM-197    ``Conservative Logic'' by  E. Fredkin and  T. Toffoli,  May
           1981, AD A101 383.
           Conservative logic is a comprehensive model of  computation
           which  explicitly   reflects   a  number   of   fundamental
           principles of  physics, such  as the  reversibility of  the
           dynamical laws  and the  conservation of  certain  additive
           quantities. Because of its closer adherence to physics than
           found in  traditional models  of computation,  conservative
           logic is  in  a  better  position  to  provide  indications
           concerning the realizations  of high performance  computing
           systems, i.e., of systems that  make very efficient use  of
           the "computing resources"  actually offered  by nature.  In
           particular, conservative  logic shows  that it  is  ideally
           possible to build  sequential circuits  with zero  internal
           power dissipation.

           This  thesis  deals  with  the  structural  complexity   of
           switching  networks   which   realize   concentration   and
           connection requests  when operated  in a  rearrangeable  or
           incremental manner.  Some  of  the  important  results  and
           constructions are briefly reviewed.

           issues system  designers were concerned with in  developing
           next generation office  systems.  The  workshop involved  a
           cross-section  of  people  from  government,  industry  and
           academia. Presentations  in the  form  of talks  and  video
           tapes were made of prototypical systems.

           In a persistent  vector replacement system  (VRS) or  Petri
           net, an  enabled transition  can  become disabled  only  by
           firing itself. Here, an algorithm is presented which allows
           to decide whether  an arbitrary VRS  is persistent or  not,
           and if so, to construct a semilinear representation of  the
           set of states reachable in the system.

           BRAND X is a simple representation language implemented  as
           a pure extension  of LISP. BRAND  X provides the  following
           additional  facilities  over  LISP:  Unique  and  canonical
           structures, property lists for all objects, labels for  all
           objects, and a syntax to  express each of these,  supported
           by a  reader  and  printer.  BRAND  X  is  intended  as  an
           "assembly   language"    for   representation    languages,
           attempting to provide facilities generally found useful  in
           the simplest  manner,  without  any  strong  commitment  to
           specific representational conventions.

           A grid  path  is  a node-induced  finite  subgraph  of  the
           infinite grid. It is rectangular if its set of nodes is the
           product of two  intervals. Given a  rectangular grid  graph
           and two  of its  nodes, we  give necessary  and  sufficient
           conditions for the  graph to have  a Hamilton path  between
           these two  nodes.  In  contrast,  the  Hamilton  path  (and
           circuit) problem for  general grid  graphs is  shown to  be
           NP-complete. This provides a new, relatively simple,  proof
           of the result that the Euclidean traveling salesman problem
           is NP-complete.

           Mechanism for Distributed  Systems'' by  M.K. Sinha,  Sept.
           1980.
           A new  mechanism for  the  synchronisation of  accesses  to
           distributed data  objects  is  developed.  This  mechanism,
           called  timepad,   is  an   extension  to   the   timestamp
           synchronisation scheme  and  it  encaches  the  concurrency
           transparency requirement of the user reducing the chance of
           eventual rejection  of a  transaction. The  timepad  scheme
           will improve the performance of those distributed  database
           systems where the probability  of transactions clashing  is
           high. We also discuss how the timepad mechanism can be used
           as an  approximation  pad  to  solve  problems  which  need
           approximate solution.

           It is  well known  that regular  languages satisfy  certain
           conditions known as pumping  lemmas or iteration  theorems.
           However, the question of the converse result has been open.
           We show that the usual form of the pumping lemma falls very
           far short of implying regularity, but that there is a form,
           which we have  called the block  pumping property, that  is
           equivalent to regularity.

           case performance of critical path scheduling is given. This
           bound depends both on the  number of processors and on  the

           defined class)  of  models  of  the  Segerberg  axioms  for
           propositional  dynamic  logic.  We  obtain  the   following
           results (to  within  inseparability). (i)  In  any  dynamic
           algebra * is reflexive transitive closure. (ii) Every  free
           dynamic  algebra  can  be  factored  into  finite   dynamic
           algebras. (iii) Every finite dynamic algebra is  isomorphic
           to a  Kripke  structure.  (ii)  and  (iii)  imply  Parikh"s
           completeness theorem  for  the Segerberg  axioms.  We  also
           present an  approach to  treating the  inductive aspect  of
           recursion within dynamic algebras.

           This thesis attempts to alleviate some of the confusion  by
           giving precise definitions  of two  varieties of  semaphore
           primitives; here called weak and blocked-set primitives. It
           is  then  shown  that  under  certain  natural  conditions,
           although it is possible to implement starvation-free mutual
           exclusion with blocked-set semaphores,  it is not  possible
           to do so  with weak  semaphores. Thus  weak semaphores  are
           strictly less "powerful" than blocked-set semaphores.

           We show that "looping"  of while-programs can be  expressed
           in  Regular  First  Order   Dynamic  Logic,  disproving   a
           conjecture made by  Harel and  Pratt. In  addition we  show
           that the expressive power of quantifier-free Dynamic  Logic
           increases when nondeterminism is introduced in the programs
           that are  part  of  formulae  of  Dynamic  Logic.  Allowing
           assignments of random  values to  variables also  increases
           expressive power.

           We give a simple proof  that integer programming is in  NP.
           Our proof also establishes that there is a pseudopolynomial
           time algorithm  for integer  programming with  any  (fixed)
           number of constraints.

           A new proof of a theorem  of Hopcroft, Paul and Valiant  is
           presented: every deterministic multitape Turing machine  of
           time complexity T(n)  can be simulated  by a  deterministic
           Turing machine of space complexity T(n)/log T(n). The proof

           In the standard pebble game the number of pebbles  required
           to pebble  the root  of  a tree  can  be computed  in  time
           linearly proportional  to  the  number of  nodes.  For  the
           black/white pebble game the number of pebbles necessary  to
           pebble root of a complete tree is derived.

           Is it possible to  play a fair game  of "Mental Poker?"  We
           will give   a complete  (but  paradoxical) answer  to  this
           question.   We  will  first  prove  that  the  problem   is
           intrinsically insoluble,  and then  describe a fair  method
           of playing "Mental Poker."

           invertible combinatorial function. Interpreted in  physical
