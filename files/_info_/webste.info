Webster is used to look up words in the online Webster's 7th dictionary.
To look up a single word, supply it as an argument, e.g.

	@WEBSTER word-to-define

If you want to look up more than one word, just do

	@WEBSTER<return>

and you will be prompted with

	Word:

Type the word, or hit <return> to exit.

If the word is found, Webster will then provide the complete dictionary
entry for the word including definitions, pronunciation, and derivation.

If the specified word was not found, Webster will try to find close
matches, as if you spelled the word wrong.  The possibilities are
numbered and typed out.  To select one of them, you can just give its
number.

Additionally, Webster can match words using wildcards.  The character
"%" in a word mean match exactly one character, so "w%n" matches "win",
"won", "wan", etc.  The character "*" matches ZERO OR MORE characters,
so "a*d" matches "ad", "and", "abound", "absentminded", and so on.
Any number of wildcards can be used, and in any arrangement.

<escape> and "?" are used the same way in Webster as in most programs.
<escape> tries to complete what you have typed so far, and "?" lists
those words that match your partial word.

If what you have given is a unique abbreviation for a word, <escape>
will typed out the rest of the word.  If what you typed is ambigious,
it beeps and does nothing.

For example,

Word: plur? Maybe you mean:
      -----
  1. plural           2. pluralism        3. plurality        4. pluralization
  5. pluralize        6. pluri-           7. pluriaxial
Word: pluri? Maybe you mean:
      ------
  1. pluri-           2. pluriaxial
Word: pluria<escape>xial
      --------------

Where the underlined parts are typed by the user, and rest by Webster.
Note that wildcards and <escape>/? can be used together, for example

Word: plu*x<escape>
      -------------
Word: pluriaxial
