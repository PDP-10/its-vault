This is the documentation for the LISP teacher program.

It is basically an ordinary LISP, except it provides a few extra
facilities to aid the novice user, and to record what the user
does, so I can study it to make the program better.

The first basic command the user should be familiar with is the
HELP command.  Simply typing

HELP

will generally try to find someone on the system who can help
you.  Note that this command is not recognized if you are in the
middle of typing something else in; you should type ^G
(control-G) first to flush any pending input.  When it finds
someone to help you, it will tell you something like:

RWK sent a response to your request for help,
and should be contacting you shortly.

Another facility which :TEACH;LISP provides is the ability to
save your environment.  When someone is working on a real LISP
program, one normally does not wish to preserve one's LISP
environment, since one has the source file that created it, and
can simply edit that to make any changes.  Thus, there is
normally no concept like that of a "workspace".  However, in the
tutorial mode, it makes a little more sense, particularly with
people who are not familiar with any of the ITS editors.  Thus,
the functions (SAVE) and (UNSAVE) have been provided, which try
to save all your environment.  Each person has his own
environment, but only has one.  Both function definitions and
values of symbols will be saved.

Another facility provided is documentation on LISP.  For more
info on this, do (APROPOS) and (DESCRIBE).
