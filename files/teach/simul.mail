I am in the process of doing a shitload of stuff to SYSTEM, with an eye
to making it a show-case for some of the CLASS ideas which will be used in
NIL.  SYSTEM is likely to be broken for a while, and in addition, when
it is feeling better, it will be quite incompatible.  OSYS will remain
the compatible version.

NEAL/KGK:  I'd love to give you a demo of this stuff as soon as I get it
done.  Should be tomorrow sometime.

To: SIMUL at MIT-MC

The following files have been released to the TEACH direcotry:

HANDLE 1
WIRE 1


TEACH;WIRE 1 contains all the functions and definitions nessesary to create wires, devices, 
a NULLQ and a premade function entity for a two input nand gate.  Function entities are really part
of a master entity.  Function entities are specific to a peticular type of gate, masters
are general and together they form a device.  A NULLQ is a temporary hack to partially simulate
the queuer KGK is in the process of writing.  In the file HANDLE, various handlers
exist for the entities created in WIRE.  Sub-functions are also found there.  
The system has been checked out.  Any bugs found should be mailed to
NEAL.                         --Neal

I have successfully completed a generalized error handler for
SIMUL.  It may be worth-while implementing in the rest of
simul.    The file it lives in is called RAF;HANDLE > and the top-level
function is called ERR-HANDLE.  Essentially it combines FORMAT with LISP's
ERROR function in such a way that any number of datum may be included
in the error message.  
Any comments or suggestions would be apreciated.  --Neal

A fixed-up version of DIDL is now included in SYSTEM.
Among other things, it eliminates the problems with the screen staying
split after exiting.

Also included is the WOPS function
(WOPS <sfa or entity>)
prints a nice table of operations that that SFA or ENTITY knows about.

The function UNKNOWN-OP is a macro taking 3 or 5 arguments.  It should be used
as the T clause of the main CASEQ in ENTITY and SFA handlers, to report
that the SFA or ENTITY was given an operation that it didn't understand.

It takes the same arguments, in the same order, as the SFA or ENTITY handler
takes arguments.  I.e. if you have
(DEFUN FOO-HANDLER (SELF OP DAT1 DAT2 DAT3)
  (CASEQ op
	 (WHICH-OPERATIONS '())
	 (T (UNKNOWN-OP SELF OP DAT1 DAT2 DAT3))))
or
(DEFUN FOO-SFA (SELF OP DATA)
  (CASEQ OP
	 (WHICH-OPERATIONS '(TYO))
	 (TYO NIL) ; don't really do anything
	 (T (UNKNOWN-OP SELF OP DATA))))

It will print an error message, in english, of what operation on what
SFA or ENTITY, and what arguments were passed.  It will then signal a
wrong-type-arguments error.

This belongs in just about every handler.

:TEACH;SYSTEM
will give you a LISP that has the ENTITY and STRUCT stuff already set up.
This includes a new, improved structure and entity printer that should
print everything nicely.  To create output files that print nicely,
do use CREATE-STRUCT-FILE instead of OPEN.

Addendum:  I forgot to mention that the mechanism that ENTITY's use to
handle printing nicely is extendable to structures as well.  If you have
DTP-FROBULE, you can do
(DEFUN (DTP-FROBULE PNAME-FINDER) (OBJECT)
 ....)
where OBJECT will be the specific instance of the structure.  It should
return the item to go into the xxxx in <DTP-FROBULE xxxx>

To: SIMUL at MIT-MC

ENTITY's now can have a PNAME? operation, which should return something
to fit in the xxxx in <#DTP-ENTITY xxxx>.  If there is no such operation,
it will use the PNAME property instead.  If there is no PNAME operation,
it will use the name of the handler followed by ! followed by nnn where nnn
is a unique number.  I.e.
#<DTP-ENTITY FROB-HANDLER!523413>

The STRUCTURE printer is now more winning.  Any oddities, please let me know.
To make LISP use the STRUCTURE printer, say
(SETQ PRIN1 'STRUCT-PRIN1)
You can give individual STRUCT's a name of their own by doing
(PUTPROP struct name 'PNAME)

has been fixed and is now compiled.

It certainly couldn't hurt for you and KGK to show up for KEN's talk this
afternoon.  It might or might not be relavant, but it should be interesting
and educational, in any event.

Perhaps it would be advisable for us to show up for this message 
passing frob that CARL@AI is talking about, schedualed for monday.
Sounds like it directly ties in with the logic sim,ulator work.
