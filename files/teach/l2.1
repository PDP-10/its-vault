Among the neater features of this version is the funcion FILE.  to load in
a file, say (FILE FOO).  this will read in a function <name> FOO from my
directory (where you should keep your LISP files) where <name> is the
name you log in as..  Please do not put things other than your LISP files on
my directory, as my directory is already rather full.  Do not delete them when
you are through--just send me mail telling me, and I will delete them after I
have finish checking them out.  If you want to keep them, you should copy them
elsewhere, or have me retrieve them--everything will be moved to a safe place
before deleting, and sometimes they may disapear before you are ready for them
to.
