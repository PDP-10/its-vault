 Presumably the
first N-1 forms if they exist are done for side-effect. For example,
the LAMBDA operator

	(LAMBDA (X Y) (+ X Y) (* X Y))

would compute the sum of X and Y, then throw away its value -- essentially
wasting your work computing it. Then it would compute the product of X and
Y and since that is the last form in the list, would return that value.
So we see that the operator

	(LAMBDA (X Y) (+ X Y) (* X Y))

is functionally equivalent to the operator

	(LAMBDA (X Y) (* X Y))
