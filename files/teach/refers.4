Re: Bibliography
--Text follows this line--
The following are references that come to mind offhand on the subject of 
Lisp with which I have had first-hand experience and my impressions of each.
(There are other references of which I have heard but that I have no way 
to comment so I will omit for now.) I hope you'll find this useful. -kmp

John R. Allen: ``Anatomy of Lisp,''
  McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1978.

	This is a not-unrespectable survey of Lisp issues, but to read
	it requires considerable sophistication in computer languages.
	Not for average consumption. Some of the things it seems to assume
	about the reader's background make one wonder why other parts of
	the text were included (like a second-year calculus text that begins
	with a review of high-school algebra -- only the beginner-level stuff
	is sort of mixed in throughout with the high-level stuff). It also
	uses meta-notation for lisp, where you say script-t for T, script-f
	for NIL, concat for CONS, [...; ...; ...;] for a COND form, etc.
	That notation is not implemented anywhere has no useful purpose in
	my opinion.

Bernard Greenberg: ``Notes on the Programming Language Lisp,''
  Student Information Processing Board, MIT, 1978.

	This is a not-really-professional quality but recommended work
	for beginners. It takes what I and many others advocate as the 
	correct (strongly object-oriented) approach to what Lisp is all
	about. Just notes -- not a book, but takes one through a complete
	buildup. It also has the advantage of being explicitly about Maclisp.
	Despite its crude form, probably the best teaching text around.

John McCarthy: ``Lisp 1.5 Programmer's Manual,''
  MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, August, 1962

	Obsolete. Most of the constructs described are out of date in one
	way or another. Useful to provide historical insight; interesting
	reading if you're a Lisp fanatic; but not really practical for anything
	else.

David A. Moon: ``Maclisp Reference Manual,''
  Laboratory for Computer Science, MIT, March 1974.

	Not organized in teaching form but useful from the point of view 
	that it offers about all the documentation you're likely to find
	about Maclisp in so small a space.

Laurent Siklossy: ``Let's Talk Lisp,''
  Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 1976.

	Not really recommended. The programming techniques taught are
        primitive and outmoded. The lisp referred to is pretty old.
	It uses EVALQUOTE notation all over the place which I don't think
	is a good formalism. It makes some attempt to distinguish between
	things that are likely to vary from system to system and things
	that are pretty standard. Indentation style is lousy. Treatment
	of newly evolving issues in macros, fexprs are poor to non-existent.

Guy L. Steele, Jr. and Gerald J. Sussman:
	``The Revised Report on SCHEME, A Dialect of Lisp,''
  AI Memo 452, Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, MIT, January 1978.

	Recommended not for beginning programmers but for those having
	pretty much mastered most of the major aspects and looking for
	breadth. Scheme is quite a bit separated from `normal' Lisp dialects
	but is interesting in its own right. A number of other papers on
	Lisp- and Scheme-related topics have been published by Sussman/Steele 
	as well, also as AI Memos.

Warren Teitelman: ``Interlisp Reference Manual,''
  Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, October 1978.

	Amazingly detailed report on an amazingly hairy language. I 
	question whether the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink aspect of
	InterLisp is really the right way to go, but for those interested
	in Interlisp, this manual has quite a bit of detail. The manual
	explicitly states that it is not an introduction to Lisp, but rather
	a reference manual.

Daniel Weinreb and David Moon: ``Lisp Machine Manual,''
  Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, MIT, January 1979.

	A useful but becoming-more-and-more-incomplete-all-the-time
	description of Lisp Machine lisp. Much of the information in this
	manual also applies to some of the undocumented features of Maclisp,
	though it doesn't always say so where that is true, so it isn't 
	as useful in that respect as it could be (that, of course, was not
	the authors' purpose). Fairly interesting also as a survey of what
	new things are available in state-of-the-art Lisp systems.

Jon L. White: ``NIL---A Perspective'',
  1979 Macsyma Users' Conference Proceedings; Washington, DC; June 20-22, 1979

	The only existing paper on the language NIL, a direct Maclisp 
        descendant intended to replace Maclisp on the Vax. Other documentation
        is available online on MC and will hopefully become a manual within
        time, but that is likely to be away off yet. This paper is a brief
        overview of proposed plans for NIL that make it distinct from Maclisp,
	but doesn't really go into much detail.

Patrick Winston and Berthold K. P. Horn: ``LISP,'' Draft #3
  Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, MIT, unpublished, 1979.

	This book is intended as a Lisp manual for beginning Lisp students on
	the college level with AI applications. The presentation which brings
	one from the 0-level to the level of programming I think is a little
	steep; and the presentation is about as far from the Greenberg
	approach as one can get -- being more abstract than it should be and
	not presenting uniqueness of identity and other useful issues in the
	way that Greenberg does (which I have said I prefer). The main
	redeeming feature of the book is its copious display of non-trivial
	applications in interesting domains. The coding style in the examples
	is primitive and not really exemplary of modern coding style, but
	that may improve in subsequent drafts as there has been some feedback 
	received by Winston/Horn on these issues to which they have been 
	responsive.
