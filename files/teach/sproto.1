rhaps it would go something lik!
e this:
Loop over all 20 items adding each item to the list.

level 2: To add an item to the list, search down the ALIDS  ST....etc...
ok, now, questions?
S:Yes, who in heavens name is in this 5 ways/// 4 way/// 5 way link?
There is Me, Rwk, Hic, Hic0 and T45... But I think I understand what
you just said...
>H:ok, there is myself (hic), stever, rwk, a pty with a wallpaper file, and
a decwriter in on this.
s:but I thought that you couldn't wall paper a link... (or rwk gave
me some exlanation of why you can not once)

R: What I have going is a PTY which is remembering all the 8-buit ///bit
codes ITS is sending it.  I have a program which can interpret this
back again.....it's al  inda odd.  But back to the discussion....

The idea (RWK still) here is that a representation.....//////
cancel, a specific data structure has associated with it a set of algorithms, I!
.e. abst/////operations on that data structurethat are somehow meaningful.    (just a sec)  Clearly an algorithm
which added a randomly chosen number to each item in the table
of inventory itmes would not be at all meaningful!   But if
that were a table with some other meaning, say in a monte-carlo 
simulation, it might be a meaningful opert/ation.    But then you
can operate on a different level, and make use of these basic
operations (the ones deemed useful, like adding a number to a specifi
ai///item) to do something useful.  Like, if we use the ALIST
representation:
In LISP, we have the primitive data-type LIST.,... Lets say CONS,
which has the operations CAR and CDR and RPLACD and we can 
take the ALIST and get a CONS by doing ASSQ, I.e.
(ASSQ 'FUES inventory-list)
and we can do ///set FOo the///to that result and do
(RPLACD FOO (+ 100 (CDR FOO)))
.... This correspons/ds to something meaningfull...I.e. we just
got a shipment of fuses.  ?
(S) Ok, I know what assoc does but what does assq do? I assume
it returns a list of some sort, maybe list///like assoc or something?
>Exactly like ASSOC, except it uses  EQ instead of EQUALS for
the test.  You may pretend I used ASSOC for now, ok?

ok...
OK.  Now we have roughly defined an operaton on our INVENTORY-LIST
data structure, using a lower level of abstraction (actually TWO of them,
the CONS and the alist...) and we can use it to define an algorithm
on even a higher levl, say we have another data structure
wich looks like an inventory, but //(i.e. it shares the
same representation and operations), but has the meaning of "SHIPPING PAPERS"
i.e. it is an ALIST of items recieved and how many are in the shipment.
With the ALIST operations and the add-to-tiem operation, we could
easily figure out the algorithm (or rather any of several algorithms) to
add this shipment to our inventory!  This isn't a program,
a program is a representation for an algorithm and it's data structures,
possibly spaning several levl///levles.  We're talking abstractly
here, before a translation to a specification language, like LISP or
ASSEMBLER or whatever.

S:No comment, I am rather surprised how clear this seems to be (now)

h: GOOD!  (I hope what you think we said is what we think we said....)
But,. I think we are really winning....ok, now, I think we should discuss the
other question that RWK asked at the beginning....Why data structures?
Why a particular structure rather than another one?
>S:Because, as he said, an algorithm built for one type of structure
will not work (correctly) on another type of c/structure.
>Um...ok, well, why is it important at all to discuss it....that seemsto be clear...things written for numbers can't work on letters, right...
but why ex
>(S) who is now typing?
>H: sorry, I am....but why explain things in terms of them
explicitly...what is the importance...do you have any ideas?
S:thinking...importance of what specifically?
H:OK, I think I better explain some more....perhaps you don;t see what I'm
getting at ... OK, well, we can simply say that the algorithm has to work
with the data we have....we have names and numbers, so we say to our programmer!
:
Ok, we have names and numbers,
go write some code to do this and do that eetc....
No thought as to whether to use an ALIST or arrays or anything like that....
do you have any ideas as to why such considerations are important?
S:I would say for the easiest way of getting at the data (probably
depending on the language).
H:Hmmm...yes, the particular language is important at some lower level,
also, at a higher level:
We want to be able to understand what is going on.  We don;t weant to sho   chose
a data-structure that obscures the meaning behind the thing we are repesenting.
ALISTs are good to use with the inventory frob..why>/ ?? well, because they
maintain the association between the names of the objects and the quantity...th!
ey are inseperably tied together by the DATA STRUCTURE....ok so far?
Any comments or additions?S:none by m3/e...
R:?Hmm.  OK, well, I'd like to hit at this from the other side, for balance.
When Howard said "why is ///are such considerations important?" (as to
whether to use an ALIST or ARRAYS), he let ///led you to look at some
important points about data structures.  Now, let me present a situation.
Somebody says, "W//OK, we have names and numbers, go write some code to
do this and do that, etc.".  But he doesn't specify the data structure.
H//Note that he didn't HAVE to specify the data structure for you to understand
what it was that he wanted.  Clearly at some point you have to deal with
the data in some data structure, but we appear to be free to deal with it
in whatever structure we chose.  So he was talking about algorithms at a 
higher level of meaning, and leaving the "implementational details" to us,
as a black box.  Thus, data structures allow us to deal with things in
large pice//pieces, he told us what was wanted without giving us
a 20 page program!  But at some point that program must be written,
but nobody can undert/stand a 20 b/page program!  T//Not at //all at one
time, that is.  But if the program is structure, /d in such a way
that you can deal with large pieces as aw//a whole, and then ///the
whole is of a simple enough form, then us mere humans can deal with it.
and the pices //pieces may then be split up, and again, we can deal with
them.  The way I just described is refered to as "top-down", as in
top down design, etc.  There is also botom up, which is essentially
the same idea, I.e. you deal with pices//pieces of a complexity you
can handle, and don't look at the inards of things you aren't working with.Hence, we don't re-wro/ite our little ADD-TO-INVENTORY proceedure
ever /y time we need it, it is a black box.  (as)>dis//digesting...OK, well
note that when///tour ADD-TO-INVENTORY proceedure is really a part of
our INE////INVENTORY abstraction, and as such, it isn't very complex.
It essentially has one operation and one data-type, wi//.... Thep///
The pieces are themselves also very simple.  Just a couple of operations
(CAR, CDR, ASSOC, RPLACD), (and +), and a single data/////3 data-types,
symbols, numbers, and CONS's.  We have creates/d something that is SIMPLER
than what we started out with, an//ina very real sense!

Got it!

(ok, pause for HIC to catch up)

(p oh, where is he? Wha//where WAS he?)
>Talking to BKERNS.  (he jusyt wandard away...he's back.) OK, I think
we've about covered it.  I think the way to go is to //for you to
give us any questions you have, and we will try to cons up some
homework for you and then we can talk about future agenda, ok?

Ok... Sonds good... I have no real questions however.
>Well, we aren't ready yet, so I'd recomend that you try to come up with
3 questions.  I'm sure you can come up with some, perhaps on the
fringes of what we have been talking about, perhaps a little specualtion?
thing///thinking...hmm, I honestly can't think of anything right now.
Do you know about complex numbers/ ?

Yes, I do... I think, those are the numbers dealing with i?
>Yes.  Do you know how to add, subtract, multiply, divide them?

No, all I know is what they are. I've never worked with them at all.
>OK, well, we'll have to come up with another idea...HIC just did.
Fractions.  You know about them!  Yes! OK, so what we'll do is give
you a little homework problem involving adding, subtracting, dividing, multiply!
ing
fractions, ok?  We're still working out the details of what the assignment is,
but does that sound like something that you could handle if it were a little
more specific?

T

hello?
>OK.  What we have decided on, is a trivial fraction-calculator.
I'll give you the over-all goal first, so you s/have an idea what the whole
think/g is for.  The final program (actually there will be 3 of them, for
3 different kinds of data-structures) will read the name//////will
read (via (READ) ), 2 of your data-stur/ctures and then the name ofan operation, ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE, and EXPONENTIATE.
It will then perform these operations on them and print the result.
This is just the final goal, not the assignment, ok?

ok... V/
