	EINE Documentation.		-*-Fundamental-*-

  EINE is the text editor for the Lisp Machine.  This document
attempts to document how to use EINE.  Since it is extremely similar
to EMACS for which good documentation already exists, and since most
EINE users are primarily EMACS users, this document assumes knowledge
of EMACS commands. 
  EINE tries to stay compatible on EMACS in most of the single
keystroke commands.  The main differences are in the interface to the
file system, the interface to Lisp, and the way multiple buffers are
used. 

  Buffers:  Text is stored in buffers.  When editing Lisp code you
generally keep one Lisp function in each buffer; this is discussed in
greater detail below.  At any time there is one current buffer which
you are editing; this is called the "open buffer". 

  Windows:  A window is a facility for looking at buffers.  Each
window has an area on the screen, and is rectangular.  They are
outlined for visual clarity.  There are various commands for changing
which windows are on the screen and what they look like.  Every window
on the screen refers to some buffer, part of which it displays.  There
are commands to change which buffer any window refers to.  If there
are two windows on the screen which refer to the same buffer and that
buffer is changed, the changes will be reflected in both windows (if
they are both displaying that  part of the buffer). 

  Layout of the screen:
Type (ED) to get into the editor.  The big rectangle starting at the top of
the screen is the main window; it is the only window on the screen.  Right below
that is one line called the status line.  It tells you what mode you are in,
the name of the current buffer, and sometimes other stuff.
  The next three lines are both the "echo area" and the "mini-buffer area".
Some commands echo stuff you type at them in the "echo area".  But other commands
make a small window appear there. (Type Control-X, and it will prompt you for 
a character in the echo area.  Type a Control-R, and you will see a small window
appear, with a prompt string in the status line.  (Now type Control-G to quit out!))
  When you are typing in the mini-buffer, you can use all editor commands,
so you get super-glorified rubout processing.  The only commands which don't
give you the minibuffer are those which use COMPLETING-READ; sometime
completion will be put together with the minibuffer.

  Extended commands:
Extended commands correspond to the MM commands in EMACS.  To invoke an
extended command, type Meta-X.  This puts you into COMPLETING-READ on the
list of extended commands. (COMPLETING-READ has not been documented yet, 
so here is a short blurb:  it is like command completion in TENEX and TWENEX.
You type some of the name, and then typing an altmode will fill in as many
characters as are logically implied by what you have typed and what is
on the list.  Typing a CR completes and terminates.  Space and - try to complete
to the next space and next - respectively.  Rubout and Control-Q work.)
The command will then prompt you.  Some commands it will make the mini buffer appear,
in order to take an argument.  You just type it in and end with a RETURN, and
as you are typing it in most editor commands are availible.


  The "Region":
As in EMACS, the place where you are working in the buffer is called
the "point".  However, the "mark" works slightly differently in EINE. 
In any buffer the mark may either be "on" or "off".  Usually it is
"off"; when it is on, the text between point and mark (which is called
the region, as in EMACS) is underlined.  When the mark is off,
commands which "do something having to do with the region" will not
work.  (This is to save you from accidentally text-justifying your
Lisp programs, and also to get rid of the distracting underline.) 
Those commands which "set the mark" in EMACS do the same thing in
EINE, but also turn the mark on.  Commands which don't modify text
(for example moving around in the buffer, and redisplay commands) will
leave the mark on.  Commands which modify the text in the buffer will
turn the mark off, if it was on.  (There are some exceptions, such as
"^R Uppercase Region", on the grounds that you might want to do other
stuff to the region.)  If this sounds like a screw, it isn't, try it
and see. 

  Getting into EINE:
 To enter EINE one usually calls the function ED.  ED takes one optional
argument, and sets up the open buffer depending on it.  Then it puts
you into EINE.

(ED) or (ED NIL) will just enter the editor.  The open buffer will be
whatever it was the last time the editor was used.
(ED T) will create a fresh buffer with a created name (like BUFFER-4).
(ED 'FOO) tries hard to edit the definition of the FOO function.
If there was a buffer named FOO already, it selects it.
If FOO was known in some TAG table read in, then it will read
it in from that file.
If FOO is defined as an interpreted function (or if it was compiled
on the Lisp machine and the compiler saved the interpreted function)
then that function is GRINDEFed into a new buffer called FOO.
If FOO is not defined but has a value, it will edit that in a buffer called
FOO-VALUE.
Otherwise it will create a buffer called FOO and put in
"(DEFUN FOO (" so that you can type in the definition.

If you call ED on a list, it will GRINDEF that list into a new buffer.
If you call ED on a buffer it will edit that buffer.

Another function to get into the editor is EDPROP, which takes its arguments
like GET: a symbol and a name of a property.  (EDPROP 'FOO 'BAR) will
create a buffer called FOO-BAR-PROPERTY and GRINDEF a PUTPROP form into
the buffer with the current value of (GET 'FOO 'BAR).  (If there is already
such a buffer it just selects it.)

  Commands to interface to Lisp:
Control-Meta-Z evaluates the forms in the buffer, prints the results,
and returns to Lisp.
Meta-Z compiles the contents of the buffer, and returns to Lisp.
EVALUATE BUFFER is like Control-Meta-Z but does not exit from EINE.
COMPILE BUFFER (that is an extended command) is like Meta-Z but does not
exit from EINE.
EVALUATE REGION is like EVALUATE BUFFER for the region (between point
and mark).
COMPILE REGION is like COMPILE BUFFER for the region.




  To visit the definition of a function, issue the extended command
"EDIT DEFINITION".  This command will read the name of the function to
be edited by means of the minibuffer.  If the function is already
known to EINE, the buffer already containing it will be reselected
instantly.  If EINE knows which file that function is in (for example,
if you read in a Tag table which contained that function) then it will
use that as the file name. 
	Otherwise, you will be asked with the minibuffer for the name
of the file to find the definition in.  On receiving the filename,
which need not be typed the same way each time it is given as long as
it parses and defaults appropriately, EINE will read that function's
definition out of the file into an editor buffer named after the
function itself, and select it.  Later, you can reselect the
definition with another EDIT DEFINITION command, or by using Select
Buffer (which may be more convenient, because it offers completion on
the function name). 

  EINE remembers which functions have been read from which files.
You can use the extended command "LIST FILES" to see which files have
been read from, and the extended command "LIST FUNCTIONS" to see the
names of the functions read in from a specific file.  That command
also tells you which functions are in need of updating on the PDP-10
(because they have been edited in the LISP machine since last read or
written).

  When you are satisfied with the changes you have made to the
functions in a file, you can write them back to the PDP-10 with the
extended command "UPDATE FILE".  This command reads the name of a file
and updates it, writing back to the PDP-10 all of the functions read
from that file which have been modified since last read or written.

  It is impossible to update some of the functions in a file without
updating them all.  However, if you wish to cancel the changes made to
a particular function, you can use the "KILL BUFFER" extended
command, which discards the buffer containing that function's
definition, losing all record that it was ever read in from the PDP-10.
Another "EDIT DEFINITION" command will read the old definition back
from the PDP-10;  alternatively, you can do nothing, and be sure that
the unwanted changes will not be written out by "UPDATE FILE".

  You may also want to discard several functions after updating their
file, or you may wish to forget all of the functions read in from that
file.  The extended command "FORGET FILE" will do that.  Of course,
this does not undefine the functions, or delete them from their file;
it just makes the LISP machine editor forget that it has looked at
them.

  If you ever wish to read in all of the functions from a file, you
can use the extended command "LOAD WHOLE FILE", which will load each of the
functions in the file just as "EDIT DEFINITION" would have loaded it.
You can use "LIST FUNCTIONS" to find out what all of their names are.
However, doing this is very slow.  The main point
is to make this operation unnecessary. 

How The File Is Divided into Function Definitions:

  Normally, every top-level-list whose function is DEFUN, MACRO,
DEFMACRO or DEFSTRUCT is considered to be the heart of one definition.
The definition includes that list, any comments on the same line as
its terminating ")", and also any non-definition top-level-lists and
semicolon comments between it and the previous definition.  Thus, the
declarations that precede a function definition will be included with
it when the definition is read in.

  EINE provides ways to override these heuristics in the form of the
no-op functions BEGF and ENDF.  You can specify the precise
boundaries, in the file, of the definition of FOO, by putting a form
(BEGF FOO) at the beginning and (ENDF FOO) at the end.  Thus,

(BEGF FOO-INIT)

(DEFUN FOO-INIT (SETQ FOO-VARIABLE '(78 56 34 200)))

(FOO-INIT)

(ENDF FOO-INIT)

will cause the (FOO-INIT) call to be included with FOO-INIT's DEFUN,
instead of with the following DEFUN.  The BEGF and ENDF will be
explicitly visible in the definition as read in.
Essentially, everything from the BEGF to the ENDF is regarded
as "the DEFUN of the function", and that together with preceding
comments and declarations will be read in as the definition.
The intent is that such comments and declarations be within the
BEGF-ENDF range, but preceding comments and declarations are
included to make sure that they belong to SOME function.

  You can also use BEGF and ENDF to delimit the definition of
something which is defined by other than DEFUN, MACRO, DEFSTRUCT and
DEFMACRO (eg, by SETQ).  For example,

(BEGF FOO-LIST)

(DECLARE (SPECIAL FOO-LIST))

(SETQ FOO-LIST '(FOO))

(ENDF FOO-LIST)

In this case, only the ENDF is actually needed;  the BEGF is
superfluous.  EINE will interpret the ENDF as being the definition of
FOO-LIST, including, as usual, all the preceding non-definitional
top-level-lists (the DECLARE and the SETQ).  BEGF is needed only when
the definition body includes some DEFUNs, etc., that might cause EINE
to come to hasty conclusions if not warned in advance that an ENDF was
coming along later.


The Head and Tail of a File:

  Most files have a bunch of declarations and setq's at the beginning,
which are not related especially to any one function in the file, and
certainly not related particularly to the FIRST function in the file.
But the normal heuristic would group them with that first
function.  To avoid this, you should place an (ENDF HEAD) after them,
before the comments and declarations for the first function.

  This ENDF causes the file's prologue of declarations to be part of
the "definition" of "HEAD", which is a name that is treated specially
by EINE.  Normally, EINE assumes that a function is defined in only
one file, thus permitting it to remember automatically WHICH file each
known function has been read in from.  Thus, having once read in the
function FOO, you can reselect it without having to respecify the file
it belongs to.  However, every file can have its own HEAD, so EINE
must keep track of them all separately.  As a result, you can read in
the HEADs of several different files and EINE will keep them all
straight, but it means that you can't reselect the HEAD of a file
without saying each time which file's HEAD you want.  Since there can
be only one buffer named HEAD at a time, the buffer that HEAD is read
into is called not HEAD, but HEAD-fn1-fn2-dev:-sname;, so that the
heads of different files live in differently named buffers.

  Another name treated specially, just like HEAD, is TAIL.  The
section TAIL is intended to contain things executed at the end of the
file, which use all or many of the functions in it to initialize the
data structures.

  ED-SPECIAL-SECTION-LIST is a list of names to be treated specially
in this way.
