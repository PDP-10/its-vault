New Lisp Machine keyboards.  (proposal or rough plan)

They should be hardware compatible with the present keyboards,
but not 100% software compatible.  See below.  Note that the
clock will have to be slowed down to 50 KHz or so (exact
figure to be computed later) to make the 8748 able to win.

Present hardware character format conventions:

A character is 24 bits, sent low-order bit first.  There is also
a "start bit" or "request signal", which is low.  Bits appear
on the cable in true-high form.  The cable is high when idle.
The clock is high when idle, and the falling edge is the clock
in the central machine.  The leading edge (check this) is the
clock in the keyboard.

The old (present) keyboards send 1's for the high 9 bits.

Bit 16 is normally 1, 0 for the "remote mouse" which the IOB
claims to support but no copies of which exist.  Whether the IOB
hardware actually looks at this bit is under program control.

The IOB boots the lisp machine if a character is received with
bits 10-13 = 1, bit 8 = 0, and bit 16 = 1 (bit 16 may or may
not be looked at depending on remote mouse enable.)

Here is the proposed new standard character format:
	15-0	Information
	18-16	Source ID
	23-19	Reserved, must be 1's.

The following source ID's are defined:
	111	Old keyboard, information is as follows:
		5-0	keycode
		7-6	shift
		9-8	top
		11-10	control
		13-12	meta
		14	shift-lock
		15	unused
	110	IOB's "remote mouse", this also uses up codes 000, 010, 100
		This could be flushed if we're never going to use it.
	101	Reserved.
	001	New keyboard, information as follows:
		14-15	Reserved, normally 0.
		10-13	Reserved, normally all 0.
			Must not be all 1 or would boot.
		9	0=normal:
		  8	1=key up, 0=key down
		  7	reserved for expansion, must be 0
		  6-0	keycode (not same codes as old keyboards)
		9	1=reset (sent instead of key-up when last non-lock key released)
		  8-0	Bit-mask of which locking keys are held down (only 4 used?)
		All key-encoding, including hacking of shifts, will be done
		in software in the central machine, not in the keyboard.  Note
		that both pressing and releasing a key send a code, therefore
		the central machine knows the status of all keys.  If the machine
		somehow gets out of phase, the next time the user presses and releases
		a key a reset (bit 9=1) message will be sent, getting it back into phase.

		Signalling a boot (will this be a separate key on the new kbd?)
		will also be specially encoded by the keyboard.   A character
		with bits 10-13 = 1, bit 8 = 0, and suitable information for
		type of boot in bits 7-0 will be sent (46 octal for cold-boot,
		62 octal for warm-boot).

	011	Mouse attached via new keyboard.  Information as follows:
		5-0	Delta-X, 2's complement
		11-6	Delta-Y, 2's complement
		12	0.  Prevents accidental booting.
		15-13	Current status of buttons.
		Every time the mouse moves or the button status changes,
		a mouse character is sent, except that there is a minimum
		delay between mouse characters of probably 1/30th or 1/40th
		second.  Between characters the keyboard tracks motion of
		the mouse.  These mouse characters will not be processed
		by hardware in the IOB.  They will probably be processed
		by the CADR microcode interrupt handler.

An outline of the 8748 program will appear here.
