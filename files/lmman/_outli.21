	Outline of the Lisp Machine Manual.		DLW 12/18/77 -*-Fundamental-*-

	The first version of this outline will just be a list of sections,
in the rough order in which they will appear.  More structure can be added
to taste.

INTRODUCTION: (I.xxxx files)

  o Explanation of what the Lisp Machine is (briefly), and
    of the scope of the manual.				(I.NTRO file)

  o Structure of the manual (MACLISP 1.2)		(I.NTRO file)

  o Short paragraph comparing to maclisp and interlisp, but most of that stuff
    later.						(I.NTRO file)

  o Short section on notional conventions, and explaining some things that might be
    confusing.  E.g., there are some character set things everyone should know,
    but don't give the complete character set description until later.
    Also, warning not to pay attention to the AREA stuff when you see "CONS-IN-AREA".
    Warn about things in only for Maclisp compatibility.
							(I.NTRO file)

  o Long section based on Bernie Greenberg's Lisp notes, which describe Lisp from
    the ground up, written for someone with some programming experience but no Lisp
    at all.  To give some idea of the level of detail in here, this section should
    be applicable to MACLISP also (with minimal differences), i.e., we shouldn't
    get into Lisp Machine peculiarities in this section.
							(I.BOOK file)

  o The data types present in the Lisp Machine, not including esoteric things like
    symbol headers, but at least an introduction to arrays.  Explain function cells.
    Explain the details of the process of evaluation.  Explain &stuff.  &rest problem.
							(I.LISP file)

  o Short section on how to log in and out, etc.  Longer section on this later?
							(I.REAL file)
