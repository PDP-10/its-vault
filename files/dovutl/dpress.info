This program has been in existance for a few months, but has not
been announced except through the grape vine.

DPRESS (on MC) is a program that takes as input a PRESS file and
displays it on PLASMA TVs. It does have some shortcomings,
however, that XD (the XGP display program for AI TVs) and XP (for
PLASMA TVs) does not have. The major shortcoming is fonts. PRESS
files are normally sent to the DOVER which has a resolution of
384 bits per linear inch. This is about twice as much as the XGPs
resulotion and consequently files for all the fonts would be four
times as large. This would be unreasonable, and it would also
restrict the viewing area of a page by a factor of 2 in each
direction. To compensate, DPRESS uses ALTO resolution fonts,
which are about 80 bits per linear inch. Now the problem of
quality comes up. 10 pitch fonts at 80 bits per inch start to get
messy, but people will have to learn to live with it. Luckily,
there is a public file of font width information, so fonts that
are registered in this file will be properly spaced, whether they
be fixed width or variable. The computer modern fonts used by TEX
are a different story. DPRESS knows what the characters of
CMATHX, CMR10 and CMSY10 look like, but these fonts are not
registered in the width tables. Luckily, TEX repositions the
point often enough that this does not lead to too many problems.

Currently this only runs on MC, but with some proding/help it
could also be modified to know about AI TVs and LispMachines. If
it learns about AI TVs, a directory will probably have to be
created for the ALTO FONTS. For use on the LispMachine, the user
will have to SUPDUP to MC or AI and a display code will have to
be implemented on the LispMachines in order to send raster
images. 

To invoke:
	:DPRESS <press file name>
or 
	:DPRESS
or
	DPRESS^K
The latter two will prompt for a filename. Type ? for a list of
commands, they are very similar to XD/XP.

I (DCP@MC) am the writer and current maintainer. There is a
BUG-DPRESS mailing list for BUGS. The following things are known
about, so please don't flame too much unless you have
constructive suggestions:
	There is no MINI MODE, since you already see most of the
	  page, and it would be a royal pain to implement.
	It does know about the NEWVEC font, so graphics should
	  work.
	The smaller fonts are bound to look bad because of the
	  small resolution.
	TEX fonts usually win, now that we have most of the CM
	  fonts from Metafont and most of the fonts are
	  registered in the public width file. If you repeatedly
	  use a font which has a ## displayed next to it, that
	  means it is not known. If you REALLY want it, let me
	  know and I will see if I can find it someplace.
If there is enough response, I will create an INFO-DPRESS mailing
list for announcing changes that people should know about. If you
want to have some fun, try 
:DPRESS TEXLIB;HAIR

Have fun,
DCP
