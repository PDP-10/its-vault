;It doesn't actually compile or evaluate anything,

; a form to process, and a flag which is one of these atoms:
;  SPECIAL  -  QC-FILE should eval this and put it in the FASL file.
;  DECLARE  -  QC-FILE should eval this.
;  DEFUN    -  QC-FILE should compile this and put the result in the FASL file.
;  MACRO    -  This defines a macro.  QC-FILE should eval this and also
;               put it in the FASL file.
;  BEGF     -  This is a BEGF or ENDF, which delimits a function definition in
;		the source file.  QC-FILE will someday want to put suitable
;		information inthe FASL file.
;  RANDOM   -  QC-FILE should just put this in the FASL file to be evalled.
;Of course, operations other than QC-FILE will want to do different things
;in each case, but they will probably want to distinguish the same cases.
