;Method Stuff.
; This is intended to provide a complete interface to the METHOD system, ie,
;this is the only part of the system which ever knows what a DTP-SELECT-METHOD
;is, etc.  The implementation could be changed to use hash tables, for example,
;with no changes elsewhere in the system.  (Or even, the choice between DTP-SELECT-METHOD
;and hash tables can be made dynamically by the system based on how many methods there are,
;which is probably what we will eventually want).

;What a DTP-SELECT-METHOD does:
;  When applied as a function, it assumes its first argument is
;an operation.  The DTP-SELECT-METHOD itself points to a (somewhat extended) ASSQ
;list, which associates possible operations with METHODs.  The given operation
;is looked up on the ASSQ list, and if found, the DTP-SELECT-METHOD replaces itself
;with the matched METHOD and reinvokes the function application mechanism.  If the
;search reaches the end of the ASSQ list, DTP-SELECT-METHOD reports an error if the
;ASSQ list terminated in NIL.  Otherwise, if it ended in a SYMBOL, the DTP-SELECT-METHOD
;replaces itself with that symbol and reinvokes the function application mechanism.
;Note that in the important case that this symbol happens to contain a DTP-SELECT-METHOD
;in its function cell, the result will be that the search continues using that
;ASSQ list, etc.

;What a DTP-SELECT-METHOD looks like:
; (1) it is normally found in the function cell of a symbol.  This symbol is referred
;     to as the CLASS-SYMBOL.
; (2) it is a list, each of whose elements may be:
;   (a) a CONS of a SYMBOL and a METHOD.  An ASSQ list element associating SYMBOL 
;	  (as an operation) with METHOD.  METHOD can be anything meaningful in LISP
;	  function context.
;   (b) a CONS of a list of symbols and a METHOD.  Similar to 3, but all the symbols
;         are associated with the method
;	  At the moment, this possibility is unused, because
;	  making it work right through various sequences of redefining
;	  some but not all of the symbols requires considerable hair.
;   (c) a SYMBOL (assumed to be a CLASS-SYMBOL).  A one level "subroutine call" 
;	to the methods directly associated with the SYMBOL.  If a suitable method is
;	not found, the CLASS-SYMBOL's superclass, etc are not searched, instead,
;	the search resumes with the next element of the original SELECT-METHOD list.
;	This feature is used if the class has more than one superclass.  In that case,
;       ALL superior classes are enumerated in the SELECT-METHOD list of this class,
;       in the desired search order.
;  (3) a tail pointer.  If NIL, an error is reported if search reaches here, otherwise,
;	it should be a CLASS-SYMBOL for the superclass.
;	
; A Class has a symbol associated with it, called the class-symbol.
; The value of the class-symbol is the class entity itself.
; The function definition of the class-symbol is the select-method.


;; This is the standard way of defining a method of a class,
;; so that the code will be compiled.  Note that DEFMETHOD works for
;; both Class methods and Flavor methods.
;; SPEC is one of (:message), (:BEFORE :message), or (:AFTER :message),
;; in the case where CLASS-NAME is a flavor.
;; If in place of the lambda-list you have a symbol, and the body
;; is null, that symbol is a function which stands in for the method.
;;*** This has been superseded by a definition in FLAVOR
