This is a description of the Major Mode offered in Emacs by doing
M-X Fortran Mode.

"	Runs ^R Fortran Read Hollerith. This will read a string from the
	echo area (ended with <Return>) and insert it in the buffer as a
	hollerith string in the buffer. Eg, "ABC<Return> inserts 3HABC in
	the buffer.

Tab	Runs ^R Indent for Fortran. This will move leading digits toward the
	first column and program text toward column 7. A leading
	continuation line character) is stripped if it exists. With an
	argument, Tab will indent for continuation line, inserting a
	continuation character in column 6. Tab will try to leave the cursor
	in the same position on the line relative to the program text as the
	user was initially. Eg, in a line of text like "100x=y+5.", with the
	cursor between the y and the +, will change the text to "100 x=y+5."
	with the cursor still between the y and the +.

M-;	Goes to the previous line. If it is not a comment, a comment line
	is inserted. If it is a comment, the cursor is left just after 
	the "C" which begins the comment.

C-M-;	On a non-comment line, this is a no-op. On a line which is a comment,
	will kill the text on the line, leaving the cursor at the head of
	a blank line.

M-N	Goes to down a line. If not on a comment line, creates a comment line.

M-P	Goes up a line. If not on a comment line, creates a comment line.

Linefeed  Typed at the end of a line, just indents the line normally.
	  If typed in the middle of a line, moves the text of the rest of
	  the line to column 7, preceding it with a continuation character
	  in column 6 to denote continuation.

M-J	Indents the next line as a continuation line unconditionally.
C-M-J	Is the same as M-J

M-^	Merges the current line with the previous, removing continuation
	character if necessary.

M-=	Types out information on the screen which points to columns 6 and 72
	for purposes of not accidentally running over the end of the line.
	The text typed out is not inserted into the buffer, but it may type
	over some of the text on the screen. Typing C-L will flush the display
	left over from M-=.

Some Fortran implementations allow the user to use more free-format coding
style. In some such implementations, Tab is used as a convenient way of
terminating the label field. To make label fields end in column 8 with Tab
filling out the gap at the end of the [optional] line number, you can do

	1 m.v Fortran Indent With Tabs

in an init file or in a minibuffer.

Fortran Mode defaultly uses "%" to denote continuation lines.
Some Fortran implementations will not allow the "%" character for 
continuations, or some programmers may not find that character aesthetic.
A different character may be selected for use as the continuation line
character by putting into the variable Fortran Continuation Character,
the ASCII value of the character to be used. eg, to use "*" (ascii 52 octal)
you would do (in a minibuffer or an init file):

	52. m.v Fortran Continuation Character
