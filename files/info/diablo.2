:DIABLO is a program for outputing using the "Diablo" flow control
protocol.  This protocol is used by some diablo, hp and some other
terminals/printers.  Briefly the protocol consists of sending blocks of
characters (usually about 80 characters long) followed by an ETX (003,
Control-C), and then stops.  If the characters arrive at the terminal
faster than the terminal can print them, they are buffered by the terminal
(in a FIFO).  The ETX character is buffered just like a printing
character.  When get around to "printing" the ETX, it transmits back an
ACK (007, Control-F) character.  When the diablo program receives the ACK
character it then transmits the next block.

Usage:

   :DIABLO dev:dir;fn1 fn2/<single letter switch>

Where switches are on of the following:

/T    send the string to set the tabs (to every 8 spaces) on a diablo 1620
      before transmitting the file. 

/B    Use big (256) character blocks.  The default is 60 characters.

/S    "Spinwriter" option.  Use big blocks and don't double buffer.


Notes:
  The hardware tabs on your terminal better be set correctly as the
program does not expand tabs on output.  No attempt is made to pagination,
skip over perforation or anything else.  This program should really be
combined with :LPX.
