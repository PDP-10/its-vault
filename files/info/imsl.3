IMSL = International Mathematical and Statistical Library

The IMSL routines are a numerical analysis package written originally
in Fortran and translated locally into Lisp to enable them to be interfaced
to Macsyma.

The per routine documentation accessable via this INFO node has been 
extracted from comments at the head of the source files. The part of
the documentation pertaining to calling conventions for the various 
routines may or may not remain valid for the Lisp translations and
Macsyma interfaces to the translations.

There will in the near future be a set of IMSL routines available for the
Macsyma user, probably via a package BATCH'd off of the share directory.
At that time, this node will be updated to reflect information about how
to call those routines from Macsyma: types of arguments, how return values
are handled, etc.

The routines as supplied by IMSL are organized by "chapters" according
to the first letter of the routine name.
