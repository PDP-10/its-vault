File: DOVER,  Node: Normal,  Previous: Top,  Up: Top,  Next: Switches

The DOVER queuer accepts file commands, which specify a file to be
printed and optionally a font to be used.  The general form is:

	:DOVER [file-specification][_ fonts-spec-list]

	:DOVER .INFO.;DDT ORDER _ HELVETICA10I

file-specification

	The normal ITS file name, which may be a text file, XGP file,
	or press format file.  <device> defaults to local DSK:
	(i.e. if you are on MC, <device> defaults to MC:), <sname>
	defaults to your <msname> (i.e. the default sname for the job).
	The second filename defaults to PRESS if such a file exists;
	if not, PRE is tried (for Scribe users), and finally > is used.

	The DOVER program automatically figures out whether the file
	is a PRESS file or a text file (but you can always say
	/PRESS, /XGP, or /ASCII).

_ fonts-specification

	Any number of font names or file-specifications delimited
	by commas that define the fonts to be used.  A font name for
	the Dover consists of a font family name, a points-size, and a
	face code.  The family name in the above example is
	"HELVETICA"; the points-size, 10; the face code, I for Italic.
	Other letters that may appear in face codes are C for
	Compressed, E for Expanded, L for Light, and B for Bold.  Any
	consistent combination of these may be used, or none.

	The fonts-specification is optional.  If it is absent, the
	default font is LPT8.

Switches can also be included in the command to select options or set
parameters.  They should go after the file specification or after the
fonts specification.  It is also possible to supply a jcl line
containing only switches, e.g.:

	:DOVER /STATUS

The only switches that make sense here are /STATUS and /QUEUE,
since all others apply only when a file is sent.

Switches and Modifier Commands

  The syntax of a switch is "/" followed by the switch name,
optionally followed by a ":" and the argument of the command.
The argument, or the switch name if there is no argument, is
terminated by a space, slash, "_", or the end of the line.
Examples:

	FOO BAR/SKIP:10_LPT8/LFTMAR:2540

  The shortest unique prefix of any switch is sufficient.
However, there are also some special abbreviations for commonly
used switches, which are not necessarily unique prefixes.  Here
is a list of them:
	/A	for /ASCII
	/D	for /DELETE
	/L	for /LIST
	/N	for /NOTIFY
	/Q	for /QUEUE
	/S	for /STATUS
	/T	for /TEXT
	/X	for /XGP

  Three switches specify what sort of file is being dealt with.
Normally, the DOVER program can figure this out for itself, so there
is generally no need to use one of these switches.  However, if :DOVER is
invoked by another program, for reliability the appropriate one of
these switches ought to be specified if the type of file is known.

/ASCII or /TEXT	This file contains ordinary ASCII text.
/PRESS		This file is a PRESS file.
/XGP		This file is an XGP file.

  When none of these switches appears, the file is considered a
PRESS file if the first 16 bits of a certain word of the file is
equal to the "magic" number 27183.  The word used is the last
word that has an address that is 0 mod 128.; this should be the
first word of the last record of the file, if it really is a
PRESS file.  Otherwise, the file is considered a TEXT file,
unless its second name is XGP, in which case it is treated as an
XGP file.  You must specify /XGP to process an XGP file if its
second name is not "XGP".  If /TEXT (/XGP) is not specified, but
the file is to be treated as a text (XGP) file, the file is
checked to see if it really looks like a text (XGP) file, in
order to suppress printing of binary files, which is never nice.
Currently a text file is rejected if it contains more than 10%
non-formatting control characters (i.e., control characters that
are not tabs, linefeeds, carriage returns, or formfeeds).  An
XGP file is rejected on the same basis, except that a
compensation is made to discount XGP escape sequences (rubouts
are not counted, and 4 times the number of rubouts present is
subtracted from the number of non-formatting control characters
before the 10% check is made).  Just about any reasonable file
should pass this test, and if the file you want does not, you
can always specify /TEXT or /XGP -- but please make SURE it is
not a binary file first!

  Several switches control where the output goes.  First, there is

/DISKOU or /DSKOUT	Put the output on disk, in <msname>;FOO PRESS,
			instead of sending it to the Dover or spooling.

When /DISK is not specified, the normal behavior depends upon
the site on which DOVER is running, as follows:

	MC, ML, DM:	Send to the MC spooler by default.

	AI:		Send to the Dover directly by default,
			unless it is busy, in which case spool
			to MC.

The Dover is considered busy if it says so or does not respond
to queries, AND there are several files queued on MC.  (The
latter is detected by the existence of the file .XGPR.;%DOVER BUSY
on AI, which is created/deleted by the MC spooler as conditions
change, automatically.)

  In any case, the output from DOVER will make it clear what
happened.

  The following switches permit you get behavior different from
the default:

/SPOOL, /SP		Send to the spooler on MC, regardless.
			When a file is spooled, the file itself
			is written to MC:.DOVR.;$<xuname> > (the
			$ is a dollar sign, not an altmode), and
			and spooling information is written in
			the file MC:.DOVR.;-QUEUE >.  The actual
			filenames are printed for you.  Note:
			even on MC, a copy is made, not a link.

/EFTP			Send to the Dover directly, regardless.
			This has an effect only on AI and MC,
			since ML and DM cannot talk directly to
			the Dover.

NOTE:  Use of /EFTP is considered anti-social unless you have
good reason, since everything has been designed to take
efficiency and fairness into account.

In cases where DOVER keeps trying to send directly, it will let
you type ^S to spool the file instead, ^G to give up entirely.
It may take a little while to respond to ^S or ^G.

  The notify option takes effect only if the file is spooled:

/NOTIFY, /N		Have the MC spooler do a SEND to you when
			your file has reached the Dover.  (It
			may be a while after that before it is
			printed, but it is the best we can do.)
			You may also do /NOTIFY:user or
			/NOTIFY:user@site, to have the send go
			to someone or someplace other than
			XUNAME@<current-site>.  The site defaults
			to the current site.  If you are not
			logged in at the time, the message is
			discarded, unless there was an error, in
			which case it turns into mail.


  There are two switches that control printing of status
information after the request (if any) has been processed:

/STATUS, /S		Print the Dover's status, if you are on
			a site that can talk to it.

/QUEUE, /Q		List the MC spooler queue (DVR^F).


  The /DELETE (/D) switch will delete a PRESS or XGP file after
it is successfully sent or queued.  For safety, it is ignored on
TEXT files.

  Three more switches control what part of the file is printed, and
how many times.  They work on text files and on press files.

/COPIES:n		Make n copies.
/SKIP:n			Skip the first n pages of the file.
/START:n		Start with page n; equivalent to /SKIP:n-1
/LASTPAGE:n		Stop printing after page n.
			0 means keep going to the end of the file.
/STOP:n			Equivalent to /LASTPAGE:n.

  The other switches set parameters which control how the text of a
file appears on the page.  They are relevant only when the DOVER
program is printing a text file.  When an existing PRESS file is being
printed, the parameters are not used, because the program which
generated the PRESS file has already made the decisions.

  For switches which take arguments, the default value of the
parameter (the value used if the switch is NOT specified) appears in
brackets.  Many switches specify distances on the paper.  These
arguments are in units of Micas (1 Mica = 10 Microns).

/BOTMAR:n [1270]	Use n micas of bottom margin.
/BRACKET		Print altmode (033 octal) as ^[, if printing
			control characters with up-arrows.
/CTL			Print control characters with up-arrows.
			This is the default.  A special
			character (013) is used for the up-arrow
			in the LPT fonts, but octal code 136
			(the usual up-arrow) is used otherwise.
			See also /BRACKET, /DOLLAR, and /SAIL.
/DOLLAR			Print altmode (033 octal) as a dollar
			sign.  This is the default if printing
			control characters with up-arrow and the
			font family is not LPT.  (LPT
			has a nice symbol for Altmode.)
/LFTMAR:n [2540]	Use n micas of left margin.
/LIST or /L		Put a header on each page, containing the
			filename, date and page number.
/LSP:n			Use n points per line (includes font height
			and points between lines)
/RGTMAR:n [1270]	Use n micas of right margin.
/SAIL			Print control characters "as is", as whatever
			the font defines for their character codes.
			With the LPT font family, this will give you
			the Sail characters such as you can see ojn
			the screen if you do :TCTYP SAIL.
			With Xerox fonts, it will give you the Xerox
			assignment of graphics, which is different.
/TOPMAR:n [1270]	Use n micas of top margin
/TXTCMD:n [-1]		If n is nonzero, and the file is an XGP file,
			read semicolon-commands from the file
			to set parameters.
/UNPAGED		Treat ^L as a control character instead
			of starting a new page.
/VSP:n [*]		Use n points between lines.
			What this really means is that n is added to the
			point height of font 0 to get the value of the LSP
			parameter.

* The default interline spacing, if neither LSP nor VSP is set,
is 120% of the point size of font 0.

  XGP files can contain parameter specifications in the form of
semicolon commands, on the first page.  If TXTCMD is -1, then :DOVER
reads the first page of the file to look for such commands.  However,
horizontal distances specified in the XGP file are in units of XGP
dots rather than micas, so that the same file can print compatibly on
the XGP and on the Dover.  A semicolon command starts with a semicolon
followed by the name of the parameter, a space, and the argument.
Semicolon commands can also be used to specify the parameters from the
terminal, like switches.  In this case, the semicolon command sets the
parameter for the next time that a command to actually print a file is
seen.

Input Editing Commands

^C	like CR, but return to DDT after this line
	 if no error is encountered.
^D	flush entire input buffer
^H	same as RUBOUT
^L	re-display the buffer
^Q	quote the next character in a file specification
^U	kill current line

A line does not necessary constitute a complete command if it is a
semicolon-command which specifies a parameter for the printing.  In
this case, the first line which is not a semicolon command finished
the complete command, and until that line is finished it is still
possible to rub all the way back through the lines containing the
semicolon command.  Also, a syntax error in a line deletes only that
line, and not previous lines which were part of the same complete
command.

Printing XGP Files with :DOVER

  There are two types of commands that can go in files printed on the
XGP, in addition to ordinary text.  First, there are semicolon
commands which serve the same purpose as parameter setting switches.
Second, there are the short sequences of characters used for font
switching, underlining, etc.  These are called "XGP escapes".

  The first page of the file may contain "modifier commands", such as
";LFTMAR" to specify the left margin, or ";VSP" to specify the vertical
spacing.  *Note Modifiers: Switches, for a description of modifier
commands, the semicolon forms of switches.  Each command must
be on a separate line, with the semicolon at the beginning of the line.
Unrecognized commands are ignored, in case the file simply happened to
contain lines starting with a semicolon.  A nonempty line which does
not start with a semicolon indicates that there are no more commands.

  Unless you specify otherwise, the semicolon commands will be printed
just like all the rest of the page.  To avoid that, reserve the first
page for semicolon commands only, and include a ";SKIP 1" among them,
so that the first page will not be printed at all. 

  Many of the semicolon commands meaningful to the XGP are
intrinsically meaningless for the DOVER.  They will be ignored.  They
include ;KSUBSET and ;SQUISH for loading only selected characters of a
font (since the Dover doesn't need to worry about this), and the
parameters controlling paper size (since the Dover uses precut paper).

  The XGP allows the file to specify its own fonts with a ;KSET
command.  :DOVER cannot use the XGP font file names which appear
therein, so you must specify the Dover fonts explicitly in the command
line when you ask to print the file.  There is a facility in :DOVER
for knowing the Dover equivalents of specific XGP font files, but as
of now no equivalences are known.

  The XGP file can also specify the names of the Dover fonts directly
with the ;DFONTS command, as in ";DFONTS HELVETICA10,HELVETICA10I".
Why would an XGP file contain Dover font names?  Only if it were
written by a program which used to write output for the XGP and has
been converted to know about Dover fonts and the FONTS WIDTHS file but
not to write real PRESS files.

  Once printing is under way, :DOVER is compatible with the XGP,
except that a couple of XGP escape codes are not implemented.
Note that some XGP escape codes will, when used, embody
assumptions about the widths of characters in various fonts, and
it is quite likely that these assumptions will turn out false
when the Dover fonts aren't precisely compatible with the
analogous XGP fonts on which the assumptions were based.

  *Note XGP: (XGP)Files, for more details on the format of XGP files.

File: DOVER,  Node: Spruce,  Previous: XGP,  Up: Top,  Next: DPRESS

Spruce is the name of the program that controls the Dover.  It
normally receives and prints Press files (it does not accept
text files, unlike the XGP).  There are some things that you can
do via typing to Spruce on the Alto by the Dover that cannot be
done other ways.  For example, it is possible to separately
disable SPOOLING (that is, receipt and local storage of files on
Spruce's disk) and PRINTING (the actual output of files).  This
might be useful if you need to use special paper for some reason
(e.g., thesis).  It is suggested that you read the Spruce
Reference Manual through (skipping the sections on installation)
before doing this, so you don't screw things up.  A few minutes
reading is better than accidentally deleting unprinted files,
etc.  There should be a copy of that manual on top of the disk
underneath the table with the output sorting bins on it.  Make
sure it doesn't wander.  Naturally you should be sure to leave
spooling and printing on when you are done.  Casual Spruce
hacking is a no-no; further, if you must hack Spruce, try to do
it at non-peak times, or many angry users may descend on you.

Overflow protection - if you play around with Spruce, please
leave it in JOB overflow protection mode.  Overflow protection
refers to counting pages to make sure the output bin does not
overflow (it would be a real mess it stuff just fell on the
floor!) CONTINUOUS overflow protection means it stops every 500
pages or so, waiting for somebody to say it's OK to go ahead.
The output usually is filed fast enough that this is a loss --
it won't overflow, but there often is not someone there to type
P to tell it to go ahead.  JOB overflow protection means stop if
there is more than 500 pages in a single output request, and
wait for confirmation.  It is possible to turn overflow
protection completely off, but job mode seems a better idea.  To
get job mode, type 6<Carriage-return> at Spruce.

Care and feeding of the Dover -- although things like putting in
more paper, toner, or fuser oil, and clearing jams are simple
operations, it is asked that you NOT do them unless you have
been specifically trained.  The reason is that if they are not
done well, a number of problems can result.  For example, care
must be used in putting in more paper, or many jams will result
(probably AFTER the person who put the paper in is long gone).
Use care and common sense -- leave anything you don't thoroughly
understand to the experts.

Documentation for DPRESS:		DPRESS 564, 2/13/81

DPRESS is a program for displaying PRESS files. Currently
it displays on the PLASMA TV system centered in building 38
and on Lisp Machines.

DPRESS is invoked by
	DPRESS^K
or
	:DPRESS [optional <file spec>]
In the former, a file name is prompted for; in the latter it
tries to use <file spec>. The directory defaults to your current
working directory (MSNAME) and the second filename defaults to
PRESS, so most of the time just the first filename is sufficient.
If it can not find the file, it prompts again, and the components
of the last filename as defaults for the new. For example, if you
did
	:DPRESS FOO;BAR
but the press file is on directory BAZ, it is only necessary to say
	BAZ;
in response to the complaint.

DPRESS then takes the file and does primative checking to insure
it is a PRESS file, and makes a couple suggestions if it is not
(such as making sure you have a \END in a TEX file).

Now for the fonts -- and this gets hairy. It is unrealistic to
use the full 384 bits per linear inch, since this would be about
four times the diskspace per file than the XGP fonts take. So
DPRESS resorts to ALTO fonts, which are about 80 bits per inch.
This imposes severe resolution limitations, and the smaller fonts
do look messy. A known and presently unsolvable problem is
positioning of the Computer Math (CM) fonts, so some TEX files
may come out a little funny.

Page 1 is computed and the upper left hand corner is displayed.
Commands are provided to position the page on the screen and to
select a page of the document. These commands are documented
within the program by typing ? (question mark).

There are two associated mailing lists: BUG-DPRESS to report
bugs, and INFO-DPRESS to receive information about changes.
