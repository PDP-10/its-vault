The LP and LR family of devices send output to the PostScript, 
Impress, and QMS/QUIC printers around Tech Sq.

The device name determines which printer the output is sent to.  The
pattern is that the unit number is the floor number.  Where possible,
device names beginning with "LP" refer to a printers which go at greater
than 8 pages per minute.

The following devices are currently defined:

	LP9:	National-Enquirer
	LR9:	The-Wall-Street-Journal

	LP8:	Daily-Planet
	LR8:	The-Washington-Post

	LP7:	Pravda
	LR7:	Le-Monde

	LP6:	Celery
	LR6:	Oval

	LP5:	GI
	LR5:	Spam

	LP4:	Turkey
	LR4:	Salami

	LP3:	Ham
	LR3:	Charmin

	LP2:	Pulp
	LR2:	XPress

Currently only lineprinter-style printing of ASCII text is supported,
although this may change in the future.  (But see *Note Raw:Raw.)

For example, outputting to LP7: opens a connection to Reagan (where a
printer server runs) and transmits your text.  Thus

    ^R DSK:INFO;LPDEV >,LP7:      or      :COPY DSK:INFO;LPDEV >,LP7:

makes hardcopy of this info file.  Reading from LP7:.FILE. (DIR)
produces a listing of the queue, so you can type

    LP7^F                          or      :LISTF LP7:

to see who's output is in front of yours.  A typical queue listing looks
like:

    Status of The-Wall-Street-Journal:

    Recipient  Queued at          State     Title
    ALAN       7/17/89 14:02:53   Printing  AI: LR9: ALAN; PCLSR MEMO 496939 bytes
    CENT       7/17/89 14:03:17   Queued    ML: LR9: CENT; FOO BAR 15728 bytes
    ALAN       7/17/89 14:03:31   Queued    AI: LR9: ALAN; _COPY_ OUTPUT 24249 bytes

Deleting entries from the queue.

[ As of 7/17/89, deleting was broken. ]

All devices allow you to delete items from the queue.  For example, if
LP7^F shows you the following:

    7th Floor QMS is ready and printing
     Time  Owner     Job Files					Size
     01:57 alan      719 LP7: INFO; PRINT OUTPUT		280

    The most recent job printed was:
     01:57 alan          LP7: INFO; PRINT OUTPUT                          

then you can delete job 719 by doing

    ^O LP7:719		or		:DELETE LP7:719

or you can delete all entries owned by ALAN by doing

    ^O LP7:ALAN		or		:DELETE LP7:ALAN

(Any second filename and directory you supply will be ignored.)

File: LPDEV, Node: Commands, Previous: Deleting, Up: Top, Next: TPL

Sending control commands to a printer.

[ As of 7/17/89, control commands were broken. ]

Control commands can be sent to the spoolers which drive the 7th, 8th, and
9th floor printers.  Do this by reading <device>:.CMD. <command>.  For
example,

    ^R LP7:.CMD. DISABLE	or	 :PRINT LP7:.CMD. DISABLE

will disable the queue for the 7th floor QMS 2400.

How to set your "default" printer.

Many programs on ITS will send output to the TPL: device when asked to
produce lineprinter style output, most notably the :TPL command in DDT and
the :@ program.  Thus if you have a translation like

     TPL: *; * * , LP9: *; * *

defined in your init file, you have effectively set your default
lineprinter to be the 9th floor QMS 1200.  Now you can print simple files
by doing:

    :TPL .INFO.;CUBE INFO

and produce @ listings by doing:

    :@ FOO/88W

(The "/88W" is because @ normally assumes a lineprinter is 120 columns
wide.)

Talking to a printer in its native language.

[ As of 7/17/89, Raw mode no longer worked. ]

When an LP or LR device channel is opened using open-mode bit 1.4, output
is sent to the printers in their native language (generally PostScript, but
that varies from printer to printer).

To take advantage of this, you have to write a program.  No convenient
command is available.

Notes for maintainers.

The source code lives in AI:SYSEN1;LPDEV >.  The table at DEVTBL: is the
most likely thing to need changing.  It defines the mapping between device
names and the host names and printer names that provide the corresponding
services.

The server runs on Lisp Machines.  The source can be found on Reagan in the
file Reagan:>ITS>ITSLPT.lisp.  The ITSLPT protocol is simple, and the
source of the server is the only documentation.  The server runs on both
Reagan and Zermatt.  The AI lab printers go through Reagan and the LCS
printers through Zermatt.
