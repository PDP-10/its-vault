The photoscan is an extremely high resolution optical input device
used for converting two dimensional transparencies or prints
to image files on disk. The photoscan has three switch-selectable
rasters which determine its resolution, from 25 microns (.001 inches)
to 100 microns. The object to be scanned is loaded onto a drum
which then rotates lines of the image past a lens. The lens then moves
across its surface as successive image lines are processed. In
transmission mode (for transparencies) a focused beam of white light
passes through the film and is sensed by the lens on the other
side; in reflection mode, two fiber-optic light sources set at 90
degree angles to minimize specularity illuminate the subject from the
same side as the sensing lens. In addition, there is a four-position
color-filter wheel which can interpose a red, green or blue filter
between the subject and the sensing element if color information
is desired.

The photoscan's drum accomodates up to 8" x 10" film or prints.
The clamp arrangement makes mounting smaller
subjects extremely difficult; instead, if the subject is smaller
than 8x10, it should be affixed to a sheet of plain white
8x10 paper (for prints) or clear plastic (for transparencies)
to facilitate mounting on the scanner drum.

The photoscan returns data of 8 bits for each pixel (picture element),
but the PS program has the capacity to pack that data into
pixels of arbitrary bit length in the disk image file. There
is a special capability to pack the scanned image as a binary
file, whereby the user can specify an arbitrary black/white threshold.

The program, PS, runs in two parts -- on ITS and on the mini-robot
11/40. Except for starting up the 11/40, this latter portion of
the program's operation is invisible to the user, but it makes
possible a maximum scan rate (determined by the photoscan itself and
(nearly) independent of ITS system load), and at the same time
places a minimal load on the ITS system.

SETTING UP THE PHOTOSCAN:

1. Turn the photoscan on. The main power switch is a circuit breaker,
located inside the white cabinet door below the drum area, on the upper
right. In order to get good performance from the photoscan, it
must be powered up about 20 minutes prior to use so that its
photomultipliers can stabilize. Do not leave the photoscan
powered up for excessive periods of time (e.g. overnight),
as it eventually suffers from overheating.

2. While inside the white cabinet door, locate the two-position
toggle switch just below the on/off breaker. When up, this switch
is in the 2D position, and when down, in the 3D position. When
in 2D, film (paper) densities of 2.0 (very dark grey) will scan
to data 255. When in 3D, densities of 3.0 (completely black) will
scan to 255. Select the setting you wish.

3. Place the subject on the light table to the left of the scanner,
so that it is face up (emulsion side down) with the lower left
corner of the subject in the upper left corner of the table. The 
subject should be squared against the guide and the back surface
of the hole punch. Punch two holes in the subject by pressing firmly
on the punch handle. Using the grid on the light table, determine
the coordinates of the region to be scanned (x,y lower left and
x,y upper right). X is read from the scale on the left, and Y from
the scale at the bottom of the table. (The on/off switch for the
light table is on the right side).

4. Select the raster desired. There are two thumb-wheels inside
the plexiglas cover which must be set to the desired raster
value: one is inside the drum, and must be set before the film
(paper) is loaded on the drum; the other is near the lens on
the bottom. The lower wheel also contains the filter-select
wheel, which should be set to R, G, or B if a color filter is
desired, or to the blank setting for no filter.

In addition to the two thumb wheels inside the cover, the raster must
be set on the three-position switch on the right portion of the
main control panel. THIS SETTING SHOULD NEVER BE CHANGED WHILE
THE DRUM IS ROTATING. If the drum is rotating, press the STOP
switch before changing this setting, then press RUN.

All three raster selections (the two thumb-wheels and the rotary
switch) must agree.

For prints, the lower thumb-wheel must be set on the REF setting
for reflection mode. This will cause the fiber-optic light sources
to light up. The other two settings (the other thumb-wheel and
the rotary switch) must be set on 100 microns, as the smaller
rasters cannot be used in reflection mode. Also, there is a white
cover which must be mounted over the zero reference slot on the
photoscan drum. The white cover resides on the photoscan table
and screws into holes on either side of the reference slot. The
cover must be removed for transparencies, and care should be
taken not to scratch the special glossy painted surface of the cover.

5. Mount the subject on the photoscan drum face outward (emulsion side
down) by first placing the left edge under the photoscan clamp with
the two guide pins so that the pins fit into the two holes you
punched in step 3. Then place the opposite edge under the other clamp,
taking care to remove any slack in the subject. It would be wise
to rotate the drum once by hand to ensure that the subject clears
the lens before turning the drum on.

6.  Close the plexiglas cover, and start the drum rotation by
pressing the RUN switch.

TO START UP THE PS PROGRAM:

Merely find an ITS terminal, log in, and type :PS. PS will identify
itself, and type the current RASTER setting of the photoscan RASTER
switch. Possible errors:

PDP11 not ready

The PDP11/40 is not running. See node 11/40 START-UP for details on
how to bootstrap the 11/40.

PDP11 in use

The PDP11 is in use by another PW or PS job, or at least the system
thinks it is. The PDP11 in use message can be overridden by bootstrapping
the PDP11 (see node 11/40 START-UP), if in fact the system has
lost track of the 11/40 status and it is not in use. This message
is usually accurate, however, so extreme care should be taken
before bootstrapping the 11/40, lest you destroy someone else's job.
The PDP11/40 can be in use because of (1) another PS user, (2) another
PW user, or (3) an 11/45 user in the mini-robot room. If (1) or (2)
is the case, a PEEK should reveal the presence of a job named PW or PS
and will also tell you who the owner is. Further, there should be some
evidence that the photowriter or photscan is in use because one of
those two machines will already be powered up and probably will have
its lights blinking. In case (3), however, the only way to be sure
is to go into the mini-robot room, and try to find the person using
the 11/45, and ask him if he really is using the 11/40 as well.

Photoscan not ready (drum not rotating)

Either you have not powered the photoscan up, or you have not turned
the drum on. See node SET-UP.

When PS is ready for commands, it will type a "*".

11/40 START-UP PROCEDURES: 

Since much of the photoscan program runs on the PDP11/40 (located 
in the same room as the photoscan), it must be running before
the PS program can be called on ITS.
The easiest way to find out if it is running is to
try to start up the PS program on ITS (see node: PS START-UP).
If the 11/40 is not running (or is in use) it will tell you so,
and you should then return to this section. 

The procedure for bootstrapping the 11/40 is as follows:

1. Verify that no one else is using the 11/40. If there is someone
sitting at the 11/45 console (GT40) ask him, as 11/45 users
sometimes use the 11/40 in conjunction with their 11/45 programs.
Also, check that the photowriter and photoscanner are not already
in use (both should be powered off, unless you just turned the
photoscan on yourself). If the photowriter or photoscanner drum
is rotating and the lights are blinking, DON'T proceed to step 2.

2. The 11/40 should have power (manifested by red L.E.D.'s showing
on the front panel). If it does not, you will have to power up the
11/45 (the two machines are on one power switch) by rotating the
three-position rotary switch on the 11/45 front panel from the
OFF to the POWER position. You need do nothing else to the 11/45.

3. On the 11/40 front panel, press the ENABLE/HALT switch
down (to HALT), then lift it up (to ENABLE).

4. Place the number 173000 in the 11/40 switch register.
(Chances are it is already there: all switches down except
15, 14, 13, 12, 10 and 9.) 

5. Press LOAD ADDRESS. (It will pop back up.)

6. Press START (it too will pop up), and you're ready to go.

THE PS COMMAND INTERPRETER:

    When waiting for a command, the PS program will prompt you
with a "*". Any time this "*" is present, you may type "?"<CR>
to get a list of available commands, or you may type a two-letter
command. If the command takes no arguments, you are done. If the
command requires arguments, you may enter them on the same line
as the command, separated by a space (and second and additional
arguments may be separated by spaces or commas). Most commands
that take arguments require numeric arguments. These may be
typed in as any combination of an integer part and up to two
decimal places (more decimal places will be ignored, however),
as for example: 231, 7.2, 2.11, 0.11, .11.

Coordinates are always entered in cms.

    You may also type a <CR> after the command, even though
the command requires arguments and you have omitted them. The
interpreter will ask you for the arguments it needs, and you may then
enter them one at a time, each one terminated by a <CR>. 
In this mode, the INTERPRETER will tell you what the default
is for that argument. Typing just a <CR> will enter the default
value for that argument.

    You may choose to use all the default settings for all the
arguments to a particular command by typing "^" on the
command line instead of a first argument.

    Some commands require a file specification as an argument.
If you type just a <CR> to one of these, it will type "#"
and wait for the file specification, but you may enter the
file specification on the same line as the command, just as
with numeric arguments.

EXAMPLES:

*PI
*ER 4
*ER
Resolution (default is 1.00) ? 4
*SC 3.45, 2.2, 7, 4
*SC ^
*OF MAB;PHOTO GRAY1
*WN OUTFIL >

See the next node, COMMANDS, for details of the arguments to
the particular PS commands.


file: PS,  node: COMMANDS,  up: TOP,  previous: INTERPRETER

This node is the command list for the PS program. Each command
will be a subnode, with a more detailed discussion of the command
and examples of that particular command contained in the subnode.

Functionally, the PS program is arranged so that the scanning
process divides into three stages: 1. opening the output file
onto which the scanned picture will be written  2. setting switches
and parameters in the program which affect the way the picture will
be scanned, and  3. scanning the picture. Scanning is accomplished
by means of one command, SP (scan picture). All other commands
may be used to change parameters of the as yet unscanned image,
or to inspect the current settings, without actually scanning the
image.


* Menu:			these are the available commands

Stage 1: opening the output file

* OF::			open file for output

Stage 2: manipulating the scan parameters

* SC::			scan coordinates. Specify the coordinates
			of the image to be scanned

* NI::			scan a "negative image" (0 = clear film or white paper)
* PI::			scan a "positive image" (0 = black film or paper)
* ER::			enter resolution
* BP::			enter the number of bits per pixel (normally 8)
* BT::			enter the binary threshold (only when bits/pixel = 1)

Stage 3: scanning the picture

* SP::			scan the picture

Miscellaneous support commands

* DP::			display the picture just scanned (TV's only)
* ST::			print the settings in effect
* PC::			print the currently selected scan coordinates
* DI::			disown the PS job when the next SP is begun
* WN::			wallpaper on. Start up a wallpaper file
* WF::			wallpaper off. Close wallpaper file
* EB::			enter batch mode
* EX::			exit from PS program


file: PS,  node: OF,  next: SC,  up: COMMANDS


COMMAND OF -- open a file for output


The OF command takes as its one argument an ITS file
specification, which may be entered in-line or on
a separate line (in which case, a "#" prompt character
will be printed). The file specified will be opened for
output, although nothing will be written into it until
an "SP" command is executed. The file may already exist,
in which case the old file will be deleted.

EXAMPLE: 

*OF USER;PICT >
*OF

#PICT GREY1


file: PS,  node: SC,  next: NI,  up: COMMANDS,  previous: OF


COMMAND SC -- set scan coordinates

SC takes as arguments the coordinates which delimit the
area of film to be scanned. 

Four arguments are expected: X0,Y0,X1,Y1. (X0,Y0) is the
lower left-hand corner of the rectangle to be scanned, and
(X1,Y1) is the upper right corner. 

PS imposes margins. Attempting to set either Y0 or Y1 to less
than .15 will cause it to be set to .15 (this will show up
in the PC, ST, and SP messages). A similar limit is imposed
upon X, but is raster dependent and ranges from .16 to .64.

EXAMPLE:

*SC 2, 2, 3.4, 4.5	; scans a 1.4 by 2.5 cm. rectangle 
			; starting at (2,2)



file: PS,  node: NI,  next: PI,  up: COMMANDS,  previous: SC


COMMAND NI -- scan a negative image


This command is the default condition and thus has no effect
unless the image has already been reversed once by executing
the "PI" command. Negative images have datum 0 = clear film
or white paper, and datum 255 = black film or paper.
(The name "negative image" comes from the fact that VIDICON
and PIN-DIODE camera pictures have datum 0 = black).

NI takes no arguments.


file: PS,  node: PI,  next: ER,  up: COMMANDS,  previous: NI


COMMAND PI -- scan a positive image


This command causes black points to be 0 and white paper or
clear film to be 255. PI is the inverse of NI.

PI takes no arguments.


file: PS,  node: ER,  next: BP,  up: COMMANDS,  previous: PI


COMMAND ER -- enter resolution


ER takes one argument, the resolution. This integer serves to
reduce the resolution of the scan, by causing pixels in each
line and lines in the scan to be skipped. Setting the
resolution to n causes one line to be scanned out of each n
lines (n-1 lines are skipped) and similarly, one pixel out of
each n pixels is scanned. Resolutions greater than 1 are used
to scan a large area without producing a corresponding large
disk file (the disk file will be 1/n*n times the size it would be
with resolution 1).

It may also be desirable to use a smaller raster than otherwise
and a corresponding increase in the resolution. Scanning
a given area of film with raster 100 resolution 1 produces
the same size disk file as scanning the same region with raster
25 resolution 4; the latter approach has the advantage of sharpening
up features which are at least 100 microns across (because the
100 micron raster setting averages over the 100 micron region).
However, this approach will cause features which are less than 100 microns
across to be missed entirely.

EXAMPLE:

*ER 3


file: PS,  node: BP,  next: BT,  up: COMMANDS,  previous: ER


COMMAND BP -- bits per pixel


Command BP takes one integer argument, the number of bits per pixel
in the image file. This defaults to 8, as the photoscan produces
8 bits per pixel. Asking for more than 8 bits per pixel will cause
additional zero bits to be added on the right (least significant
bits). Asking for less than 8 bits per pixel will cause bits
to be shifted off the right (sacrificing the least significant
bits). Making BP less than 8 is a convenient way to save on
disk space without sacrificing spatial resolution.

BP 1 is a special case, that of a binary picture. When 1 bit
per pixel has been selected, the shifting algorithm described
above is abandoned in favor of a special case check of each
8 bit datum coming from the photoscan against a user-selectable
threshold. The default for this user threshold is 128, but
it may be changed by use of the BT command.

EXAMPLE:

*BP 4


file: PS,  node: BT,  next: SP,  up: COMMANDS,  previous: BP


COMMAND BT -- binary threshold


The BT command takes one integer argument, the binary
threshold. BT has no effect if the next
scan is done with any setting of bits/pixel other than 1.
If bits/pixel is 1, then data from the photoscan is compared
with the binary threshold, and data which is less than
the threshold will become 0 and data which is greater than
the threshold will become 1.

EXAMPLE:

*BT 200


file: PS,  node: SP,  next: ST,  up: COMMANDS,  previous: BT


COMMAND SP -- scan picture


Command SP causes the photoscan to scan a picture in accordance
with the parameters in core which have been set up by the
commands listed above. Before beginning the scan, SP will
print out a one-line summary of the scan about to be performed,
and will ask for user confirmation. This status line is of the
form

USER;FILE NAME   (bbb blocks)  Rn +/-I a.aa-b.bb,c.cc-d.dd  CONFIRM?

where:

USER;FILE NAME   is the name of the file currently open for output.
bbb blocks       is the length that file will be, in blocks
Rn               is the resolution
+/-I             is whether the image will be negative (NI)
	         or positive (PI)
a.aa-b.bb	 is the area the scan will cover, in X (e.g. a.aa
		 will be the starting x, and b.bb will be the final X
c.cc-d.dd	 is the area of scan in Y.


To cause the scan to occur, this may be confirmed by typing "Y".
Typing any other character will abort this instance of the SP
command, leave all the photoscan settings unchanged and leave
the current output file still open.

Once the scan begins, the program will print the length of time
the scan will take in minutes, and then will keep an updated
indication of the progress of the scan (% complete).

SP takes no arguments.



file: PS,  node: DP,  next: ST,  up: COMMANDS,  previous: SP


COMMAND DP -- display picture


Command DP displays the picture just scanned on the
TV screen using BKPH's pseudo-grey level display program
GREY (see LIBVIS;IMAGE NEWS for more details on GREY).

DP will not work if you are not on a TV terminal, or if you
have not just scanned a picture.

DP will cause the picture to be magnified by the largest
integer which will still allow it to fit on the TV
screen. If the picture is too big for the TV screen even
with no enlargement, then a subset of the picture will
be displayed which includes the lower left hand corner.

DP takes no arguments.


file: PS,  node: ST,  next: PC,  up: COMMANDS,  previous: DP


COMMAND ST -- print photoscan settings


Command ST prints the current settings of the phtoscan,
such as RASTER, RESOLUTION, bits/pixel, binary threshold,
output file name, coordinate range, and positive/negative
parity of the image.

ST takes no arguments.


file: PS,  node: PC,  next: DI,  up: COMMANDS,  previous: ST


COMMAND PC  -- print coordinates


Command PC prints the coordinate range on the film of the
area which is currently selected for scanning.

PC is a subset of ST. PC takes no arguments.



file: PS,  node: DI,  next: WN,  up: COMMANDS, previous: PC

COMMAND DI -- disown

The command DI causes the PS job to disown itself as soon
as the next SP command is confirmed. Once a job is disowned,
the terminal may be used for other purposes, or the user
can log off entirely, and the photoscan job will run
to conclusion. Ordinarily this means finishing the picture
it is working on, but if the DI appears as part of a
batch stream, many pictures may be photoscanned with the
job disowned (see command EB). The user, of course, has no
idea what happens after the job is disowned, although he
can create a wallpaper file (see command WN) to document
the details of the photoscan protocol, even though it
is disowned.

To check on the status of a disowned job, do a peek
(:P), find the PS job in your job tree, and take note
of its index number (IDX). Then run peek as follows:
:P <index number>J<CR>. This will tell you the name of
the picture file PS is reading, and the number of blocks
which have been written.

DI takes no arguments.



file: PS,  node: WN,  next: WF,  up: COMMANDS,  previous: DI

COMMAND WN -- wallpaper on.

WN starts a wallpaper file. A wallpaper file is a disk file
which contains all the characters PS types at you and all
the characters you type at PS. If the photoscan job has
been disowned (see command DI), a wallpaper file tells you
what happened while you weren't there.

WN takes as its argument the file specification for the
wallpaper file, which may be entered in-line or on a
separate line (after the "#").

If you attempt to open a file which already exists, the old
version of the file will be deleted.

EXAMPLES:

*WN WALL PAPER
*WN

#USER;WALL PAPER


file: PS,  node: WF,  next: EB,  up: COMMANDS,  previous: WN

COMMAND WF -- wallpaper off

WF turns off output to the wallpaper file, and closes the file.
It takes no arguments.



file: PS,  node: EB,  next: EX,  up: COMMANDS,  previous: WF

COMMAND EB -- enter batch mode.

In batch mode, characters are taken from a batch "stream"
whenever PS wants user input, instead of being typed from
the keyboard. The batch stream can be a disk file, or 
a series of characters typed in at the keyboard all at
once before batch mode is entered. In either case, the 
batch stream should contain exactly those characters which
would have been typed by the user.

Of course, this requires that all the program's needs be
anticipated lest errors occur and become compounded.
It gives the user the ability to start a batch job which
will do several pictures without requiring his intervention.
Batch jobs are especially useful when you intend to disown
the PS job. Several photoscan pictures can be done
even after you've logged out!

There is one exception to the rule that the batch file or
stream need contain every character that would have been
typed at the keyboard: the SP command does not need
confirmation if it is called in batch mode.

If errors do occur in batch mode, the picture associated
with the error will not be scanned, but the remainder
of the batch stream will be processed. The user will be
notified each time a picture is skipped due to errors.

EXAMPLE:

*EB

Enter name of batch file, or type <CR> to enter batch stream manually

#USER;BATCH FILE

*DI
*WN WALL >
*OF PICT 1
*ER 3
*SC 4.5, 2.0, 6, 3.5
*SP
*OF PICT 2
*ER 3
*SC 7.5, 2.0, 9, 3.5
*SP
*WF



file: PS,  node: EX,  up: COMMANDS,  previous: EB


COMMAND EX -- exit


EX exits from the PS program and causes the PS job to be :KILL'ed.
It also bootstraps the 11/40, so that it will be ready for the next
user.
