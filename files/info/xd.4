	XD is a program for editing files which are meant to be printed
on the XGP.  XD inputs a file in XGP image format, such as the output of PUB
of TJ6, or any test file, and displays it on your TV terminal.  It knows
about everything the XGP does, such as font specifications, which it gets
form the ;KSET command in the file.
	The main problem in such a program is that the resolution of a TV
is much lower than that of the XGP.  To deal with this problem, the program
has two modes.  In the first of these, the normal mode, XD
keeps track of a window, whose position can be controlled by the user.
The window shows about one fifth of a page vertically, and one third of a
page horizontally.  There are commands to move the page with respect to
the window.
	In the "Mini-display" mode, the entire physical page is displayed
on the TV screen, compressed by a factor of 4 horizontally, and by 5
vertically.  In this mode the page is shown with very low resolution.
The dots are ORed together, so the mini-display gives a good idea of the
overall layout of the page.

	Currently implemented commands are:

	N	Go to the next physical XGP page.
	H	Home the window to the upper left-hand corner of the screen.
	C	Center the window at the physical center of the page.
	Q	Quit.
	R	Redisplay the screen in normal mode.
	M	Mini-display.  Redisplay the screen in low resolution mode.
	nA	Advance n pages ahead in the file. 1A is the same as N.
	nP	Display page n.
	?	Type a list of commands.

	[	Move the page to the left.
	]	Move the page to the right.
	\	Move the page up.
	/	Move the page down.

The last four commands were chosen for their convenient physical location
on the keyboards of TV's, as they are in the DRAW program.  These four
commands can be multiplied, also like the DRAW program.  The multiplication
works as follows:

	CTRL	Multiply by 2
	META	Multiply by 4
	TOP	Multiply by 16

So CTRL-[ moves the page twice as far to the left, CTRL-TOP-/ moves it
16 times as far down, etc.  Since this makes it easy to get lost, the H and C
commands can be used to get the window back on the page.

	The page motion commands and the R command switch the program into
normal mode, and the M command switches it to display mode.  The N,P, and A
commands do not affect the mode.

	The XGP format file to be read in can be given as JCL, or the program
will ask for it.
	As of now, it does not know about the ;SIZE command.

	If you find a file which produces a bug, please :BUG XD about them,
explain the bug, and tell me where I can find an exact copy of the file
which produced it.  Any bugs left in the program may take very specialized
conditions in order to show itself.

	Please send any comments, suggestions, bugs, etc., to BUG-XD.
