;;; This is how incremental search manages to allow both type-ahead and rubout-ahead:

;;; Input of normal characters pushes onto the end using index P,
;;; and rubout pops off at the same index.  *IS-REVERSE-P* remembers the
;;; search direction at each level, *IS-OPERATION* remembers the type of search
;;; (:NORMAL for a normal character, :REVERSE for a R or S that reverses,
;;; or :REPEAT for a R or S that repeats), *IS-POINTER* is the length of
;;; the search string at that level.

;;; In parallel, with lower priority, the entries thus pushed are processed
;;; by searching according to them.  P1 is the index of the entry or "level"
;;; which is currently being worked on.  P1 advances only when the level is
;;; determined to be successful or failing.  Advancing involves examining the three
;;; *IS-...* entries of the next level to see what to do.  If P1 meets P, then there is no
;;; work to do for the moment.  The state of this process is kept in *IS-STATUS*
;;; and *IS-BP*.  *IS-BP* is the bp of the place found at a given level or the 
;;; place at which searching is going on.  *IS-STATUS* is T for a successful search,
;;; NIL for a failing one, and :GO if it isn't known yet.  New levels are pushed
;;; (via P) in the :GO state.

;;; Rubbing out decrements P1 if necessary to keep it no greater than P.
;;; The searching process is not confused because it keeps all its state
;;; in *IS-STATUS* and *IS-BP* and all that is needed is to change P1.

;;; Updating the echo area is under input in priority, but above actual searching.
;;; Thus, as soon as there is no type-ahead everything will be correct.
;;; This is because the echo area is presumed to be fast to update.
;;; Buffer redisplay is lower than searching, of course.
