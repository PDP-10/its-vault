Many of you on this list do not work in relativity but if
some of your colleagues have used MACSYMA for relativity
applications please forward the following to them:

Lars Hornfeldt and his colleagues at Stockholm would like
to get together a list of papers for the 10th International
Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation this July
in Padova. The papers are to be those which have used MACSYMA
for General Relativity and I am trying to collect them for
Hornfeldt. If you have published any, or if you have any in 
preprint form, send them or the references to me. 

Thanks.

   [1] why did  loadfile(etensr,fasl,dsk,share)
   not load as macsyma manual says it should? What do I do?
The manual was written before the current Multics Macsyma even existed.
On Multics you can get the package which is now called "ctensr" by doing:
	loadfile(">udd>Mathlab>macsyma>share>ctensr.lisp");

   [2] Following macsyma reference manual, p.191-192, I typed tsetup(),
   but only got the reply	tsetup()
   rather than what the manual shows.
On Multics you have to do the loadfile listed in [1] above before typing 
tsetup();.

        No, it is just called itensr.  
        If you do "cwd >udd>Mathlab>Macsyma>share"
        (or just "cwd >udd>mal>a>share"), then you can type "list" to list the
        contents of the directory.  (Of course this is less obvious than typing
        control-F, but what can you do with a loser like Multics.)
    I tried LOADFILE(">udd>Mathlab>macsyma>share>itensr") and this is ok. Then
    BATCH(">udd>Mathlab>macsyma>share>itensr.demo1") etc bombs out because
    each ITENSR demo has a command to LOADFILE(ITENSR,FASL). Can you edit this
    line out of each demo or tell me how to do it?
---------------------------------
I edited a copy of each demo file here on MC and retransferred them to Multics.
Now, when I attempt to demo these files, they appear to work until (for
demo1, e.g.) up to the line 

CANFORM(EXP);

at which point it gets an error:

lisp:function allfiles rejected argument ((dsk tensor) symtry fasl)

which I gather means we need to transfer (and compile) some more files.

No, that's a different bug.  The installed Macsyma doesn't know about
macsyma-module, so running interpreted system code won't work.  Try loading

One possibility is to request ARPAnet access (or Chaos net access...
that is our local MIT net and I believe Multics is now connected to
it) to MC to go along with your Multics account and use MC from a
"supdup" connection from Multics.  The connection (being through
Telenet to Multics then through ARPA or Chaos net to MC) will probably
be somewhat "slow" and perhaps frustrating from the "user
input/output" point of view, but of course the Tensor package would
then work for you, and you could probably do any preparation of batch
files or whatever on Multics and only make use of an interactive port
to MC to do the actual calculation.  You would have to contact the
Information Processing Services to arrange this.  If they have any
questions about it, you can refer them to me.

I ran some more tests and the CTENSR demos run on MULTICS though
this example of Unruh's bombs. The problem occurs when ANY metric 
is direct input (as opposed to the demos where the user does not
type them). I have no idea where the problem lies.

    I have put CURVATURE alphabetically, which places it between COVDIFF
    and DIFF.  I myself wonder if (since there is an index) you might want
    to consider reordering the functions more by "use", if there is any
    sort of progression there... it is a very minor point, so if you don't
    care we will leave things as they are, but to me for instance it would
    seem natural to have DIFF and COVDIFF together, and have CURVATURE
    (even if it were named RIEMANN and thus came later in the alphabet) just
    before GEODESIC, since they appear (to my casual glance) to be related.
    Anyone needing the page of a precise function probably isn't going to
    be making use of the fact they are alphabetical, but rather using the
    index.
I do not think this would be useful here. Clearly, for a users manual it

the same size. GJC's looks very good for the 4 tests below. LHS's version
bombed out for the 4th demo but was equivalent to GJC's wrt time

this version should replace the FASSAVE. I will wait a few days
