No, that's the USR: device.  But they've invented the JOB: device too,
something called "portals" I think.

As Noel Chiappa said when talking about ITS and Multics, it's really
kind of scary to think that we are just now catching up to what we
were able to do twenty years ago.

I read the following in the Usenet newsgroup comp.unix.wizards (== to

Several people have asked what this is about, so I suppose I should elaborate
a bit.  This stuff has been presented in papers at Usenix conferences, but
not everybody's familiar with those.

/proc is V8's replacement for the ptrace() system call and related things.
It's a slightly-odd type of file system.  Once mounted, it looks like a
single directory containing a bunch of files with numeric names.  If you
open (say) file "12345", you are looking at the address space of process
number 12345.  Writes into the file are writes into the address space.
There are ioctls for things like stopping and starting the process, sending
it signals, etc.  Access to the files is naturally subject to the standard
Unix file-permission system.  The whole thing is actually a figment of the
kernel's imagination, with the "directory" manufactured on the fly whenever
someone tries to read it, and operations on the "files" turned into the
corresponding operations on the processes.  Apart from being cleaner than
ptrace(), /proc is also faster.

[description of /n/face deleted]

In both cases, these odd filesystems look exactly like real ones, down to
things like "." and ".." entries in the directories.  You can use all the
standard Unix tools to operate on them.

At least one System V implementation of /proc exists inside AT&T, but it
hasn't made it into any released software that I know of.  I believe /n/face
is strictly a V8ism at the moment.

When this challenge was originally posted, Census data was mentioned.
Well, although it may not be the winner, the Census Bureau puts up a
good fight.  Here are the high points:

1920 Census Data was originally tabulated on Hollerith cards, but those
probably no longer exist.  1920 records are on microfilm (which I assume
doesn't qualify).  However, some of it is available on tape (see below).

The 1950 Census used a Univac I (I think) to count the population.  Data
from this census was originally written to Univac metal tape.  Some of
these tapes still exist, but it's unclear whether or not the bits on
them are still readable.

The 1960 Census used FOSDIC (Form Optical Scanner Direct Input to
Computer, or something like that) to convert all the forms to microfilm,
and then to bits.  These tapes still exist.

So it looks like 1950 (which wasn't tabulated until 1954 or so) or 1960
is the best bet.  However, you can get from the Census Bureau tapes
containing data summaries for each Census since 1920.  These are 1%
samples of the population, which don't contain any personal data, just
averages.  However, some of the numbers are from 1920, so I guess that's
"maintained data."

I just saw an old file creation date on AI, which led to the following thought:

	Those bits are "still around", despite the fact that the hardware
	they live on wasn't invented at the time the bits were written.

Which leads to a question:

	What is the oldest "continuously maintained" set of bits in the 
	computer universe?

Does Grace Hopper still have artillery aiming data on her Macintosh?  Did the
Census Department copy their punched cards from the 1920 census onto CD/ROM?
By continously maintained, I mean that the data has been used regularly since
its creation, or at least kept around on some form of reasonably
random-access memory in the hope or expectation that it would be used.  Thus,
the sine lookup table diode ROM in the artillery aiming machine doesn't count
if the machine doesn't still work, but AI:SYSEN2;PRUFD > does, even though it
hasn't actually been assembled in 15 years or so, and the object code hasn't
been run in 2.  And of course, by data I'm referring to "digital" information.
Rosetta stones, Dead Sea scrolls and Enrico Caruso records don't count, but
the first stock ticker tape might.

Any interesting candidates?  Send me your votes.  (The file mentioned above
dates from 28 February 1971, and is the oldest file on AI whose creation
date is believable.)

I was in the mood for a little hack, so I wrote one.  (Source on
SYSNET;REDRCT.)  Try out:

  :ALAN;REDRCT

(If anyone can think of a good directory for this to live on other than
ALAN, let me know.)  With no JCL it will remind you of its usage as
follows:

Usage is:

  :REDRCT <old gateway> <optional new gateway>

Gateways can be given as hostnames, or in decimal octet form (as in
"10.0.0.77").  If the new gateway is omitted, REDRCT will simply pick a
likely-looking gateway from ITS's list of main gateways.

REDRCT will ask for confirmation once after it interprets its command, to be
sure it properly understood what you asked it to do.  Then for each routing
table entry it finds that uses the old gateway, it will ask for confirmation
before clobbering it with the new gateway.

	You know, I wish there were some tools to manipulate this
table. For instance, the main gateway to a net went down, and
I wanted to switch to the backup; however, ITS doesn't discover
dead gateway, and you have to make the switch manually. There's
no tool to do this; I had to grovel in IPGWTN: for the right
netry (after doing the conversion to octal) and bash it by hand
(it picked up the right gateway from a Redirect, so it wasn't
totally by hand). Still, some command that could delete routes,
or modify the entyry, could be a real win.

The forget-to-free-the-SYN-packet problem than happens on AI and MC so
much, really -does- also happen on the KL!  After 12 days running, the KL
has managed to lose just two packets in this manner.  Perhaps the fact that
the KL is so much faster explains why it happens so rarely there?

Hi.  I was reading some of the old BUG-ITS mail and saw some messages
about power fail recovery.  Forget about it on the KS10.  Although it
was originally going to be included (and I think the prototype machine
had it), production KS's don't have any battery backup for the MS10
memory.  Since MS10 is MOS based, once the power goes it gets nuked.

The best thing ITS can do is with a power fail interrupt is to quiet
down any disk traffic as quickly as possible (certainly nuke all reads
and any writes that aren't essential to prevent filesystem damage) and
halt.

Since KS10 power supplies are made by a real vendor and not DEC, KS's
don't see trivial little glitches.  The power has to be off for some
time, something like 250ms, for a KS to croak.  My KS has survived
power glitches that reset the digital clocks and zapped the TV!  So,
if you get a power fail interrupt there is a good chance that the
disks are already in the process of shutdown.

Incidentally, the Computer Museum already has a PDP-6 -- we gave them
ours.  At the time I thought that it was the only one left in the world.
We recently killed our KA10 and sold it to a collector for $500, including

I am involved peripherally with this project.

There is NO attempt to shortchange or ignore ITS, WAITS, and TENEX.

But!!  We will need *papers* from people in these communities in order to
fairly cover these operating systems.

Otherwise, I will write up something really brief.  For ITS, in a few short
paragraphs I'll talk about DDT as the command decoder, PCLSR'ing, and the
environment that led to the creation of EMACS.

I think such coverage WOULD shortchange ITS.  There are lots of important
concepts that can and should be discussed in detail -- PCLSR'ing, ITS virtual
memory (not as good as TOPS-20/Tenex, but quite advanced for its time),
canonical terminals/SUPDUP/CRTSTY, symbolic system calls, CHEOPS, Knight TV
system, ...

TECO and TECO-based editors should be a paper in itself.

The following message was forwarded to me (it was originally sent to AIList
I think) with the suggestion that I should redistribute it to whatever
mailing lists of PDP-10 hackers I knew of.  I don't know anything more
about this than what is revealed here.

It does kind of sound like these guys are planning on writing a history of
PDP-10's that only mentions TOPS10 and TOPS20 and fails to consider ITS and
WAITS and perhaps shortchanges TENEX.  But I suspect that this is merely a
shortcoming of this announcement.

Subject: Announcement of the DEC 10 and PDP-6 history project (PROJECT-10262)

This message originates from 2 sources:

The goal of this project is to publish an analysis and history of
the evolution, implementation and use of Digital's 36 bit systems.
This period began with the PDP-6 in 1964 and continues today with
TOPS 10/20 development, which is scheduled to end in 1988.

We are working aggressively to finish the project, and have it
published, by March/April 1988.  This will require that the
completed manuscript be ready to go into the publication cycle
by August 1987!

The project will attempt to answer the following questions:

	1. In what markets/applications were these systems used?

	2. Who were the users of these systems and what impact did
	   roughly 2,500 TOPS 10/20 systems have on their organizations?

	3. Who were the principle system architects of these systems?
	   What features, and if there had been sufficient time to
	   implement them, would have significantly improved the
	   architecture?

	4. What impact did the decision to continue to examine design
	   extensions to the architecture have on the usefulness and
	   acceptability of these systems.  This is in contrast to a
	   more common practice today to work from a detailed design
	   specification, sometimes dated, building follow-on systems
	   which provide increased performance through the use of new
	   component technologies and packaging techniques.

	5. What part of the overall design (TOPS10/20) was technology
	   dependent and what can still be considered "unequaled" in
	   relation to other computer architectures still undergoing
	   active development?

	6. What type of development environment (both HW and SW)
	   supported and contributed to the evolution of 36 bit
	   systems?

	7. What influence did TOPS 10/20 have on other vendors system
	   development?

This history will undoubtedly be assembled from many sources and
participants.  Some information will be anecdotal; there will be
interviews with the people involved (users and developers) and technical
papers will be solicited.  Of course there will also be the packaging
and assembly of facts as we see them.

The result will hopefully have sufficient depth to serve as:

	1. An introductory or advanced text on system design and
	   hardware/system software implementation.

	2. A analysis of the success and difficulties of marketing
	   complex systems into a very crowded market of competing
	   alternatives.

	3. A catharsis for those of us who have contributed to the
	   development and use these systems and who will now move
	   onto new computing architectures and opportunities.

In addition to interviewing directly 25-50 developers, users and
product managers we will continue to work to identify contributors
and significant events up to when the final draft is submitted to
the publisher.  Two "topics" are already under development:

	1. Rob Gingell from SUN is working on a paper which looks
	   at extensions to TOPS 20 which would have enhanced its
	   capabilities.

	2. Frank da Cruz and Columbia are summarizing 10 years of
	   experience and development of TOPS 20 systems.  Some
	   effort will also be made to detail the process which
	   lead to their selection of a follow-on architecture to
	   TOPS 20.

There is a need to develop additional topics which represent the
use and application of the technology (TOPS 10/20) in other areas.
Specific recommendations are welcome as are proposals to develop
them.  A short abstract should accompany any such proposal.  Every
effort will be made to work with individuals or organizations
interested in making such a contribution.

There will be a standalone (no network connections) DECSYSTEM 2020
(YIPYIP) dedicated to supporting the project.  This system has a 3
line hunt group, with all lines accessible from a single number
(201.874.8612).

Both YIPYIP and MARKET will have "public" directories for remote
login (<log>DEMPSTER.PROJECT-10262 <Password>LCGLCG).  MARKET can
be accessed by modem (617.467.7437), however disk quota is limited.
MARKET's primary purpose <DEMPSTER.PROJECT-10262> is ARPAnet TELNET
access.  YIPYIP is a dedicated PROJECT-10262 system.  MAIL can also
be sent to DEMPSTER on either system.

YIPYIP and MARKET will keep a running summary of ideas and comments
up on Columbia's BBOARD software.  KERMIT also runs on each system
for uploads.

SAIL.STANFORD.EDU will support ARPAnet transfers to a "public" area:

	FTP<ret>
	CONNECT SAIL.STANFORD.EDU<ret>
	SEND AFN.EXT<ret>
	DSK: AFN.EXT [PUB,LES]<ret>

SAIL runs WAITS, an operating system similiar to TOPS 10.  File
names are limited to 6 characters and extensions limited to 3.


Implementation details:

	1. User input is welcomed and desired from all application
	   and geographic areas.

	2. Input from past and present developers is also desired.

	3. Throughout the project a secondary goal will be to build
	   a list of users/locations (installation date, duration and
	   disposition) of PDP-6 and KA, KI, KL and KS systems.
	   Serial numbers, if available, are requested.

	4. We anticipate that this project will generate a large
	   volume of information (which we hope will arrive
	   electronically).  Some information, for any number of
	   reasons, may not be in line with the project's stated
	   goals.  Therefore, all notes, interview material and
	   submissions will be donated to the Computer Museum in Boston
	   at the the completion of the project to be available for
	   future reference and research.

Ideas, contributions, suggestions and criticism are welcome.  As these
36 bit systems were the products of a multitude of people, so too
will be the writing of their history.

INFO-ITS is, of course, a mailing list, but it is not used for regular
mail.  it follows the original fashion of lists named INFO-x, being a very
large list used only for announcements of general interest and importance
to the ITS community -- for instance, major changes in the system.  you
should not send mail to it. i will add you to it (if no one else has yet),
but don't expect more than one or two msgs a year to be sent.  BUG-ITS or
one of the more specific ITS-related lists is probably the right list for
your various questions.

as to CAMEXEC, yes, it is an ITS-emulating system, written by ED@AI. he
can give you lots of information about it.

ITS is more or less public domain. however, there is no regular
distribution system; each ITS kit is custom-made. for one thing, in the
current scheme of things, each ITS in the world needs a unique two-letter
ID, assigned here so it can be included in some of the deep internals.  so
we are not inclined to scatter ITS kits at random. if you get a KS, and
want such a kit, the correct list to correspond with is KS-ITS@AI.

for info on ITS, you should start by looking into the :INFO program and
reading what it has to offer.

Yow! Anyway, what I was going to say when the message cleverly decided to
send itself was that the second TCP buffer problem (which is the more
serious - the SYN problem loses packets slowly over time, but when the
IMP problem hits you have had it) is due to my driver code's apparent
inability to always recover correctly from a dropped ACC interrupt.

I haven't had a chance to look at the SYN problem yet, but given what
we learned from Dave's stuff it should be fairly easy to find.

    Another approach would be to modify PEEK (or something else) to look at the
    buffers, including those not on any list.  The contents might give
    you a clue -- perhaps they are all from a particular host, or use a
    particular protocol, or all have the SYN or FIN bit set, etc.

I did that a month or two ago.  I don't remember any more what I found out,
except that there were a large number of buffers queued for transmission and
the IMP wasn't taking them.  But I don't remember what was in them.  We still
have the crash dumps and :p <filename <return> ? should say what the new mode is
(1A I think).

I guess it wasn't announced to Bug-ITS when Moon put a mode into PEEK for
looking at TCP buffers (type "1A").  After using this mode on running
systems and crash dumps it appears that the lost packets are always SYN
packets with their Retransmit flag set.  JTW points out that the only
effect of a bug that causes retransmission of SYNs to get dropped would be
that opening connections would time-out more frequently than they should.
This doesn't address the issue of why the problem only seems to happen on
the KS's and never on the KL.

One approach for finding out where the buffers are going might be to
look at the various meters.  If you find a meter which has a count the
same as (or close to) the number of buffers that are "lost", then you've
found something.

Another approach would be to modify PEEK (or something else) to look at the
buffers, including those not on any list.  The contents might give
you a clue -- perhaps they are all from a particular host, or use a
particular protocol, or all have the SYN or FIN bit set, etc.

Considering the remarkable things that have already been discovered
with respect to .HANG and LOCKS, surely yet another long standing
mystery will shortly come to light.

    After reading the following bug report [not included], you will realize
    that this reveals a bug in the way jobs are sometimes killed when they
    have locks locked.  If you -first- clobbering their PC's to point to a
    .LOGOUT in location 0, and only the .LOGOUT then checks to see if the
    PC is in the critical routine table, then the critical routine table is
    worthless...

I fixed the lock unlocking stuff to always use the correct PC, so .GUNing
somebody when he is in a critical region should now do the right thing.  I
didn't do anything to prevent lock unlocking instructions from clobbering
the location that contains the .LOGOUT.

This drive is not on service contract, and neither AI nor presumably LCS

to get this fixed when it happened to one of AI's drives.

It seems it ought to be possible to detect which drives are offline at
boot time; Twenex does this, perhaps DSKDMP or ITS could just zap QACT
when it sees that a drive is offline?

While we're adding twenexisms, how about automatic crash dumps and
automatic proceed or reload when there isn't a hacker on duty? :-)

    In theory there is a bit that the 8080 sets to indicate that this
    is an auto-boot.  DSKDMP could test that bit and always load .;@
    ITS.  Then it could set some kind of a flag to tell DDT to
    immediately $G and then start it.

    Then we would have to change all of our habits about disk drives
    being offline, because we would always need to patch QACT in the
    binary as well as the running system.

This is reasonable.  We could get rid of that crufty ITS/NITS/XITS
naming randomness too (what's wrong with a link?).

    Then we have to figure out what to do about setting the time.
    After a power-glitch, a KS-10 will -always- forget the time.
    Getting the time from the network simply doesn't work.  (This
    afternoon when AI and MC asked for the time from the network, only
    -one- host responded to their query.  I'm kind of reluctant to set
    the time on the basis of a single answer.)

I still have that clock that didn't get installed because I/we
couldn't figure out which protocol was the best and what machine to
put it on.  Why not put it on MC?  I've been watching it for the last
several months and it keeps time better than my watch (which is what
we use otherwise, right?)

    Or is it, for some reason beyond my ken, considered a feature that ITS
    needs a human to reboot?

Well, booting the system without human assistance just makes me a little
nervous, but we could think about it:

In theory there is a bit that the 8080 sets to indicate that this is an
auto-boot.  DSKDMP could test that bit and always load .;@ ITS.  Then it
could set some kind of a flag to tell DDT to immediately $G and then start
it.

Then we would have to change all of our habits about disk drives being
offline, because we would always need to patch QACT in the binary as well
as the running system.

Then we have to figure out what to do about setting the time.  After a
power-glitch, a KS-10 will -always- forget the time.  Getting the time from
the network simply doesn't work.  (This afternoon when AI and MC asked for
the time from the network, only -one- host responded to their query.  I'm
kind of reluctant to set the time on the basis of a single answer.)

Yeah, "BT AUTO" is what the 8080 front-end types when it decides to
automatically boot the machine after the machine is powered on.  For ITS
the boot routine just loads up DSKDMP and starts it, which is presumably
how you found the machine.  Since the boot routine zeros core before
loading DSKDMP (it does this to wipe out potential parity errors), your
crash dump contains nothing more than the boot routine itself.  Thanks for
tending to the problem!

Right, that's a powerglitch.  The power fail microcode on the KSs
doesn't seem to work any better than the powerfail code on the KL-Bs
(worse, actually, about once every six months XX or OZ will reboot
correctly after a powerfail and surprise the hell out of everybody).

I know that in the case of the KL-Bs running twenex microcode this has
been a problem for years.  It gets fixed, then broken, then fixed, ad
nauseum.  Unless Alan tells me otherwise I'd assume it's a similar
problem on the KSs.

Or is it, for some reason beyond my ken, considered a feature that ITS
needs a human to reboot?

The twenex world recently discovered that an RP0x which gets a header
compare error (HCE) without getting a header CRC error (HCRC) at the
same time may need to have a recalibrate operation done rather than
just a recenter and retry type thing. Otherwise the head ends up
mispositioned till it eventually slams into the stops (which either
fixes it or breaks it but good).

Apparently this is contrary to what the "manual" says.

I don't know what ITS does in this case. Just writing it down for
the record.

Message-ID: <143202.870122.ALAN@AI.AI.MIT.EDU>

After fixing PEEK to not needlessly PCLSR device servers a few days ago, I
have been periodically watching COMSAT and DQDEV on MC waiting to catch
them in the act of getting hung up.  This afternoon I found them in the
wedged state and was able to figure out what causes the problem.  The
problem has nothing to do with the BOJ/JOB code, and is not a bug in DQDEV.
Actually it is an apparently long-standing timing error in the
implementation of .HANG.  

Specifically, when you did (as DQDEV does)

	TRNN AC,%FLAG
	 .HANG

the code for .HANG knew that the TRNN instruction could never skip unless
the C(AC) changed, and since nothing can change a job's accumulators
without PCLSRing the job, .HANG could simply hang forever.  This is all
well and good, except .HANG neglected to run the instruction once itself to
be certain that AC hadn't been changed by an interrupt routine that ran
-between- the TRNN and the .HANG.

I have assembled an ITS with the fix and I will test it the next time I get
a chance.

After reading the following bug report, you will realize that this reveals
a bug in the way jobs are sometimes killed when they have locks locked.  If
you -first- clobbering their PC's to point to a .LOGOUT in location 0, and
only the .LOGOUT then checks to see if the PC is in the critical routine
table, then the critical routine table is worthless...

Re:   Mysterious MC won't shut down crash explained

You aren't going to like this one damn bit.

TMPLOC 44,	-LCCBLK,,CCBLK	;aobjn ptr to critical code table for lock hacking

looks like it would put an aobjn pointer into location 44, doesn't it?

It doesn't.  It puts -LCCBLK into location 44 and CCBLK into the next
location inline (where it happens to get ignored).  This is because

	; TMPLOC <loc>,<parenthesized arg> - puts argument at given LOC
	;	without changing location counter outside macro call.
DEFINE TMPLOC VAL,?ARG
[definition deleted]

Why the heck doesn't TMPLOC use a rest-of-line arg?

Now -LCCBLK is -1,,777772, an aobjn pointer to a page that is mapped
into absolute page 120, which contains whatever it happens to contain.
If the PC happens to lie within the bounds of the first word there,
the system executes the second word there as an instruction, with the
extra added feature (see IODCD1 in ITS) that if the LH is zero, SETOM
is substituted.  Thus when Comsat executes the .LOGOUT that ALOGO4
puts into its AC 0 when the system job guns it, the unlocking of
Comsat's locked switches, if that absolute page contains zeros,
will do a SETOM 0.  If Comsat doesn't pclsr, that -1 is never seen,
but if it does PCLSR out of the .LOGOUT (we still don't know where
it pclsred from), it executes that -1 as an instruction, causing the
lossage we saw.  Yow!

It looks like it's been this way for eons.  Maybe this also explains
why the Comsat locks don't always seem to work right.

    I just spent five minutes looking at the DISK code.  Based on that
    wealth of experience, it appears to me that if I were to bring up the KS
    with UNSAFE+1 JFCL'd out, it would stop doing a BUGPAUSE every hour or
    so.

    Somebody tell me why I shouldn't do this, before I wear out the $P keys
    on the KS's console....

The idea was that if the disk goes unsafe, is reset, and goes unsafe
again within one second, it is probably about to explode and the fire
department should be called.  It looks like the code jumps to UNSAFE
for a lot of different reasons, not all of which are the drive going
unsafe.  The drive also goes unsafe for a lot of different reasons,
some of more consequence than others.

I agree that if you JFCL out the BUGPAUSE it won't do it any more, so if
you think this won't do irreparable harm to the disk, go ahead.

I just spent five minutes looking at the DISK code.  Based on that
wealth of experience, it appears to me that if I were to bring up the KS
with UNSAFE+1 JFCL'd out, it would stop doing a BUGPAUSE every hour or
so.

Somebody tell me why I shouldn't do this, before I wear out the $P keys

    AI hung in a fashion I'd never seen on the KS's: disk accesses would
    hang forever.  Pages in core were easily accessible; ITS ran fine
    unless you tried to touch the disk.  I could create a job and run some
    instructions in low memory, but when I tried to do a .CALL OPEN ITS
    hung.

You must have been lucky.  Our RP06's have been causing ITS to hang in this
way ever since day 1.

    I went upstairs and the system console said:
    DSK: UNIT #1 CAME BACK ONLINE 
    DSK: UNIT #0 CAME BACK ONLINE
    DSK: UNIT #1 CAME BACK ONLINE
    and some status registers.  For all three, ER1= 40000 which is Drive
    Unsafe. 

Unsafe almost always comes on.  The interesting bits were the ones in ER3,
which according to the crash dump were (according to the crufty
documentation) "AC power low", "DC power low" and "Spare" (!).

    I dumped it to CRASH DSKOFL, not that I think it will help any.

Why?  I manadged to get the ER3 bits out of it.

    Notice that the crash file was written out but the dates were not set
    on the file?

DSKDMP never sets write dates, because it doesn't know how to tell the
time.  The DMPCPY program (which TARAKA runs when the system boots) sets
the date on any file it suspects is a crash dump.  In this case, DMPCPY
wasn't able to set the date either, because you had cold booted the
machine, so ITS didn't know what time it was when DMPCPY ran.

    ...  By the way, should these be going to BUG-ITS or KS-ITS -- I can
    never tell any more.

You sent this to the right place.  KS-ITS is almost -never- the right place
to send a Bug Report.

For most of yesterday (Thursday the 18th) COMSAT on MC was catatonic.  Our
guess is that it was stuck in a JOB device wait (waiting for the DQ
device).  As soon as Alan looked at the situation COMSAT started running
again, so probably something he did caused COMSAT to get PCLSR'd out of the
system call for the first time all day, and the second time the timing
screw did not occur.

The right thing is for someone to fix the last bug in the JOB/BOJ code.

A quick fix the COMSAT maintainers might consider, is to take an occasional
%PIRLT interrupt to keep its interactions with DQ lubricated.

A better fix would be for Alan to finish up the improved Domain Demon
interface, so that COMSAT can use it instead, and not be subject to this
particular class of ITS bug.

    ... maybe lester didn't fix the disk hard enough.

I don't think it is related.  This is a problem we have had ever since we
went to two drives.  The symptom is that for no apparent reason a drive
interrupts you and reports that it has just recently come back online.
Both drives do it.  We have no idea why they do this.  We also have no idea
why the code that we put in to recover from this doesn't work.  (Perhaps we
need to reset the drive harder when this happens.)  Luckily this doesn't
seem to happen all that often, but it has been the most common reason for
AI crashes since we got the new drive.

It also seems that if one drive is in the middle of a transfer, and you
tell the other drive to do something, the first drive will interrupt you
and complain that you shouldn't bother it while it is busy.  We simply
ignore these complaints, which seems to work just fine.  (Like it's
happened 470 times since AI came up 10 hours ago...)

    Howdy, I would like to make a copy of the great ITS operating system,

    possable, although probably not likely.
    In any case, I wonder if someone would be willing at some point to
    show, or instruct me, or guide me in some way in how to make the two
    tapes I would need to a) Boot ITS and build a system, and b) Load in
    the sources to ITS, and any applications that are deemed ok to
    take/have.
    Please forgive me if this is the wrong forum, but I have been trying to
    find help from various points and ran out of places to ask... Thanks
    for any help.

    Btw, it may be simpler for anyone who wishes to reply to me, to just
    send me mail on MC, since I don't know if ITS can deal with uucp path
    names, although it may. Thanks again.

of course ITS can deal with uucp paths, at least up to a point. however, as
you suspect, USER-A is the wrong place to ask. even you could have thought
of asking BUG-ITS.

I assembled and installed a new version of IOELEV for the KL.  The
only change is that it now knows that its name has changed (no longer
tells you you are connected to MC).  I'll change the namespace
sometime soon if there aren't any problems with this.

While I was installing this silliness, I reorganized the IOELEV
binaries.  KL Console-11 binaries are (as before) in IOELEV nnnBIN
with IOELEV BIN as a link to the latest version (now IOELEV 431BIN).
The AI-Chaos-11 binaries are now in IOELEV nnnAI with a link from
IOELEV AIBIN to the latest version (IOELEV 430AI, the one where I made
subnet six the "primary" address of AI-11 so dover spooling would work
better).

I don't expect any problems.  Next person who cold boots the KL please
tell me what happens (if no problems, tell me that).

    during IAP this year.  We have done this twice before with somewhat mixed
    results.  A few sessions were quite memorable, and a few were dogs.  Before

    Volunteers who would enjoy teaching about something.

    Ways of using this to burn excess machine cycles on our many (!) ITS
    machines.  (Student project ideas?)

I don't think I have any of my notes from IAP'83.  Do you (Alan) have
any from IAP'84?  I seemed to remember talking about some of the
following:
	UUOs/.CALL, their skip-on-success feature, their argument
	  passing/returning syntax
	TTY management
	Devices, MLDEV:, CLU/I/O/A:, etc
	Jobs (and BOJs)
	File system, links, etc.
	Greenblat's History lecture
	Moon's hardware description of (the original) AI
With the general proliferation of PCs and high level languages, some of
the more gutsy things, which are the interesting things, may require a
(refresher) course on the assembly language concepts.

Emacs on AI has been dying on me repeatedly over the last few days.
It always chokes in the same place, with a message like:

.VAL 0; 6767>>MOVEM 6,1377  6/   177  1377/   176

A quick peek reveals that this immediately follows a .call corblk,
which I guess is failing.

Proceeding the job makes it work until the next try.

My first guess is hardware flaking, possibly followed by inadequate resetting
action by the software. The code hasn't changed in forever.

        MT:RETRYING WRITE OPERATION
        MAG TAPE STATUS TM03 error status decode routine needs to be written ?
        MTAPE: FORMATTER ERROR, STATUS= 140600,,40000

This is transport unsafe, usually means it went offline while trying to
write.

        MTAPE: FORMATTER ERROR, STATUS=150660,,100320
        MAG TAPE STATUS TM03 error status decode routine needs to be written ?

This is a mess. To some extent the bits are inconsistant (seems to imply a
number of data transfer errors during a positioning command), but could
possibly be interpreted as the result of a misformed data transfer command.

    I assume multi-reel incremental dumps have worked in the past...

Is this actually true?

    when i tried to dump AI (incr) this evening, i lost. AI 230 ran off the

    MT:RETRYING WRITE OPERATION
    MAG TAPE STATUS TM03 error status decode routine needs to be written ?
    MTAPE: FORMATTER ERROR, STATUS= 140600,,40000

    and giving me a DUMP prompt.  thinking this might just be a case of
    terminal dirk, i cleaned the drive and started over again with the
    same tape. same result. so i tried dumping onto AI 231. this time, i
    got

    MTAPE: FORMATTER ERROR, STATUS=150660,,100320
    MAG TAPE STATUS TM03 error status decode routine needs to be written ?

    the job at a prompt, and the tape waiting at EOT. so i rewound it and
    ICHECK'd it. the ICHECK ended without any strange msgs. 

    maybe the first time was just due to incorrectly placed-EOT mark (it
    did have one, but i'm not sure which side they're -supposed- to be on),
    but the second tape worked OK. so something is wrong here..

The MT: and MTAPE: messages (why the inconsistency?) show up in :PEEK ",
so they came from the ITS system rather than from DUMP (it can be hard
to distinguish when you run DUMP on the system-console).  The
"error status decode routine needs to be written" message came from DUMP.
I guess its routine for explaining the details of tape errors was never
converted from the version for the KA/KL tape controller.

John, do you know what those octal numbers in the formatter error message
mean?  I assume multi-reel incremental dumps have worked in the past, so
has something in the hardware broken?  The tape code in ITS hasn't changed
recently, has it?

There must be a path through the ITS TCP code that fails to free a buffer
somehow.  Twice I have seen MC run itself completely out of buffers.  (See
the dump MC:CRASH;CRASH TCPFUL, for an example.)  In the most recent
example, ITS had been running for 35 days before this happened, which might
be relevant, although in the previous case it had only been running for 10
days.

Bug-COMSAT:  COMSAT behaves weirdly when this happens.  Take a look at some
of the recent stats files on MC.  Like for -every- host it tries to contact
with TCP it reports: Bad Greeting="+" or somesuch.

Making it a new system call is fine.  What I'm looking for is a single
UUO that will return the information currently returned by .RLPDTM
plus time zone information.  Doesn't have to be in .RLPDTM format, but
should be easy to calculate things like DATIME"TIMGTN from it.

For that matter it would be a win if there was a system call that did
the DATIME"TIMGTN calculation with maximum hair and all the leap year
corrections understood to the human race, once, at system boot time,
then just added system uptime to that to get current time.  This
business of having to recalculate the number of leap years since 1 Jan
1900 every time you want an absolute time value is for the birds.

Why don't we just add another system call to return timezone related
information rather than trying to squeeze something into the last few bits
of .RYEAR?  First, I dislike recycling fields that are documented to be
zero (rather than being documented as reserved for future expansion.)
Second, given the existence of half-hour and even quarter-hour timezones in
parts of the world, five bits isn't really enough.  Third, while we are at
it, it might be a good idea to try and do something about generalizing the
daylight savings time stuff to cover whatever local laws there might be
geverning time.

Sorry, I should have made that a formal propoal, bits and all.

Time zones range from +1200 to -1200 (international date line, one day
apart from each other).

The two possible formats would be:

	the five low bits of an integer in the range -12. -> +12.

or
	one sign bit (3.5) and four bits of integer range 0 -> +12.

Only difference is in how you insert/extract it, of course.

It would be nice if programs didn't have to have hardwired knowledge
of what time zone they are in (yes, I know, all ITS machines are at MIT
and thus in time zone -0500, but we're trying to be evangelical, here,
right?).

Bits 3.5 -> 3.1 of the result from .RYEAR are defined as zero.
24. (maxium time zone plus one) is 30 in octal.  Seems a timezone
would fit into those bits very nicely.

Anybody know of anything that would break if this were done?
About the only thing I can think of that this would mess up
would be grossitudes like MOVEI AC,@MEM (ignoring the fact that
HRRZ AC,MEM works just as well).  Does anybody really care
what's in those five zeroed bits?

(No, nothing of vital importance depends on this, it would just make
some code I was writing a little cleaner.)

Closer examination of my problem controlling my telnet connection to MX
reveals that my logout file on AI is sending telnet IAC DONT TRBIN even
though the MX->AI connection is supdup and not telnet.  The problem is
that the only way I can test for a telnet connection is to look at %TPMTA
because the IAC DO TRBIN in the login file turns off the %TPTEL bit!

I guess the way to tell if you are telnetting or supduping is to first
look at %TPCBS, if it's on you're supdup, if it's off look at %TPMTA
and if it's on you're telnet, otherwise it's unknown but for my purposes
this case doesn't matter.  Maybe the tctyp program should handle this?

note that BUG^K prompts "to:" but should prompt "to: bug-"

When I log in my init file checks for a telnet connection and
does :imgout 377 375 0 which sends a telnet IAC DO TRBIN so
that the TAC will pass @ characters instead of intercepting them,
and pass the 8th bit so the meta key works from my ann arbor.

it looks like nethopping bereaks this somehow, because after
nethopping to either AI or OZ the TAC stops passing meta bits
and starts to intercept @ characters.

lester found another instance of the right drive belt somewhere, and even
installed it, so MX's tape drive works again. thanks, lester.

this means we can again read and write 800bpi 7track tapes. however, we
shouldn't WRITE any, because we can't read them anywhere else. i have run
an incremental dump of MX over the net, using Gut's drive (1600 bpi
9track). this causes a few non-fatal errors on the MX end but apparently
works (see system log). any future dumps of MX should be done this way;
i'll do them, or other interested parties (ty?) can ask how. it's only a
little more complicated than dumping to the local drive.

all old incremental tapes for MX are hereby retired and should only be used
to read off of. i have started a new set of incremental tapes at 375 (so
will not overwrite older tape data). all 1600bpi LCS ITS tapes are now on
the rack by the dover. i will try to run a full dump soon. we should get on
with the project of copying the GFR tapes, and then (if possible) proceed
forward into the past, copying full dumps as we go.

This afternoon AI crashed because the TCP segment checksuming routine

may have trashed the accumulators and the BUGxxx locations before taking
the dump.  I guess we have to suspect that this routine checksums
randomness a lot, and we were only lucky to catch it this time because it

It's getting pretty hard to get a ROLM phone connection to AI
these days.

Would it be possible to fix it so that AI hangs up the
ROLM phone after someone logs out (i.e. when it says
"Console Free", it should disconnect the Rolm phone).

This is the same disk hung lossage we have been experiencing ever since we

code that Moon wrote didn't actually address the correct problem, although
I do notice that in this crash dump NQOFFL has been AOSed once for each

    I've been getting old copies of info-space mailing list mailings (from

    roughly since the crash when the mail queue was damaged.  When is the
    redundancy likely to end?  Is there anything to be done to cut off the
    useless mail?
this has nothing to do with OZ's mail queue, but is instead the result of
the retransmission of mail lost on (the old) MC this spring, as announced
in a msg to arpanet-bboards a few weeks ago (a copy is available if you
missed it).  you are fortunate to be on a mailing list which did not
absolutely depend on MC as a transmission step and which chose to
retransmit immediately, by other paths, those msgs which did not go through
the first time. most recipients of this mail are seeing it for the first
time; we regret that you are encoutering redundancy. the retransmission
process should be completed in about another week.

Message-Id:  <860609182112.975425@MIT-MULTICS.ARPA>

What I suggested was this:  On ITS, there is the database maintained
using :INQUIR.  This database is not only consulted by :FINGER on ITS
and the FINGER protocol on the Internet and CHAOS, but was in the past
maintained consistently across 4 ITS sites.

This makes it a good example of a distributed database to be used as a
phone directory.  MIT Information Systems now encompasses MIT
telecommunications which produces the MIT directory.  Jan's group is now
writing a proposal and proposed specification for a system that might
eventually enable us to put the MIT Staff and Student directories on
line and allow people to update their own entries, and perhaps route
electronic mail as well.

Perhaps the original implementors of :INQUIR are known to people on this
list, or even former SIPB members.  Did anyone ever publish a paper on
this work, such as an undergraduate thesis?  Is the only documentation
of the goals and operation of this system in the source code?  What is
the source code written in and how could it be found?

Please direct replies to Popiel@MIT-Multics.ARPA.  I will assist him in
retrieving files and interpreting jargon.
                                        -- Spencer

----------------------------------------------------

What I (CBF) sent was this:


Well, you're right, in the past it was maintained consistently across 4
ITS sites;  now its maintained across 5 (AI, ML, MC, MD, & MX).  Anyway,
the mechanisms are fairly simple and CPU intensive.  Basically it is done
by mailing the updated record to all the other machines.  The mailer on
each machine spawn subtasks that merge the record into the database by
copying the entire database to one with a new name, and then using the ITS
rename while open call to atomically instantiate the new one and delete
the old one.

There is no attempt made to ensure that I don't change my record in rapid
succession on two different ITS's.  If I were to do that, it is
conceivable that entries on the different machines could be inconsistent.
In practice it just doesn't happen, or if it did, its trivial for
someone to fix it.  Note also that having the mailer daemon do the
database update (even on the same machine) simplifies a host of issues,
since the mailer is a single execution thread on ITS there is no need to
worry about concurrent updates.

If two man months have been put into this effort over the more than 10
years it has been in service, I would be shocked.

Unfortunately, I remember how the C compiler works. So at some point I'll
probably get around to making a couple of other changes to the spooler
(like, we don't really need it to distribute TeX font files anymore)
and compiling a new one.

In the meantime half of creation has changed their DOVER programs to
spool to MX. So we need to leave the spooler on the KL running for a
while.

John, I'm just guessing it was you that moved the dover spooler from the KL
to the KS?  It didn't seem to be working.  I theorized that this had to do
with the fact that it had the device PK1: built into the source in many
places, so I launched another spooler with a translation from PK1: to DSK:
which now seems to be working.  I fixed the sources to use PK0: instead of
PK1:, which should work on any ITS machine for the forseeable future.  I
couldn't assemble the sources because (assuming I know how to run the C
compiler, which I don't) there are all kinds of C libraries that have been
migrated to KL GFR tapes.

Anyone who cares about dover spooling is free to finish what John and I
have started I guess.  Step one is to get back the C libraries I guess...
I've always been in favor of kicking the dover out the window, so I'm
certainly in no rush to do this myself.

While I was at it, I fixed the various job devices so that DVR^F would know
to contact the KS now, instead of the KL.

I did -not- install a MC:CHANNA;RAKASH DVRSPL on the KS, because any newly
launched demon still needs that translation to function.  Until someone
assembles (and links, how unaesthetic for an ITS!) the new sources, the
demon can be launched by hand by running the xfile .DOVR.;.SPOOL XFILE1 on
the KS.  (Hackers who might bring the MC KS up, take note!)

If you assemble the current source it won't run unless you use the

OVHCLK/ POPJ P, which will keep it from executing the instructions
that aren't implemented.  OIPBIT is non-zero now, but it should still

	Can't we fold this into INFO-ITS?
    INFO-ITS is an extremely low-volume mailing list.  It is for spreading
    information that ordinary ITS users and programmers might want to know.
    Like when a new device is installed (like LP7:), or a new Midas library
    is written, or a new machine is installed, or a new system call is
    installed or improved.
    KS-ITS is for people who are interested in the project of getting 2020s
    installed at MIT running ITS.  When I got the KS10 microcode to do
    ITS-style paging, I sent mail to KS-ITS.  The people on INFO-ITS I
    didn't bother until they could log in.
    A lot of mail that has gone to KS-ITS in the last few months should
    have been sent to BUG-ITS.  Like if AI crashes in some novel way,
    people send mail to KS-ITS "because AI is a KS", even though BUG-ITS is
    the proper recipient.
    The people on KS-ITS were interested in keeping in touch with a "good
    hack", which is distinct from both BUG-ITS and INFO-ITS.

gumby, the next time you ask 4 people's opinion about making the sort of
major change you suggested, why not wait until more than 1 replies before
deciding what to do? i have just spent 2 hours undoing the confusion you
created by going ahead with this merger after only one response. among
other things, you completely omitted the BUG-ITS archive.  fortunately i
discovered a BUG-ITS list member who hasn't logged in for the past few
days, and so was able to recover the lost msgs. i have also unmerged the
INFO-ITS and KS-ITS archives. also, it's considered courteous, when you
insist on rashly forging ahead in this fashion, to inform -all- the list
members involved; you only told those people on KS-ITS who were not on
INFO-ITS:

i agree with alan -- the INFO-, BUG-, and KS-ITS have distinct purposes and
should be kept that way. now that the KSs run ITS, a lot of the discussion
previously carried on on KS-ITS should move to BUG-ITS or other more

Heck, you should have looked yesterday!  AI was running NITS, MC was
running XITS, MD was running ITS...  The various names have no relation to
eachother.

    When MD came up, it deleted .temp.; because it was empty.  Does anything
    depend on that dir existing?   Just in case,  i recreated it.

Many things want there to be a .TEMP. directory.  However .TEMP. is on a
(very) short list of directories that are automatically created whenever
anyone tries to use them, so you needn't have gone to the trouble.  In

depend on that dir existing?   Just in case,  i recreated it.

    I think the funny messages from the IMP have to do with some

The RFC that describes 1822L tells all, claiming that the IMP will
send the usual 3-NOP-and-a-reset sequence twice, once in 1822 format
and once in 1822L format, interleaving the messages. You are supposed
to tell it what you want by answering in your choice of format. If you
do this before it has sent the full sequence it will stop sending in
the protocol you don't want.

Which is all well and good, except that this RFC is dated in 1983.  So
it only took them three years to implement...?

sort of like its first date, or something -- it's just not the same

anyway, the GFR did run over AI SECOND:, taking 5K blocks off to tape.  Due
to cruftiness not yet worked around in the code (something to do with EOT),
we can't yet run incremental GFRs -- successive small GFRs onto the same
tape.  so i had to go for maximum usage of single tape instead. given the
amount of tape left, i think i could have gone for 6K blocks and won; that
we'll try next time.

the tape is in the rack with the other ITS tapes. as usual, this is a
Sacred GFR Tape -- be careful with it.

All and Sundry are reminded that all 4 KSs (when they're running ITS) are
regularly backed up -- help relieve AI's load by moving your files

All ITS machines with IMPs do this when you boot them now.  I presume the
software in the IMP has changed incompatibly somehow.  We all have to learn
to ignore this until somebody gets around to fixing it.

    'Nother funny thing: LAST time it was booted, it complained that it
    couldn't set the time, because 15 out of the 13 times it got from the
    net did not agree.  Besides sounding damn funny, it seems that
    requiring 15 good times is a little stringent.

Well, its just phrased a little funny.  It -asked- 25 people, and it
insists on getting 15 answers that agree back.  If only 13 people respond,
then indeed 15 of the 13 answers failed to agree!

I don't want to insist on a majority of the -responders-, since then if
only 1 machine responds that happens to be mistaken, the mistake spreads.
Look at it this way, this demon is just a convenience to save you from
having to run PDSET 95% of the time, you have to expect to do it manually
every now and then.

At 6 this morning, MX started complaining often about being out of
jobslots on the console.  About 10, I couldn't supdup in, so I came
up.  I couldn't log into the console either -- it ignored ^Z.  So I
hit boot, and it said BT SW and ?BT 001200 and wouldn't listen to me.
So I got the fep and started at 777700 and that didn't work either, so
I booted again and it worked that time.  

My guess is that comsat is unhappy about its imp connection and dying
without freeing up its slot.

    ML was getting a gross and astonishing number of ECC errors this morning.

We are talking -memory- EEC corrected errors rather than -disk- ECC
corrected errors I believe.

    see console output around 3-4 am. what does this? what can we do about it?

It means that there are some bad bits in ML's memory.  Its funny, AI has
never had a single one of these errors, but all -three- of the new KS10's
have memory boards in them that get ECC errors.

    i was dumping it and shoving some files on during this time -- maybe this
    has something to do with the flaky chaosnet?

Unlikely to be related other than the fact that you were just exercising
the machine in general.  The real problem here is that when I wrote the
code for logging the ECC errors, I didn't fully understand what it would be
like when they started happening regularly.  (My code also has a bug that
causes MD to essentially loop in the scheduler because of a bad bit in a
particularly sensitive location.)  I plan to re-write this code to be less
noisy and more robust soon.

see console output around 3-4 am. what does this? what can we do about it?
i was dumping it and shoving some files on during this time -- maybe this
has something to do with the flaky chaosnet?

    Subject: MC <--> KS/MX mail switching
    To: CENT@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU
    After reading MC MAIL would it be a 'good thing' if I sent address
    update messages to those list maintainers saying that MBECK@MC should
    now be MBECK@KL ?

no. KL is a local-only nickname; on the general arpanet it's an alias for
SRI-KL, and sending your mail there would not help anyone. when the KS
(currently MX) and the KL (currently MC) switch names, they will retain
their model aliases -- the KL will be called MX or (locally) KL, while the
KS will be called MC or KS. this feature was arranged so we could do a
number of local transforms. for instance, the KS will have somewhat
restricted use, so it can concentrate on mail; thus, among other things, we
don't want all those people who get mail on the present MC to have that
mail land on the KS after the name switch. for this reason, someone has run
a program over the inquir database to change all net-addresses of MC to KL;
this will ensure that their mail will end up on the same physical machine
as it does now. all ITS machines share a common inquir database and forward
mail in accordance with the net-addresses people give therein, so all your
mail will end up where you currently get it now. since your mail goes to
OZ, it will continue to make one hop from MC (whichever hardware) to the
twenex; if you received it on MC-KL, you would find it would begin taking
an extra hop to reach your mailbox, because the KL will (probably) go off
the arpanet when the names are switched and all mail bound for it will have
to be forwarded through MC-KS or AI.

Because I was updating so many programs to know about the new plethora of
ITS machines, I added exactly this feature.  There is a new table you can
ask for from the .GETSYS uuo: ITSNMS is a table of the sixbit names of the
-current- local ITS machines.  I have already converted most of the
programs that used to have built-in tables of ITS machines (INSTAL, FINGER,
FIND, etc.) to use this.  Do

    around 22:15 or so, AI stopped listening.... dumped it to CRASH;ITS
    HUNG, then reloaded. 

Looks like the same disk lossage again.  This time ITS had actually run out
of disk clannels.  Perhaps there is something wrong with one of the drives.
I'll try to figure this out after I get finished with this paper.  (I don't
grok the disk code well enough to do this immediately.)  I hope AI
continues to work for that long...  I renamed the crash to be
AI:CRASH;CRASH QLOSS"

BTW, penny, I figured out why MX's system console wouldn't talk to you.
The 8080 front end sometimes gets confused about the state of the system
console and stops forwarding characters through to the 10 (running out of
paper sometimes causes this to happen).  If you simply power-cycle the
LA120 this resets the 8080's opinion of things and you can use the system
console for input again.

Two recent crashes (in MC:CRASH;CRASH DRGFKT and AI:CRASH;CRASH BJUIS)
suggest that there is some problem with job device locking strategy.  I
guess we should have expected that having COMSAT using a job device 24
hours a day would expose some bugs.  The crash on MC is completely crazed
in the number of jobs that are confused.

AI just crashed again with the same lossage I complained about a couple
weeks ago.  The one where the system hangs up just like it does on MC when
the T-300 controller gets fucked.  (See AI:CRASH;CRASH QLOSS and
AI:CRASH;CRASH QLOSS'.)

There are now -five- machines running ITS at MIT, more than have ever
existed simultaneously before.  There is the MC KL10, and four KS10's named
AI, MX, ML, and MD.  

The MC KL10 is off maintenance contract as of the first of this month, so I
suppose its days are numbered.  At some point before the KL10 passes on to
that great machine room in the sky, the MC KL10 and the MX KS10 will swap
their names, and we will plug the new MC KS10 into the old MC's Arpanet
port.  This assures that as far as the outside world is concerned, there
will always be an ITS named MC at that Arpanet address, performing mail
service functions for MIT.  (Let's not get into the hair we will be going
through to make all the mailing lists in the world continue to work.)

The KL10 will remain available for all those who wish to continue to use
it, under the name MX.  When the KL10 retires, the name MX will be retired
with it.

Various other owners of KS10's around the world will be receiving KS10 ITS
distribution tapes in the mail soon.  The last machine we booted (MD) was
built by a volunteer using the printed instructions we plan to include with
our ITS distribution kits.

	(Note that until recently ROLM lines incorrectly had the %TYDIL bit
	set in their TTYTYP words, perhaps you are noticing an effect of
	this change.)
    I thought %TYDIL was correct for the ROLM lines, since they are exactly
    analogous to dialups; one connects terminals of different types to them, so
    they should have their tty types reset to something neutral when
    disconnected, etc.  And, if we supported it in the 11, they should hang up
    after they've been logged out for a while, all those dialup-y things.

I should have been more careful about how I used the word "incorrectly".
As you set things up originally the ROLM lines were just like dialups and
had %TYDIL set for all of the reasons you give.  This all worked just fine
and there wasn't a thing wrong with it.  Then I got my greasy fingers into
the act.  

I added a %TYRLM bit for the benefit of people and programs that wanted the
distinguish between ordinary dialups that you tended to connect to from
outside NE43 (like from home), and ROLM lines that you tended to connect to
from inside NE43 (like from your office).  In this state of affairs ITS
tested %TYDIL to determine if it should do all those dialup-y things, and
programs that wanted to know if you were at home could test to see if
%TYDIL was set and %TYRLM wasn't.

The problem is that there were a zillion programs (most of them written in
DDT command language) that just tested %TYDIL to see if the user was at
home.  Rather than fix all of them, I changed the meaning of %TYDIL to mean
what those programs already thought.  That way I only had to fix ITS to
test for %TYDIL+%TYRLM in those places where it was already testing just
for %TYDIL.

Now it is true that this broke programs that thought that %TYDIL meant
"connected through a line that needs to have its terminal type set", but
since somebody had to lose this argument I decided that these programs were
simply mistaken about the meaning of that bit.

Message-ID: <[AI.AI.MIT.EDU].28319.860418.ALAN>

The DEVICE directory was getting full due to the proliferation of various
ITS names (past, present, and future), 20X names (for RMTDEV), and various
concatenations of DIR with other device names.  So I increased, yet again,
the knowledge inside the unknown device handler (SYS;ATSIGN DEVICE) itself.

The unknown device handler now loads various foreign filesystem devices
from DEVICE;ATSIGN MLDEV or DEVICE;ATSIGN RMTDEV as appropriate.  Various
DIR devices that deal with the local filesystem are loaded directly from
DEVICE;ATSIGN DIRDEV.  Foreign filesystem DIR devices are loaded from
DEVICE;ATSIGN MLDEV.  (Archive DIR devices are not treated specially.)

Note that the unknown device handler always checks the DEVICE directory for
a JOBDEV file -before- looking at this new built-in knowledge, so it is
easy to do local customizations on each machine.  (Like on AI, the DIRAI
device is loaded from ATSIGN DIRDEV, whereas the default is to load it from
ATSIGN MLDEV.)

Oh yeah.  One of the reasons I was forced to do this is I added two
synonyms for MC and MX.  MC is now known also as "KL" and MX is now also
known as "KS".  The devices KL: and KS: work everywhere as appropriate.
When we swap the names "MC" and "MX" (that is, when MC becomes a KS10, and
MX becomes a KL10), we -won't- swap the names "KL" and "KS".  Thus the file
KL:ALAN;FOO BAR is the same file today as it will be next year, while
MC:ALAN;FOO BAR will be a different one.

(This did have the odd side effect that the NETWRK library now returns
"MIT-KL" as the SIXBIT name for MC...)

	What's the difference between running a job in the background and
	disowning it?

    beyond my limited technical ability to describe. someone on this list should
    be able to help you more.

Roughly speaking, a disowned job has no superior nor controlling TTY,
(f'rinstance like COMSAT normally runs).  DDT lets you run jobs in
background, (e.g.  w/ or ) by running them without the TTY and
handling output differently.  Their superior is still DDT.  From ITS's
point of view the only difference between running a job in foreground or
in background is who owns the TTY.

For a more detailed description, do :UUO .DISOWN, .ATTY, etc.

PS: bug-its people: what do you think of using BUG-ITS for questions
    like this?  I think it's a good idea, but if it's going to cause the
    fixers of bugs to remove themselves on the grounds of traffic
    levels, then we should have yet another list.

AI:CRASH;CRASH QLOSS contains a crash dump that I can't figure out.  I
don't, unfortunately, grok the interface between the main program level
disk code and the interrupt level.  It looked for all the world (to the
users) like what happens on MC when the system is hung trying to write
directories to the T-300's.  I can tell that the main program level code is
waiting for bits to arrive from interrupt level, but I don't understand why
interrupt level isn't coming through.

Of course, the fact that we have two disk drives for the first time on a KS
is something to be suspicious of...

    Well I just noticed that right now all new files on AI are being placed
    on the secondary pack!

This turned out to be easy to fix.  If the pack on unit #0 had enough free
space, ITS never noticed that it was not a primary pack.  I fixed ITS to
find a primary pack the first time someone writes a file after a boot.

When I booted AI Friday morning, I wanted to test that I had built a
working front-end filesystem and DSKDMP on the secondary pack.  Since both
the 8080 front end and DSKDMP assume they should boot from unit #0, I
switched the unit number plugs so that the secondary pack was on unit #0
and the primary pack was on unit #1.

Well I just noticed that right now all new files on AI are being placed on
the secondary pack!  Yesterday, with the units arranged the other way files
were being made on PK0: just like the should have.  Perhaps this is some
unforseen result of my decision to number the secondary pack #1?  (I should
have chosen #13 to be conventional, but couldn't think of any reason why I
couldn't choose any number I wanted.)  Barf.

Apparently the controller told ITS that drive #1, which I believe is
powered off, was asking for attention.  (Perhaps it was wondering when DEC
was coming back with the part they need to fix it.)  When ITS obligingly
asked the controller to ask the drive what its status was, the controller
reported that it timed out on the drive.  I guess we write this one off to
hardware flakeiness.

MIT-MX came up for the first time this morning.  (You can supdup there
right now, but you won't find much when you get there...)  There are still
some problems with the technology for creating new ITS systems from
scratch, but it mostly works.  Hopefully after doing the next two (ML and
MD) things will be pretty smooth.

All kind of worms are crawling out of the woodwork because of various
programs that -know- that all ITS machines are named "AI", "MC", "ML", or
"DM".  It should take another days hacking to stomp them all...

Pinhead!  You modified MC:SYSNET;TELSER instead of AI:SYSNET;TELSER.
If people make pinheaded mistakes like this we will be up to our
necks in forked sources.

Everybody:  Remember that sources live on AI!  If you are in doubt,
look for a file named " MOVED TO AI " on the directory containing
the source in question on MC.  If this file exists, then all of
the sources on that directory now live on AI.  This has
been true of all SYS*** directories for a couple of days now.

OK this is it.  The migration of ITS system files from MC to AI is

question about the status of a particular directory, look for a file on
that directory named " MOVED TO AI ".  If that file exists, then the file
you are looking for now lives on AI, edits on MC are likely to be lost.  If
that file doesn't exist, then MC still has the master copy.  In any case,
if I am logged in, be cautious about timing screws.

Well, basically I don't seem to ever be able to get the space to end of
tape operation to work for me.  Symptom:  Mount a scratch tape and copy
some files onto it (using :COPY for example).  Rewind the tape (using the
REWIND command in DUMP).  Open MT0: in .BIO mode and issue a 
.MTAPE [ch,,[10]], while watching the drive.  Observe that it clearly
doesn't go to the end of the tape.  Do the same UUO again without closing
the channel and get an IRRECOVERABLE DATA ERROR.

We are certainly going to need space-to-end-of-tape to work before we can
start doing GFRs on a regular basis, since I understand GFR tapes are
just appended together.

Another oddity:  Suppose you wrote three files on the tape.  Rewind the
tape and try reading them (using :PRINT).  Observe that it looks like there
is an extra, fourth, empty file after the files you wrote (before you start
getting DEVICE FULL, which I presume is what you expect to get at the end
of the tape).

A fellow just tried to read a 7-track tape (from ML) on AI's tape drive.
The results were pretty interesting.  He certainly didn't get any bits back
and he caused DUMP and the magtape code to get pretty upset.  The real fun
started when he tried to kill the DUMP job.  His DDT got hung up in .UCLOSE
at MTICL+12 waiting for outstanding tape commands to go away.

I took a crash dump in AI:CRASH;MTAPE CLOSE.  Note that some interesting
error messages from the tape driver were printed on the system console
before this happened.

I'll bet lots of pinheads try this in the future.  Perhaps we sould license
people before they can run DUMP?

Unfortunately, all of a sudden Penny seems unable to get through an

the Chaos net board glitch the other day which only happened once.)  Maybe
the LH/DH really -does- have something to do with this?  Or perhaps someone

    Does anyone know how long the NXM timeout on a KS10 unibus is?  The
    Chaos board can be slower to respond (3 or 4 microseconds?) when you
    read it twice in a row, as I recall.

I think I remember it being 20 us.

    Are the KS10 cabinet and the LH/DH cabinet firmly grounded to each
    other?  If not, connecting a Unibus cable between them might cause
    electrical problems.

That's a thought; they're not.

I'm inclined to write this off to cosmic rays, and worry about it if it
ever happens again after the hardware configuration of that unibus
settles down.

I hope we don't have to resort to them.  It would be in the grand tradition
of the previous two MIT-AI machines, though.

							  If there were system
    messages from the magtape code indicating that it was unhappy as well, then
    perhaps we can conclude that the fault happened somewhere in the "I" Unibus
    itself.  (It would be nice if :SYSMSG worked on a crash dump!)

I used to have a program to do this, I think.  Better would be to stick SYSMSG
inside PEEK and then take advantage of PEEK's existing crash-dump-analysis feature.

    Perhaps someone who knows more Unibusology than I do can offer an opinion
    about what might cause this?  Remember that this is the Unibus that
    supports the magtape drive, the DZ11's and the Chaosnet interface.  The
    magtape code was shooting bits back and forth like crazy at the time,
    presumably that contributed somehow?

    JTW:  Is the LH/DH plugged into this bus right now?  Perhaps it did
    something nasty?

JTW: Can you look at the crash dump and figure out whether the magtape RH-11
was supposed to be doing DMA at the time this crash happened?  Maybe it and
the Chaos board interfere with each other somehow?

Does anyone know how long the NXM timeout on a KS10 unibus is?  The Chaos
board can be slower to respond (3 or 4 microseconds?) when you read it twice
in a row, as I recall.

Are the KS10 cabinet and the LH/DH cabinet firmly grounded to each other?  If not,
connecting a Unibus cable between them might cause electrical problems.

Yes, and maybe so. Specially since it doesn't seem to work like it is

The second read from CAIRBF got a Non-Existent I/O Register error; just

        on the drive. apparently Ty was running a full dump. the dump log
        contains a note on the MC 4000 line: "Something happened". dave,
        didn't you say something about 4000 being the max. number for an

    I don't recall saying that.  There is a limit on the highest tape number
    that's controlled by the size of the SYSENG;MACRO TAPES file.  The limit
    can be changed; I don't remember how, but it involves code in DUMP that's
    commented something like "Don't do this unless you are RJL, and even then
    be careful."  We probably don't need to import RJL to do it.  If you need
    me to come over and figure out the details, ask.

This limit must have been reached in the past since the full dump tapes
recorded in the database only go back to some time in 1983.  

But just in case, I figured out the way to change the limit and upped it to
5000.  So we probably don't need to worry about this limit on MC ever
again...

    Due to the installation of a new mail system, I can no longer ship off
    TELECOM to MC. Since there are quite a large number of MC users on
    TELECOM, and considering the fact that this restriction might affect
    other digests, I am sending this message to your bulletin board rather
    than individually to MC users.

I -believe- what he is refering to is the fact that digests tend to be
large enough that they exceed COMSAT's pitifully small size limitation.

I note that CSTACY claimed the lock for hacking COMSAT two weeks ago,
hacked on it for an evening, and hasn't logged in since then.

There are now about 130 BADREQ files on .MAIL2, many of them 2 weeks old.
(I'm going to have to create .MAIL3 soon...)

Warning:  If the day ever comes that I feel that it is Up-To-Me-
To-Do-Something about COMSAT (because of address space problems, lack of
proper domain support, or whatever) I will simply advise everybody that ITS
no longer supports mail for users or mail forwarding for the network and I
will shut it off.

I feel this day -rapidly- approaching.  I don't see any competent
programmers making the kind of necessary effort it is going to take to
straighten out this mess.  I am forwarding this message to a large audience
in the hopes that somebody will get inspired, but I realize this is
grasping at straws.

	There are way too many (old) static routes in the table. They
don't seem to get updated correctly; data for SCRC was going through the
(loaded) MIT-GW instead of the (idle) MIT-AI-GW, although the rest
of the Internet got the change months ago. Someone should delete all
but the necessary ones. I deleted the SCRC one and patched it out in the
running system, with the result that it instantly picked up the right one.
	Also, the ICMP Redirect code is not the best possible in that
it does no handle per-Host Redirects well; it folds them all into
the single net entry. When we start attaching ITSen to subnetted nets,
this will lose big; traffic to different subnets will thrash the
cache line. For that matter, the ITS IP layer doesn't use the correct
'mask' algorithm for dealing with host addresses (per RFC940, etc).

    ITS took a page fault.  Look in CRASS PAGFLT if you care.

Specifically, ITS took a page fault running in the scheduler.  It thought
it was looking at somebody's USTP bits, but U contains gubbish, and it
looks like the hardware pagetable must have contained some kind of a joke
as well.  I am tempted to agree with you that this was the result of
glitch.  (That must be what you think since you mailed this to Poor-MC,
right?)

    PS: Someone seems to have deleted the pooor-mc alias.

I don't think it ever really had that name, at least not for long.  I
suggested it, but I think somebody corrected my joke thinking it was a typo
almost instantly.

	This is a harmless message. The IP routing table (see PEEK 'W'
display) is a cache of the most recently used routes; when it fills up and
needs to add a new route, it punts the lest recently route. The message
is unnecessary. It would be good to notice if the cache is too small
(e.g. if the route discarded was used less than five minutes ago) and
log that; it might also be good to add a count of the number of cache
flushes and the number flushed in, say, the last hour.

If you run SYSMSG on MC you will generally find that the message buffer
is 90% full of messages of the form:

I presume this all means something to KLH and the rest of you TCP hackers,
but to me it is just an annoying amount of output that seems to be associated
no problem that I can see.  Is this a symptom of a real problem, or does it
just mean that some fixed size table should be made a little larger?  Or
perhaps we should consider not bothering the system console with this
common event, whatever it is.

        do you know about the ARx devices?

    I don't think those perform text compression, do they?

No, they don't.  They make a collection of small files take less space on
disk by removing the average of half a block of wasted space at the end of
every file.  They also take up less room in your directory because the
names of the files are stored in the archive itself, leaving only one entry
stored in your directory.

If you are looking for a program that compresses ASCII text by taking
advantage of the fact that certain sequences of characters are more common
than others, I think that Gail Zacharias (GZ@MC) has the best program for
this that I have seen.  I can't seem to find it at the moment though. Gail?

OZ doesn't have the hardware.  Your modem uses bell's 1200-baud

I suspect the recieved line at the front fakes GMSGS out when it tries to

Just another wierd case with echoing input at interrupt level.  ITS decides
how to do interrupt level echoing by looking at what job currently has
control of the TTY.  In this case DDT had control of the TTY for a few
moments while it typed the Argus message, so ITS echoed the two characters
you typed during those moments.  (I guess FR is looking at %TXPIE bits in
character to determine how to echo the user's typeahead.)

I'm suprised that FR and REPLY aren't handling %PIATY interrupts.  If they
were you wouldn't have seen this happen.  SEND seems to be hacking %PIATY;
why should SENDER vary this aspect of its behavior for replying vs. sending?

Getting any scheme like 2 to work is probably impossible.  What do you do
if the guy's terminal supports insert and delete character and yours
doesn't?  What about if his terminal is 5 lines longer than yours?  Even
virtual terminals have characteristics that are visible to the programs
that use them.

1 could be made to work I guess.  You would have to do it at the level of
%TD codes rather than ^P codes (since that is the only level at which there
is really a universal language).  There is a bunch of other things you have
to worry about I guess, like making sure the characters you type get echoed
in the way his program desires.  Given that it can only work some of the
time, and that it is pretty hard to get right, I can think of better things
to do with our time.

    things despite the similarity in names).  Second please distinguish between
    the various kind of escape codes in the ITS world; are you talking about ^P

    And fourth, is the TTY you are slaving logged-in or free, and what type
    (software, printing, AAA, etc.) is your TTY and the one you're slaving?

Ok.  Let me start over:

Luser :LUSERs me and tells me he can't run BABYL.  BABYL runs fine for
me on his mail file.  I'd like to ^_e him and poke around in the
debugger in his BABYL.  But all I get is ghubbish on my screen.

Two possible ways that ITS could get around this (and maybe both are
desirable for different circumstances):

1> I know he's on the same kind of terminal I am, so I want whatere
   goes down the wire to his terminal to go down the wire to mine.

2> I want the system to hack ^P codes for me so that I can poke around

Free vs logged-in isn't relevent to this, since you can :TCTYP a free
tty after sending a CALL through.

They are parity errors.  Nothing that we can do anything about except throw
the memory out the window.  Look at the bright side: some operating systems
would have halted the whole machine every time that happened, rather than
just stopping a few jobs.

I suppose we could make the message the user gets when he gets detached
this way more explicit, but it hardly seems worth the effort given that the
day is fast approaching when ITS will only run on KS10s, which (for the
moment at least) are more reliable hardware.

Due to total bloat of .MAIL.; LISTS   MSGS I have created .MAIL2 and moved
many non-essential files there.  Most of the queued mail is destined for OZ
which will hopefull be up sometime tomorrow (so they tell me).  COMSAT
features that would be nice in a situation like this:

	It would be nice to be able to tell COMSAT to take all mail
destined for a particular host and dump it all in some file somewhere and
forget about it for a few days.  Bouncing failed mail back to senders is
counter-productive in a situation like the current one.

	It would be nice if COMSAT was smarter about the finite directory
size.  For example, if it looks to COMSAT like there might not be room to
GC the LISTS MSGS file in place, it could output the new LISTS MSGS on a
different directory (effectively doubling the available room for a GC).

	Easiest of all, perhaps you could set things up so that LISTS MSGS
and the MAIL > files didn't live on the same directory?  Having COMSAT's GC
fighting for space with mail servers is moderately annoying at times.

time when it discovers that the clock has been reset no longer commands the
hacker to log in and run PDSET, instead it tells him that he should just
stick around a watch what happens in case he has to run it.  The demon will
print a message on the system console explaining what it did about the

There are servers on OZ, EE and XX.  SPEECH is up to JTW I guess.  The device
will deduce Speech from SPxxxx, so you could add "SP" to the table.

Right, OZKS: does KANSAS: so jobdev kansas can go if there is a space problem.

I think I have the output problem fixed, so I guess I'm finished.  Should I
install it somewhere other than my dir?

I doubt that the address space on ITS is up to it, especially as the 10 C

fix ITS so terminals with 128 different displayable codes can print

the oddity that control characters would echo down-arrow instead of ^

The DEVICE directory was getting a bit full.  The following three links
seemed to form a pattern.

  L   JOBDEV OZDNRF   ==> DEVICE;JOBDEV OZ        (7/18/85) GZ    
  L   JOBDEV OZKS     ==> DEVICE;JOBDEV OZ        (8/10/85) GZ    
  L   JOBDEV OZSS     ==> DEVICE;JOBDEV OZ        (8/13/85) GZ    

So I added OZ to the magic table in SYS:ATSIGN DEVICE so that -any- 4, 5,
or 6, character device name that starts with "OZ" automatically loads
DEVICE;JOBDEV OZ.  (AI, MC, ML and DM were already in the table.)  Then I
deleted the links.  There is also a link for a KANSAS: device.  Can we do
without this given that OZKS: works just as well?  Should I add XX and EE?
What about SPEECH?

How close are you to having this thing really working?  I haven't been able
to use it to -write- a file yet, although I have been using it to read all
kinds of things.  (There don't seem to be many other people using the Emacs
built on the long filename Teco, but it hasn't given me any problems at
all.  I guess once you think the device is "released" you can announce it
together with the new Emacs.  (I guess I should think about a long filename
version of MacLisp...))

LOUIE.UDEL.EDU appears to be looping back mail for several lists,

just add more loops.  As a temporary measure I have put LOUIE in
the LUZRS table for SYSBIN;FTPS BIN.  This will cause all SMTP and FTP

is a desperation measure and a better remedy would be to add some
smarts to COMSAT so that mail from there can be set aside for a while.
I don't have the time right now for this.  If someone is offended by the
unilateral censorship they can just put a zero back in LUZRS.

    By the way, how does the system know about sharable pure pages?
    If it knows that much why doesn't it know about binaries' filenames?

It's because the concept of a "file" exists only at a higher level of
abstraction than the level where page sharing is done.  Sharing is done at
the level of pages and disk blocks.  A file is a name for a sequence of
disk blocks, but there is no way to go backwards from a disk address to see
which file (if any) it came from.  (Other than mapping over the entire
filesystem.)  If there was some reason this operation needed to be done
with great regularity, the information could be saved.  But it is rare to
want to do that, so we don't.  

(I actually have a tool that does it since I needed it once for debugging
disk ECC recovery on AI.  I think there might also be a routine in the
version of the salvager that runs under timesharing that does it.)

    I snarfed an emacs from a hactro and tried to do <alt>G
    "no start address" I don't know if this is a DDT bug or an ITS bug.

It isn't exactly anybody's bug.  The start address of a program is treated
just like the symbol table.  It is stored in binary files for the benefit
of people who load, start, and/or debug the program, but it is not kept
anywhere in the job itself.  ITS doesn't concern itself with where you
think a job should be restarted.

Now it -is- a little inconvenient that there is no way to go from a random
job you find floating around the system back to its binary to find its
symbols and starting address.  So let me float a few suggestions through
the air and see if anybody thinks they are a good idea:

(1) Add a user variable that would contain a starting address.  This would
    cover the common case that Devon complained about.  (Happens to me all
    the time too.)

(2) Add four user variables that would contain the filename of the binary
    for the this job.  This would enable symbols to be found as well as the
    start address.

(3) Add a user variable that contains the address of a block in the job's
    address space, in some extensible format we design later, that contains
    all kinds of information.  Like a vector of start addresses, filenames
    of binary files, etc.

(4) Since (3) requires cooperation from the job itself, but (1) covers the
    most common case, we could do both.  One user variable containing a
    start address and one containing the address of a block of information
    (or zero if the job doesn't have one).  Note that these are both 18 bit
    quantities, so this really only adds an extra word to every set of job
    variables.

A problem with (3) and (4) is that the new info-block user variable seems
somehow redundant with the existing use of the left half of .40ADDR.  The
16.-word block addressed by LH(.40ADDR) is currently only used for
temporary hacking by a job's superior; perhaps there is some way to combine
the two?  Perhaps one of the words addressed by RH(.40ADDR) can be the
info-block pointer if the job sets some bit in .OPTION?

I guess I'm in favor of at least (1) if not some variant of (4).

That's pretty wierd all right.  ITS should never do that unless you are on
a tty line with %TYMDM set, and only T01 and T03 through T17 have that set in
the current ITS.  That bit -used- to be set for the Rolm lines, but that is
no longer the case because MC wasn't finding out about hangups.  Perhaps
there is something more fundamentally wrong with the hangup detection code?

SOPEN parsed the string as "DSK:GZ;GZ >" since the trailing space fooled it

------------
This discussion belongs on BUG-MAIL; please edit BUG-ITS from the
distribution of further messages (if any).

I am surprised that there are still people at this time who are
confused about the difference between a return path and a From
field.  The return path information given in the SMTP "SEND FROM"
command is not equivalent to the "From" field in a message header.
The return path is located on the ENVELOPE and the From field is
located in the header portion of the mail DATA.  RFC810 specifies:
"The SEND command requires that the mail data be delivered to the
user's terminal."  (Note that although an SMTP module may add a
field called Return-path in the header of a message it processes,
this feature is a transmission relay trace intended for debugging.)
The message recipient is not supposed to reply to the return path,
which is not really intended for humans; rather, the return path is
for use by SMTPs to generate error receipts.  If other systems are
using the return path in place of a header, then they are buggy.

It might be a feature for MC's SMTP to retain the return path for
the user, but if the message did not have a header it would still
be buggy; personally, I think adding the return path to incoming
sends clutters them up and wastes the reader's time.  This is why
most people's mail reading programs prune any return path fields
in the header from the message display.

It is definitely LLL-CRG which is violating protocol here.

Chris

PS. Early this year I reported this missing header bug to the TOPS-20
    mail system maintainers (then on SU-SCORE). Their response was
    that they should be putting headers on their outgoing sends, and
    that their system was broken.  I believe they fixed the bug, but
    I have since noticed that many TOPS-20 sites did not pick up this
    fix and have some old buggy SEND command.  Apparently Unix is
    distrbuted with this bug too. Maybe this explains your perception
    about MC being the only site which "throws away" the data.

get modified a lot and would otherwise have the potential

    I was able to log both ends of a telnet connection (using TOPS-20 TN here,
    and the ITS datagram logger on MC) and captured an instance of the lossage.
    MC is sending a repacketized segment which TOPS-20 incorrectly treats as
    additional data.  That is, MC's TCP sends off three separate segments, and
    then when no ACK is received it decides to retransmit, but is clever and
    lumps all the data together into a single segment which it then retransmits.
    This new segment has the proper sequence number (same as seq # of the
    original 1st segment).  The data in this segment is exactly that data
    which is duplicated in TN's log file.  The only possible explanation is
    that the TOPS-20 monitor's TCP code has a long-standing bug in it.

    It now occurs to me that I have seen this before when TN'ing to a VAX
    4.2BSD system.  I always blamed the BSD code for this, and other people
    claimed this was due to a bug in 4.2 server telnet, but somehow it never
    seemed to go away.  Looks as if this was actually a TOPS-20 bug!

    I will pursue this with the appropriate people.

Many too many implementations have the "Doesn't correctly handle
overlapping segments" bug.  The trickiest one is receiving a segment
some of whose data has already been acknowledged and some whose is new.

To: BUG-ITS@MIT-MC.ARPA
Message-ID: <[MIT-MC.ARPA].594867.850731.CSTACY>

Some time back I had reported a problem where when I first connected
to MC, the first few characters of each line appeared to be garbage.
This only happenned on dialup lines and would persist until I set the
terminal type. It really looked like ITS had initialized my TTY to
some wrong type -- the illegible graphics symbols appearing on my AAA
screen were likely-looiking control codes or padding.  I didn't want
to believe that the TTY code was broken, and some other people
asserted that my problem was not possibly the fault of ITS.  
Well, the other day I mentioned to my roomate that I was going to go
take a look at TS3TTY and convince myself it could not possibly be
broken.  He responded by pouring over the AAA terminal documentation
and frobbing the terminal, and finally located the real culprit.
Apparently the AAA has this feature (which we had enabled) where you
can turn some bit on if you desire the first few characters of each
line to be trashed for you.

So, this message is just a response for the record about that old bug
report I filed.  The ITS TTY code was *not* at fault.

Well, with considerable pain I was able to cause an example of
this lossage while keeping a TCP datagram log.  However, the log
doesn't show what I expected; I was looking for the stretch of
duplicated text that I observed, and couldn't find it.  There are
some retransmissions but they are all correct.

Until GSB commented on the fact that the extra stuff seemed to be
a duplicate of previous stuff, I hadn't noticed this attribute, but
since then I've checked every instance and this appears to be always
true.  Something somewhere is being retransmitted or re-used.

Since this happens with both CTN (CRTSTY SUPDUP) and TOPS-20 TN,
it isn't a TOPS-20 user-program problem.  Since the outgoing datagram log on
MC shows no problems, the obvious deduction is that this looks like a
TOPS-20 monitor problem.  As it happens, the duplicated stuff does appear
to correspond to a re-packetized TCP segment.  More tests will be
necessary to confirm this, however.

This also implies that GSB's problem is actually something different
from this one.  Since he mentioned it happening with PEEK, I think
we should confine further discussion to BUG-ITS and leave out
BUG-RMAIL,TECO,EMACS unless more information turns up.

While I was at it I gave both devices a new feature.  They now support
deletion so you can delete items from the queue.  For example, if 7LP^F
shows you the following:

then you can delete job 905 by doing either ^O 7LP:905 or ^O 7LP:ALAN.  In
the later case all entries owned by ALAN are deleted.  The second filename

I'm not sure where the fault for this one might be, hence the shotgun
message.

In RMAIL, when using "space" to step through successive screenfuls
of a long message, sometimes output fails to stop at the mode line;
it continues for several more lines and runs right off the bottom of
the screen, causing the terminal to either scroll or wrap up to
the top (depending on one's terminal).  The screen is then permanently
messed up until a complete redisplay is forced with ^L.

This happens for me when connected to MC either via SUPDUP (ie as a
software TTY) or via TELNET with a :TCTYP DM2500 declaration.  At
first I thought it might be a CRTSTY/SUPDUP problem, but my TELNET
experiments have convinced me that it really is MC's fault.
However, I haven't been able to find a foolproof way of reproducing
the lossage.  All I can say is that in the course of reading through
several SF-LOVERS digests on a 24x79 screen, this bug almost always
crops up someplace, sometimes twice or thrice in a row.  I type:
	N E ^K ^X r				; to invoke RMAIL
	<spaces as needed to read msg> d	; for each message

This is probably a TECO bug of some variety, but there's an off
chance it might be an ITS TTY handling bug.  It's even possible
that some EMACS code is screwing up the redisplay.  This has happened
for quite a while (several months).  I hope someone else has a
notion of what to look for at this point.  If necessary, I could
try again to save a reproducible instance of this, although it is
a rather painful task.

	I'm dubious about this being a side effect of DEC playing around.
The exact thing DEC did involved no frobbing with cables at all; all the
did was disable some of the ports the processor was using to reference
memory. (I was supposed to explain all this but forgot).
	What they did was notice that we are running the machine in
two way interleave. Exactly why we are doing this is too long to explain
here, and I think Dave Moon did so once already. This being the case,
they decided that we would be less likely to have 'interference' on the
memories if we diabled KBUS2 and KBUS3 (which are after all duplicates of
KBUS0 and KBUS1 in two way interleave). I'm not sure I believe this, but
I do believe that it can't hurt and I didn't feel like arguing with the
DEC guy about it, so I let them do it. (Actually, they disabled the
memory ports to those busses, not the busses.)
	However, the DF10 has it's own memory bus and port, and should
not have been affected. It's probably a flaky caused by all the power
cycling in the last week.

It is probably a bug that ITS refuses all Chaosnet service
when it is being debugged.  There is a feature in NETWRK
for doing this in the Chaosnet specific code.  SYSDBG is
maybe not quite fine-grain enough?  Also, should move
TCPUSW and TCPUP to be near NETUSW, etc.

JNC and I swapped the packs in unit 3 and 4 on MC (the rightmost two
T-300's) and the disk problems we were experiencing vanished.  Perhaps
there is some marginal interaction between drives and packs formatted with
different alignments?  If so, I guess there is some hope that things will
clear up after duplicating those packs tomorrow.

BUG-ITS:  For the record:  Earlier today JNC and TY brought MC up with
-none- of the T-300's because they believed them all to be broken.  They
were given this impression when UCOP got an error copying some user
directories.  In fact, it has been true for a long time that there are bad
blocks amoung the directories on those packs, but since we don't
really need those extra copies of the directories this is OK.  UCOP copies
the MFD -first-, and if it gets that far, that is good enough!

    Everybody here is waiting for the system to run, all of the hackers in
    Stockholm that have heard of ITS is lyric.

    I have started the work on planing howto actualy change the KA hardware,
    i want to have the posibility to run as much of the DEC diagnostics as
    possible. So some type of switch-selectable aproach is prefered, but it
    is no simple.

    In a month or so we shall try to have the two KI-10 Cpu:s running
    SMP with T10 7.02. We plan to use this system to assemble the ITS code.


    (       Are you sure you can deal with that volume of mail?  I don't think
	    anyone will mind your being on them if you don't mind.
    )

    Pls try to add:  ITS_bugs%QZCOM.MAILNET@MIT-MULTICS.ARPA
    in both ITS bugs and ITS on ks20.

I have done so.

    Will report as soon there is any sucsess.

We eagerly await your report.  The box of tapes, processor prints, and
documentation is sitting right next to me, thanks to a lot of work by
Penny Berman.

    MC was really wedged this afternoon.  Every minute it kept typing
    system full, 0 pages, 0 qsk channels, etc.  No user jobs able to run.
    Warm booting didn't help so I took a dump to CRASH FULL and
    cold-booted, which seems to have fixed things.

Well, the crash dump shows an ITS that has been up for 5 minutes and is
having trouble initializing the first T-300.  So I guess this is the
canonical T-300 controller lossage.

    A little bit more on the recent lossage I mentioned earlier...

    I was logged in when RHB got wedged.  Running Peek, I could see
    that his job and several others were sitting there with a state
    of "*logout", whatever that means.  Peek could not gun his tree,
    nor could Lock.

A state of "LOGOUT" (the "*" is irrelevant really) means that the job was
already on its way towords going away.  (Thats why gunning it didn't do
anything, it was already as gunned as it could get.)  Without a crash dump,
or an actual wedged system, I can only guess that this is another symptom
of the T-300 lossage.

There were several different HACTRNs sitting around in this state,

of lispm file jobs.  I don't know enough about lispm file jobs to tell
whether these were normal or not.

About two minutes later my tty got wedged, and I can't log back in

I'm having an intermittent problem of the terminal getting wedged when I log
in.  The symptoms are as follows.

Pword runs ok, and my login file starts executing.  At some point, either as
the login file ends, or at a point most of the way through it where I have a
:more query about whether to run babyl or not, almost all response to typed
characters stops.  The only characters that cause a response are ctrl-G and
rubout which provoke their usual behaviour.

My login file has not been changed in months.  Other people logging in from
the same concentrator (NPLASMA) have not seen the problem.  I get the problem
four or five times in a row, then everything is fine again.

You may find this news hard to believe.

As you may recall, the source for STINK didn't assemble properly,
and had a higher version number than the (presumably working) binary.
The true source, if it ever existed, has been lost in the distant
fires of ITS dump tapes being burned at the stake.

I was thinking about a possible hack which at some point might require
the services of STINK.  Never mind what it is.  The problem as I saw
it was not the fact that STINK is unique and unsupported, but the
fact that STINK could not be supported without a real source.  So
I made a half-hearted attempt to investigate by comparing the (faulty)
result of an assembly with the existing binary, using SRCCOM's /$
switch.

Boy, am I glad I put that hack into SRCCOM.  The comparison much to
my surprise showed the binaries were virtually identical, except for
one changed label and a couple of missing symbols.  It only took a few
minutes to fix those and come up with a source that assembles into
exactly the same thing (modulo .FNAM2) as the old TS STINK!

Anyway, I wrote out this new source as STINK 200, and installed a new
TS STINK.  STINK lives again!  (phew)

This was because COMSAT assumes that the DEAD-MAIL-RECEIPTS list

anything, things are back to normal now, and I re-installed the

Under certain conditions (such as fatal interrupts) AUTPSY comes out

AI's COMSAT is stuck in a deadly loop. whenever it is launched, it
first, of course, tries to cut down on the queued msgs by sending one
of them. trouble is, the single one in its queue is to BUG-INQUIR@MC
(alias CSTACY) and COMSAT thinks it's from DEAD-MAIL-RECEIPTS@AI.  so
after sending it (it does get through, each time; cstacy now has
several of these in his mail) COMSAT tries to give a CMSG to
DEAD-MAIL-RECEIPTS@AI. there is no such address, so COMSAT says
::=<ignored>. then it tries to CMSG again to the same address. after
several times, it dies after just saying CMSG.

BURNUP 1 was the first corpse dumped by this process. BURNUP 8 is the
latest of several all of the same size (each died after only this work
on the queue, while #1 included previous activity).  I tried writing a
new NAMES > with the guilty address eqv'd to NUL:, as it is on MC;
COMSAT did not try to compile this before working on the queued mail.
BURNUP 9 is COMSAT dying after i renamed LIST EQV (the bin of NAMES >)
to something else; again, COMSAT did not look for the names database
before hacking the queued mail. this is a gross bug and should be
fixed; if there is no names database, maybe it's for a good reason,
like the previous one is fuckt and someone wants comsat to pick up the
new (hopefully cured) version. BURNUP 10 is from another experiment: i
tried renaming LISTS MSGS to something else, COMSAT looked for NMSGS,
found none, and died.

alan and moon tried to debug this over the phone, but couldn't get
enough data (AUTPSY kept containing 0 !). i have renamed AI:COMSAT
LAUNCH to COMSAT BRUNCH. ai now has enough pieces of mail that it
won't accept any more from outside. COMSAT should not be relaunched
on AI until someone fixes this.

I wasn't able to figure out the problem in detail, but I did edit
a bug trap into the source at MGRD2.  Sometime you should exhibit
the problem with me physically present and I'll patch in this bug

    To: GSB at MIT-ML, CENT at MIT-ML
    fyi the location to patch to disable tape read errors
    in ITS is MGMRT+1 which is changd from JRST MGERR to JRST MGRD2.
    It still tries a few times to retry errors but if it gets a fatal
    error it gives you whatever shitty data it got instead of barfing..
    ^_
then tried again with the tape. dump worked on tape a short while, with
some hiccupping and one reported error, then system died. crash dump in
CRASH IMRQ8. alan poked around at the code and thinks that possibly the
patch is fucking up the MEMBLT table...

	There was some breeze-shooting on the subject of speeding
up the DZ output interrupt service routines which I thought I'd
note down. Since a 9600 baud line running flat out generates
1000 interrupts/second, and the output ISR looks quite long at
the moment, a few lines running flat out will probably bring
the machine to its knees.
	The theory is that we should implement efficient block mode
output; i.e. the driver emulates a DMA device and takes big chunks of
data each time ITS talks to it. We should blow some of the extra
register sets that we have, one per DZ. 8 of the registers would be
used for things like holding a pointer to the registers, etc, and
temps, and the other 8 would be pointers to output buffers.
	The pointers would probably be AOBJN style pointers, with the
data uppacked one byte per word. (We can't use byte pointers because
there isn't any room for a count if so and there aren't enough
registers to have counts too, unless we restrict ourselves to 4
general registers and keep the counts in halfwords.) At that
point, the output ISR would be about 10 instructions long:

	OPBASE = 6		;Base of AOBJN pointer block in regs

	IORDI A,%DZRCS(D)	;Get CSR
	TRNN A,%DZCTR		;Transmitter ready?
	  JRST LOSE		;No, spurious interrupt
	LDB A,[.BP %DZLM,A]	;Get line number
	MOVE T,OPBASE(A)	;Get AOBJN pointer for that line
	MOVE TT,(T)		;Pick up data
	IOWRI TT,%DZRTD(D)	;Write it out
	AOBJP T,DONE		;All done yet?
	MOVEM T,OPBASE(A)	;Put updated pointer back
	JRST 12,@TTYBRK		;Dismiss

	Or something like that, anyway.

I guess it is unlikely, but it would be foolish of anyone else to try to

chance to come in and install and verify the new microcode.  The macros in
KSDEFS are gone and have been replaced with the new I/O instructions I

    As in the previous case, the involved code has been stable for

I remember tracking down and patching the pword lock at least once

    Re:   No logins

    PWORD was getting MPV's. I couldn't fix this (and backing up to
    an older PWORD didn't fix it) so I temporarily flushed PWORD
    and replaced it with DDT so that at least people could log in.

Although JNC doesn't think so, I am convinced that he was faked out by
a bug in PEEK which sometimes causes it to print out "MPV not handled"
when it screws up.

When I went and ran PWORD, I did not get any kind of MPV problems, but
I did get hung after the command prompt.  Somehow, the lock word in
the password database was set and never cleared, so all jobs would
.HANG forever as soon as they tried to access the database.  The job
which had claimed the database was long gone.  I patched the password
database back into working order and re-installed PWORD.

The code for PWORD has not been changed in a long time, so I suspect
that some kind of hardware problem (or human) somehow screwed up the
ITS locks critical routine feature, or munged the database.

MC has been up all morning, but refuses to establish
proper connections for incoming network telnets and supdups.
Dialups also appear flaky, but I'm not sure about this.

Symptoms - you get the telser message "MC Maximum Confusion PDP-10"
and then nothing.

Finger from another site shows lots of un-logged-in HACTRNs sitting
there.  Note that outgoing chtn, telnet, supdup are fine.
Incoming finger is fine too.

ITS was unable to get any bits through for long enough to open a
connection.  Noel found a similar chip to the broken one in a chaosnet
interface.  We (me, jtw, jnc) yanked it and installed it (the same hack was
apparently done five years ago).

As this is the second one to fail, it is likely that another one will soon,
and that the board may not appreciate being frobbed like this yet another
time.  I might make another isolator board sometime before the end of the

mc tripped and fell down this morning.  As might be expected, the system
console hardcopy for the previous hour was all overprinted on a single line.
There was a parity error light on in the ampex (penny recorded this in the
log).

Cold booting worked until it checked NXM, when it decided that most
(but not all) of the two high MH10s were not there.  The memory was
listed in a large number of randomly sized chunks.  Power cycling
those two cabinets didn't help.  (The overtemp light had been on in C
-- don't know if it had been on as of when the machine went down.)
Deselecting them seemed to be a good idea and seems to be working...

Since the machine was up, and seeing the time, i decided to pass off

    A file's author is currently apparently set from the UNAME of the writing
    job.  (I surmise, I haven't looked at the code yet.)  Perhaps the XUNAME
    should be used instead?

Here's the previous discussion of this:

    Date: Saturday, 15 September 1984, 12:06-EDT
    From: David A. Moon <Moon at SCRC-TENEX>

	Date: 14 September 1984 21:00-EDT
	From: Christopher C. Stacy <CSTACY @ MIT-MC>

	M-X Copy File does not preserve authors on ITS.
	It does preserve reference date (although maybe it should
	use DNRF instead of referencing the file to copy it) and
	the creation date.

    This is because the routine CLOSIT in the FILE job sets the author of the
    file it just wrote to the user's HSNAME.  Evidently it does this because
    the FILE job doesn't login under the name of the user who is using it.
    We can do one of
     (1) Make the FILE job login under the right name.
     (2) Make ITS set the file author from the XUNAME instead of the UNAME and
	 make the file job set its XUNAME to the user's name instead of to
	 a copy of its UNAME.
     (3) Make the FILE job set the author when it opens the file instead of
	 when it closes it.
    Suggestions?
    -------
    Kerns suggests doing #3 or making ITS set the author from HSNAME instead
    of the UNAME.  That sounds good except what about ^S?

Last week I thought, mistakenly, that using ^S to run EMACS on
another's terminal would make me be the author of files that I write.
I think it should.  Hence:

  - ITS should set the author of the file to the HSNAME.
  - The file job should set its HSNAME to that of the user on whose
    behalf it is acting.
  - The file job shouldn't set the author gratuitously.

In the above, HSNAME would be XUNAME were it not for the fact that authors
are stored as directory numbers rather than as sixbit strings.

Anyone disagree?

Speaking of historically interesting files I propose that certain
MC/AI/ML backup tapes that would otherwise be discarded be put into
the MIT archives and/or the CCC facility. Example: CCC has an Imlac,
and I was showing Gill the :IMLOAD program and the IMLAC directory,
but of course the IMLAC directory was reaped long ago. But since CCC
has an old IBM 7 track drive they could actually make good use of the
tapes with the IMLAC stuff.  Personally I'm interested in seeing old
snapshots of conniver, planner, rabbit, etc, all of which are on
backup tape.

    We can probably get access to a 7-track tape drive to read your tapes
    on, but we need some information about the format, like a backup program
    that we can read on a TOPS-10 or TOPS-20 machine. Even a listing would be
    helpful.

    Also, we would like to know what kind of tape drive and controller
    you are using, and if you use standard DEC core-dump format.

If you can read 7-track tapes in DEC core-dump format, we can send you
ITS dump tapes of all the relevant files, including the Midas assembler
and binaries of Midas that will run on Tops-10.  (I guess the right
thing would be to include Tops-20 binaries of Midas as well).  It will
probably be six or seven reels of tape.  The format is as simple as
could be, I expect we can send you a 1/2 page writeup describing it
along with the tapes.  Or I can send you a one-sentence writeup right
now: The files are delimited by tape file-marks; each file starts with a
header, which starts with an "aobjn pointer", and contains its name in
sixbit and some other stuff; the rest of the file is just the file, as
36-bit words; at the front of the tape is another header, also starting
with an "aobjn pointer", giving the tape name and some other stuff.

    Does anyone over there have an ITS tape? 

It's been three weeks since you sent your message (I'm behind on my mail).
Was it ever clarified what type of tape drive you have and what formats
of tape you can read?  It's possible that we may have to write a 9-track
Tops-10/Tops-20 Interchange format tape for you, which would be possible
for us to do but would take a fair amount of work.  With the recent episode
of vandalism and destruction, there is only one running ITS machine in the
world and it has a 7-track tape drive.

Last year for archival purposes I dumped all the ITS and utility program
sources on two reels of 9-track, 3200-bpi tape in a format that you
definitely don't have a program to read.  Two copies of those tapes
exist in separate locations.  It is not inconceivable that I could make
another copy.  That might be useful, since the separate locations are
only three miles apart and hence could both be destroyed simultaneously.

    ... In the meantime we have gotten another
    machine, a KI10, which has been up and running several months.
    It runs a slightly modified TOPS-10 V7.02 (which isn't supposed
    to run on KI at all), and we have managed to simulate some
    KL instructions, for example ADJSP. We are planning hardware
    modifications so we can do ADJBP too. But TOPS-10 is not very
    exciting, so we have been thinking about getting up TENEX, or
    even TOPS-20. Do you know any place we can get a KI10 TENEX monitor?

I think it would be considerably less work to get ITS running on a KI10
than to get it running on a KS10.  The biggest difference between the
stock KI10 and the ITS-modified KA10 is that the KI10 paging is less
flexible (no split page tables between the upper and lower half of
user address space); but a small amount of software simulation could
handle that; certainly it wouldn't be as bad as what it takes to get
Tenex to run on the KI10.  Or you could fix the hardware, which evidently
you have the capability to do.

Want to have a race?  It wouldn't really be very fair, since there are
only a couple of very part-time people working on the KS10 here.

    Does BBN still run TENEX? Any pointers would be appreciated.

A perhaps little-known fact is that Symbolics still runs TENEX, on
a Foonly F-2.  I've been campaigning to get that machine thrown off the
roof for quite a while now, but unfortunately there are still people
using it.

    Just a event to ponder.  The other day I supduped from MC back to MC
    (presumably using Chaosnet, I didn't think to check), and I was greeted
    with the following:

        S.1487. PWORD.2630.
        TTY 52
        12. Lusers, Fair Share = 6%

        MC IT*

    Note that five characters ("MC IT") have been displaced.  Conceivably the
    fact that the machine was so heavily loaded, and that the user and server
    were both on the same machine, could have allowed some timing screw that
    almost never happens normally.

This is not new.  The phenomenon has existed for several years and was
first noticed on the AI KA-10 when telnet connections would sometimes produce
scrambled initial prompts.  I don't think anyone has made a serious effort
to identify the bug.  It could be in either the telnet server or in the
ITS STY code.  This would be a good case for any mystery lovers to investigate.

Thanks to whoever put in received lines.  They are very helpful in
tracing the path of a message.

Could they be altered slightly to conform to the RFC822 spec for such
fields?   It would be much easier to read if it were consistent with
the rest of the Received lines a message might contain.

Here is an excerpt from the RFC which specifies the order of the fields:

     received    =  "Received"    ":"            ; one per relay
                       ["from" domain]           ; sending host
                       ["by"   domain]           ; receiving host
                       ["via"  atom]             ; physical path
                      *("with" atom)             ; link/mail protocol

    Someone at SCRC just tried to send me a message from a host not
    in our tables; he was refused by our server.  I bet that the server
    died trying to look it up.   I'll make it say CHAOS|nnnn or something.


OK, I fixed this so that the Chaosnet SEND server will claim the
message came from a host named like "24516/CHAOS".

It occurred to me that it would be nice to be able to REPLY to these
guys too, so I went and hacked up the NETWRK library to accept various
numerical host names.  (There was some code in NETWRK to parse some of
these, but it was pretty broken and looked like it could never have worked.)

Then I hacked up SENDER a little, mostly to know about the following
poorly documented return convention of NETWRK"HSTLOOK: even if A gets
a host address, B may contain zero rather than a database pointer.

I also reassembled TELNET with the new NETWRK.  With the right
switches set, programs will now parse all these equivalent forms:

   MIT-AI       ; symbolic
   10.2.0.6     ; Internet address
   2/6          ; Host 2 on IMP 6.
   3130/CHAOS   ; (Other nets work too: 400006/ARPA is MIT-AI,
                                        77/SATNET is GOONHILLY-ECHO)


If anything mysterious starts happenning with programs as they are
re-assembled with the new NETWRK, let me know.

    it's been a long time since we said anything; sorry (at least we could
    have said it would take a long while or something). a chief problem
    that i have heard some of the hackers here mention about running ITS
    on your system is that the hardware list you sent does not include a
    paging box (i'm not sure what number that would be -- perhaps DM10 --
    someone will jump on me if i'm wrong).

Um, actually it's not a DEC frob at all, so it hasn't got a number. The
ones which were used at MIT were built either by us or Systems Concepts,
I believe. ITS paging is somewhat different than TOPS-10, both of which
are completely different than TENEX/TOPS-20.

On the other hand, it might be possible to pound on your KI10 enough
to get it to do ITS paging using the KI's paging hardware. The page
tables are of different format, the pages are larger, and of course
page faults are reported to the OS differently.


    also the ITS sources are not
    neatly available already on a single tape; someone would have to go
    through things and figure out what to send you, and we have all been
    sort of busy (we work full time on other things, or are students,
    etc.)

Hmmm, if they have a TOPS-10 running, they at least have something to
run MIDAS on. It's a start. Maybe when the KS is done things will be in
one place...

    i think BBN flushed their last tenex last spring; not sure who
    you could ask there for further details.
    
They did. There are still a few of them running around the Arpanet
though. If you can get the right paging hardware to run TENEX you
actually have a pretty good chance of getting TOPS-20 up, if you can
find a set of version 3 or 4 sources. You would either have to change
a lot of code or change the way traps and such work on the KI though.
For TENEX, I'd start by trying to get the latest sources from BBN,
presumably they still have them around.

It's more complicated than that.  We don't use the RSX-11 file system,
we use the KLDCP file system which DEC later flushed..  Also the front-end
files aren't in any one place on the disk, but are scattered all
over.  Some of them, especially the larger ones, reside in individual ITS
files, others are pieces portions of an ITS file.  And if you move or delete
anything on the .KLFE. directory you screw it up since somewhere there is
a KLDCP directory containing absolute disk addresses.
You could make the .KLFE. dir be proetcedt and also make KLFEDR tattle itself
somehow.

	I parsed that correctly the second time. Yes, there does seem
to be this file KLDCP (DIR) which macgically contains the actual blocks
of the RSX-11 directory. So you will get the miscreants name (if done
under ITS), but not which file he bashed.

Huh? I put the file back into the front-end file system,
and it has been working for a couple of days.

	It's not clear if this will do the right thing, since presumably
the file was also deleted from the RSX-11 directory, which would have used 
KLFEDR or whatever the fuck that program is called. In fact, you could
delete it with KLFEDR and not touch the directory entry in .KLFE. I guess.

The front end file NTSDDT seems to have been deleted over the weekend.
I re-created it; you can boot the system normally now.
I also made the front-end file directory be tattled on by the system job.

NE438B, NE438C, and NE437A have terminal lines running open
or something.  They keep generating a lot of noise, some of
which is control-Zs, so they are connecting to MC and typing
the noise at us.  This eats up network resources and prevents
some people from logging in,etc.  I heard that the power company
is being flaking today, which may have something to do with it.

You are probably getting memory parity errors.

Two or three times in the last day or so I've gotten

top level interrupt, tree detached

This usually happens when I have been typing ^Z's and ^G's because
the system is not responding.  Now I have a dead detached tree.
I can usually type ^_'s to prove that the system itself is alive
even though nothing is responding.

OK, FTP servers now die cleanly if they don't know the time.

        is mc's arpa connection busted?  can't reach it from rutgers 
        or xx via internet.
    It does for me at the moment.

I guess you can tell from this that Chris reads his mail in reverse!

    System went down at 6:25am this morning. Whoever brought it back up
    forgot to set the time so mostly no one could log in.

And MC hasn't been talking TCP since then, because the tables were clogged
with a zillion dead FTP servers because of the silly .VALUE-when-ITS-
doesn't-know-the-time screw I reported a couple weeks ago.

Just a event to ponder.  The other day I supduped from MC back to MC
(presumably using Chaosnet, I didn't think to check), and I was greeted
with the following:

    S.1487. PWORD.2630.
    TTY 52
    12. Lusers, Fair Share = 6%

    MC IT*

Note that five characters ("MC IT") have been displaced.  Conceivably the
fact that the machine was so heavily loaded, and that the user and server
were both on the same machine, could have allowed some timing screw that
almost never happens normally.
