Subject: Athena chaos address fakeout, HOSTS3 compiler broken.
To: INFO-HOSTS@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU
Message-ID: <[MC.LCS.MIT.EDU].851075.860314.SRA>

1) The chaosnet address of ATHENA in the newest HSTMIT is a lie.
   The address listed is really a different project athena machine.
   ENS@ATHENA and I did this because Athena itself is off the chaosnet
   for an indefinite time due to hardware lossage beyond their control.
   So this way mail will get through without having to go via MC, but
   trying to SUPDUP or TELNET to Athena via chaos will lose.  Sorry.

2) The HOSTS3 compiler has run out of address space again, so it won't
   be possible to generate new HOSTS3 binary files until I figure out
   some new class of hosts or nicknames that can be safely pruned from
   HSTNIC.  PDP10s (and vaxen who port HOSTS2.TXT files from XX or OZ)
   beware.

    i recently noticed that SLOAN has aqcuired XV as an alternate name, or
    nickname, or whatever, so have just implemented your above request for
    address change. it took me -this long- to grasp the pun; i must be slowing
    down.

at that time i had in fact changed your entry; until i commented it out
yesterday, this is how it read:
(header-people-incoming @XV)	; req. of Kevin@SLOAN Crowston 1sep85

now, this is what the host table says about the host in question:
HOST : 18.86.0.4 : SLOAN.MIT.EDU,MIT-SLOAN.ARPA,MIT-SLOAN,SLOAN,XV.MIT.EDU,MIT-XV.ARPA,MIT-XV,XV : DANDELION : INTERLISP ::

the host table thinks XV and SLOAN are the same thing. clearly the host
table, not the Header-People list, is what is confused.  i suggest that you
arrange to have the host table fixed with respect to the Sloan host(s).

Subject: Cretinous lossage

Some pinhead put a bunch of EECS hosts into the HSTAI table
(presumably by putting them into Reagan's namespace).  This causes the
host table compiler to barf, since the culprit didn't get all the
names right and there are primary name mismatches.

Host tables will be disfunctional until this is fixed at the source,
since I am not about to start a namespace war with a Lisp Machine.

Chris, you might want to install a filter in Reagan's table dump
program so that it won't propagate this kind of lossage.

I commented out the IP address for VAX.LCS.MIT.EDU (VX).  As the

vaugely reflects reality, I just went ahead and did this by fiat
without waiting for VX's owners to give me permission (or more
accurately, I timed out while waiting for a useful answer to my
queries).  This change will affect the MIT HOSTS3 and HSTMIT files
(and anything that is generated from them) and the LCS.MIT.EDU domain.
It will *not* affect the NIC tables, so we can change things back
quietly if/when VX's TCP/IP code becomes reliable enough to use for
mail on a regular basis.

Anybody who wants to change this back please talk to me first.  There
are some issues involved that are not readily apparent.

I turned off the code that was generating the names like
MIT-foo.MIT.EDU and foo.MIT.EDU (for hosts that are in some other
domain, ie, AI or LCS).  This was necessary because COMSAT was
completely out of address space and I needed the few K this freed up
just to keep COMSAT running.

This means that (1) host tables will be a little smaller, and that (2)
it is possible that you will be unable to reply to hosts that are
still using these names (nobody should be, but they still linger in
some dark corners).  If you need a table that has all this cruft, you
can get the binary from XX:<SYSTEM>HOSTS3.BIN and the text form of
HSTMIT from XX:<HOSTS>HSTMIT.TXT.

Sorry for the short (one might even say negative) notice, but this was
an emergency fix.

The new tables that have been running on XX on an experimental basis
have now been installed on MC and AI.  A few things to note:

At CSTACY's request, the tables no longer live in MC: SYSNET; because
the directory got too crowded.  All the text files have been moved to
MC: SYSHST;.  The old versions of the host tables are still present in
SYSNET; on the off chance that we have to back out of this, but they
will be going away soon.  The binary host table of course is still in
SYSBIN;.

There is a little bit of documentation in some of the files in SYSHST;
ask me if you need help, I would much rather have to answer a lot of
silly questions than have to pick up the pieces if somebody breaks all
this.

For those who deleted my last warning on this subject, the new host
table is significantly larger than the old one.  Some programs on your
machine will probably barf and need to be recompiled.  Sorry.

Problems, flames, etc to me and NAMECALLERS.

	One other thing we should try and tackle in an organised
fashion is allocation of host numbers on wires. Right now, it's
done by looking through the host tables, which aren't organized in
any useful fashion for this; in addition, some people chose a number,
look to see if anyone has that number in protocol family X, and
don't check to see if anyone is using it in family Y, with the
result that a single host number winds up on two machines, with
all the attendant hassle.
	Shawn keeps files for the LCS Ring and Ether, but they aren't
publicy known about. It would be good if we had files for all the
wires which random people hang new things on somewhere. Any ideas?

Subject: Impending host table format change

I am in the final stages of debugging the various filters, etc to
implement the compartmentalization of the MIT host tables.  For those
who aren't in on this already, HSTMIT is being split up into several
smaller files that map one to one with Internet domains (AI.MIT.EDU,
LCS.MIT.EDU, ATHENA.MIT.EDU, etc).  The new host tables are actually
complete right now, and reside in MC: SYSNET;.  Don't anybody try to
use them yet though (you would have to work very hard to do so
anyway).  There is even a little documentation for them as wants it,
in MC: SYSNET; HSTNEW README.  I'll be testing this for a little while
on XX before mucking with the MC binaries, but that will happen fairly
soon (within two weeks) if nothing major goes wrong.

Anyone who uses the MC host tables at all is hereby warned that
something is almost certain to break on your machine when this change
goes into effect.  The most probably cause is the sheer size of the
new table.  The complete HOSTS3 table (HSTNIC + all the things that
used to be in HSTMIT) will be significantly bigger (how much depends
on what measure you use; the big change is a lot more nicknames for
MIT hosts, some fairly long).  A lot of this is temporary; far too
many existing programs have assumptions about primary hostnames
hardwired into them, so this part of the changeover has to be done in
stages.  Obviously there are a lot of tradeoffs here; questions or
suggestions on this should go to NAMECALLERS@MC rather than all of
INFO-HOSTS.

For now, anybody who edits MC: SYSNET; HSTMIT > should also edit the
appropriate subdomain file.  If you aren't sure what to do, just make
sure to tell me what changes you made and I'll update the appropriate
file.

I will send another message to INFO-HOSTS when I start the actual
changeover on MC, but I wanted to make sure that people had some
advance warning about this.

the primary hostname in HSTNIC (if the machine is in HSTNIC at all, of
course).  If you break this rule you will also break the HOSTS3

Alcator is a Vax at Alcator; it runs VMS.  The last time I heard of someone
using it was a couple of years ago.  PFC-VAX is another VMS VAX; it's at the
Plasma Fusion Center.  PFC-Versatec is presumably a MINITS 11 running DCP's
Versatec code at Plasma Fusion Center.  Cougar is the wrist controller for
the Puma robot arm; like Puma, it's an 11 running MINITS.  It's in 905
(Robotics Group, of course).  Golem is a 750 running VMS; it controls Ken
Salisbury's tendon hand; it's in the Lisp Machine corral.  Robotics Group

Thanks to everybody who responded.  I now have all the machines pegged
except for ARMSTRONG and SARAH, and all that really matters in this
case is knowing that they don't belong to LCS, AI, Athena, EECS, or
Speech (of course, if somebody *does* know about these two I'd like to

Based on the old one in syseng; the host2 table you generated had one small

should be

	NET CHAOS,  7

Other than that, it went down smoothly. Although my host table parser
also deals with the so-called host3 format, I would like to switch over 
to a domain system in the near future. What references are there on how
one should, and how others have already, implemented domain naming?

As I said, I don't think backing out of the binary was the right thing,
since only the QMAIL program uses that information, it's usually wrong,
and all it does is warn you that the site doesn't claim to support mail.
In fact, the system will send mail to sites which don't claim to support
the service. Since the information has not been used by anyone, I don't
think there has been a great effort to keep it correct.  Backing up to
an older binary means that some valid hosts will be compeltely unknown,
and mail to hosts which have moved will be permanently lost.  Moreover,
QMAIL is an ITS-only program (and hence an ITS bug) but the binary table
is used by some other sites (such as OZ.)

Anyway, I just went in and added the service lists to the dozen or so
sites which I think support mail but which didn't claim to, and created
a new binary table.

I stuck the subnet stuff back into the HSTMIT host table source file
where it has always been; it was an oversight that I forgot to include
it in that one version.

	The switch to the new host tables introduced a slight
problem in that CHAOS only hosts are now using an RFC810 format
instead of the old HOSTS format; the new format allows services
to be listed, and the old one did not. So, all CHAOS only hosts
are now listed without any services! This is causing some programs
(e.g. :MAIL) to complain. We have temporarily backed out of the
binary (*not* the source) of the new tables; someone will have
to go in and edit all the right services onto OZ, PYG, etc.

HSTMIT contains both Internet and Chaosnet hosts in extended RFC810 format.
Anyone needing a table in HOSTS2 format can contact me about a Common-lisp
hack I wrote to produce such things.

The host tables have been slightly rearranged as follows.

SYSNET;HSTNIC - The official Internet host table from the NIC.
		This is retrieved automatically from SRI-NIC each
		evening. No one ever edits this file.
		Hackers note: this file contains domain-style names
		such as "MIT-MC.ARPA" and "PURDUE.EDU", which is
		what everyone is (supposed to be) using now.
		--- This is in RFC810 format (of course.)

SYSNET;HSTMIC - Hosts which are ONLY on the Chaosnet and no other
		networks. This file does NOT include Chaosnet hosts
		which are also on the Internet.
		--- HSTMIC is currently in HOSTS2 format, although it will
		    probably be converted to modified RFC810* soon.

SYSNET;HSTMIB - Hosts which are on both the Internet and the Chaosnet.
		The hosts in here are basically copies of certain HSTNIC
		entries, but with Chaosnet addresses added.
		Note that sites which are Chaosnet-only need HSTMIB also!
		--- HSTMIB is in modified RFC810* format.

SYSNET;HSTMII - Hosts which are only on the Internet but which the NIC
		does not know about.  Since there probably shouldn't be
		any such hosts, this file may disappear in the future.
		The dozen hosts currently listed in here are being contacted
		to see what they think is going on with their host names.
		--- HSTMII is in HOSTS2 format.

* (Modified RFC810 format means that the address field may contain
   keyword network specs.  Example: "HOST : CHAOS 1440 : MIT-MC ...".
   The HOSTS3 compiler understands this format.)

The file SYSNET;HSTMIT is now obsolete and outdated.  Host additions
and changes should be made in the HSTMIC and HSTMIB files instead.
The new files are up to date (from HSTMIT 405 written this evening).

When you edit one of the files, be sure to send a note to everybody at
INFO-HOSTS describing your change.  Do not try to compile the files
for MC; this will be done periodically by an ITS hacker.

Cheers,
Chris

These machines are 3600's in E15, the new Media Lab.  The building
connects to the campus spine, thus is Internet.  There are a couple
Chaos hosts in the building which can (and occasionally do)
communicate, but there is no Chaos connection to the outside world.

It may be in the future that the MINITS bridge ARCMAC-HUB will get
reconstituted in order to connect the ARCMAC Magic-6 hosts to
the real world again.  If so, it might be necessary to boot it from
MIT-EMS, which is also in the building, and if so, MIT-EMS might
then assume MIT-MC's chaos address -- it's easier than cutting a
new rom for ARCMAC-HUB.  For this and other reasons, we chose not
to publicise chaos hackery within E15.  No one outside should ever
see any of it.

Disregarding my previous warnings that MC uses a special host table,
someone on 6/16 installed a bogus host table which broke the mail
system.  (I believe the exact breakage was that the host table forgot
all about any hosts which are on both the Internet and the Chaosnet,
including MIT-MC.)  I have de-installed the broken table, and mail is
flowing again.  I resubmitted about 40 incorrectly failed messages
which the mail system had retained copies of, but an indetermintent
number of messags were mis-delivered or completely lost. I have
removed the command file used to create new host tables.

This means if you make any changes, compile and install them, they
will not take effect on MC.  Assuming everything works, at the end of
the week the experimental stuff on MC will become the normal stuff.
The procedure for hacking the host tables will be a little different
at that time.

(Also, I am working on getting a domain name resolver/server going on
MC, and when that's up things will change yet again. Stay tuned!)

For those machines that still need HOSTS2 format files, you can get up
to date versions from SYSTEM:HOSTS2.TXT and SYSTEM:HOSTS2.BIN (source
and binary, respectively) by FTPing to XX and logging in as ANONYMOUS
with any password.  These files get generated automaticly by a batch
job from our HOSTS3 table.  Any host that doesn't fit into the HOSTS2
format is omitted, but otherwise this contains all the hosts and nets
in HSTMIT, HSTSYM, HSTSYI, and HSTNIC.

Right now these are in the old format, with no ".ARPA" on the ends of
Internet hostnames.  When the MC source files change format, so will
these.

Since I no longer need to hand-edit our version of the NIC host

installed a system demon which will run on MC each day to keep our

So, if you compile the host tables here, be aware that the NIC table
will be updated without human intervention and inspection.  If the NIC
table is broken or something (bad versions have been known to be
released in the past) you may encounter errors.  You should report
these things to me, and I'll fix them (of course if if you are plenty
damn sure you know what's going on you can fix it yourself.)

Subject:  Host table formats changing soon!
To: INFO-HOSTS @ MIT-MC


In the near future, the format of the HSTNIC and HSTMIT host table
files will be changing as part of the transition to the Internet name
domain system.

The HSTNIC file will reflect the official Internet host table at the
NIC, which these days has hosts with domain names like "MIT-AI.ARPA".  
The hosts also have nicknames like "MIT-AI" (their pre-domain official
global name).

The HSTMIT file will become a HOSTS3 (extended RFC810) format file,
Internet hosts listed in this file will be renamed to correspond to
their names in the HSTNIC file (ie., they will have ".ARPA" tacked on
to them.

Note: Collisions between nicknames in the HSTNIC and HSTMIT file
(e.g., MIT's EDDIE vs. UW's EDDIE) will probably not be solved by
these changes, since their is no real domain name system underneath.

If you are using the HOSTS3 compiler, you can at least compile the new
files.  You may have some trouble with software which thinks it knows
about name domains.  Of course, eventually a great deal of the world
will have to be rewritten to use the name domain stuff in a fully
general way, but that headache is still a little while off.

Also, does anyone still use the old "HOSTS >" format file?  
You probably shouldn't be.  The data in there is far from 
complete or accurate.  Also, since HSTMIT will be in a different
format from HOSTS, updating HOSTS will be painful and people will
probably stop doing it very much (if they are now.)

Please direct any questions and problems to me.

  I got the following error:
  
      Duplicate address 18.20.41.21 = MIT-YOSEMITE-SAM, SCRC-RIVERSIDE
  	.....
      180 nets, 1497 sites, 3174 names; length 21180
      1 "serious" errors, so not writing binary file.
  
  Here are the NIC host table entries for the hosts in question:
  
  HOST : 18.20.41.21, 192.10.41.21 : SCRC-RIVERSIDE : ....
  
  HOST : 18.20.27.21, 18.27.0.21 : MIT-YOSEMITE-SAM,SAM ....
  
  Now, I always thought the 3rd digit in the net 18 scheme was always 0
  for some reason.  In any case, I think HOSTS3 also believes this as it
  seems to be ignoring it.
  
  Since I am not sure who is out of step here, I am sending to all the
  probable parties, in hopes someone will know the right fix.
  
The arpa numeric address standard calls for decimal numbers separated
by dots.  My understanding is that the numbers 18.20.subnet.host are
used at mit to signify those host addresses which support chaos wrapped
internet packets and can unwrap them.  For those hosts, "subnet"
corresponds to the chaos subnet number and "host" to the chaos host
number.  I directly translated chaos octal subnet 033 to decimal number
27. in order to arrive at the addresses for bugs-bunny (18.20.27.17)
and yosemite-sam (18.20.27.21).  Both hosts also have raw internet
packet addresses (18.27.0.17, 18.27.0.21).

The HOSTS3 program must treat the first two numbers of addresses of the
form 18.x as determining the subnet and the last two as determining the
host.  This will work for both addresses of the form 18.x.0.y and
18.20.x.y.

In fact, I think it was an error for me to send the 18.20.27.y addresses
to sri-nic as they do not need to know them.  Those addresses are only
significant for the wrapping gateways around mit.

P.S.
Please send mail to me direct as I am not on any of the hosts mailing lists.

	The problem here is that with the 'new' CHAOS wrapping scheme
in use the third byte is in fact in use. HOSTS3 is incorrect in ignoring
this. Yosemite and Riverside have addresses that are identical except
in the third byte.
	The number of hosts that have that byte non-zero should be very
small; they are the wrapping/unwrapping gateways. The only ones I know
of that are actually running are Bugs, Gross, Riverside and Trillian.
You could probably deleete the offending address for Sam without much
problem.

The latest host table (including HSTNIC #384) is compiled and installed.
The HOSTS3 compiler is "fixed".

HOSTS3 hackers: The compiler does not do the sort of dynamic memory
allocation I had assumed. I was therefore able to make some more room in
the ITS version simply by moving where in core the table was being
constructed.  I didn't calculate how much room is left over for new code
or tables, but the increase should hold us for a while.  Of course, we
are racing against the rate of host additions on the various networks in
our table (the Internet, the Chaosnet, etc.)  Hopefully by the time we
run out it will be time to implement a hairy namespace system.  
Won't that be fun!

I installed the latest NIC table, and discovered a new name conflict:
someone else has a SYLVESTER, so I manually removed their nickname.

People should be careful to remember that hosts whose entries appear
in multiple tables must match.  I found several offending entries with
conflicting ARPAnet addresses between the HSTMIT and HSTNIC table,
conflicting host nicknames, and different machine types.  If the
HOSTS3 compiler gets confused and thinks that different machines with
the same name are being talked about in different files, it will throw
away some or all of the information for those hosts.

Mistakes (which I have corrected) in the HSTMIT table had 
removed PREP and TINMAN from the Chaosnet!

Also added SANCHO-PANZA (a 3d floor 3600) to the Chaosnet.

Subject: New host tables


Well, being rather bored, I decided to teach myself to get new host
tables from the NIC and compile host tables on MC.

I did the following things.  I think they are right, but would
appreciate any suggestions for a better way:

   - Ran CSTACY;HOSTS to retrieve the lastest NIC table

   - Did :XFILE SYSENG;HOSTS XFILE to create the tables

   - Got the following cruft printed out:

Nickname WARD for Internet site WASHINGTON is also a CHAOS host, ignored.
Nickname ROCKY for Internet site CU-ROBOTICS is also a CHAOS host, ignored.
Nickname MERLIN for Internet site PURDUE-MERLIN is also a CHAOS host, ignored.
Nickname LARRY for Internet site UW-BLUECHIP is also a CHAOS host, ignored.
Nickname FORD for Internet site FORD1 is also a CHAOS host, ignored.
Nickname EDDIE for Internet site UW-EDDIE is also a CHAOS host, ignored.
Nickname COYOTE for Internet site SU-COYOTE is also a CHAOS host, ignored.
Nickname ARTHUR for Internet site PURDUE is also a CHAOS host, ignored.

    - Went back in, and hand edited out the DUPS from the NIC table,
      and wrote back out the table to the same version (349).

    - Compiled the table again, noticing that the NIC had now made
      MIT-NEWTOWNE-VARIETY the primary name for MIT-FLA.  Of course
      HSTMIT still had MIT-FLA as the primary name, so HOSTS2 bitched.

    - Edited HSTMIT to make it consistent with HSTNIC.

    - Compiled the tables one last time.

I wasn't sure if ALL the dup nicknames usually got edited out, but it
seemed like the right thing for local use.

Anyway, if I did something wrong, someone can fix it, and please let
me know so I don't do it again.

In order to make HOSTS3 happy, I had to set the official name of

If the NIC table ever gets the new apparent official name for FLA,
then it will be ok to change the MIT tables.

[MC:SYSENG;HOSTS 737] lacks the most recent updates appearing in

In-reply-to: Msg of 28 Mar 1984  16:47-EST from Gail Zacharias <GZ at MIT-OZ>

There are a few easy ways out of this mess (some easier than
others).

1.  Somebody add mit-athena, and athena, as nicknames for charon,
unless there's some special reason why that shouldn't be done.

2.  Steve, if you were using MM, and did 

to: "mit-athena!tony"@mit-eddie,

I believe MM would have converted it properly for MMAILR to use it.
(Is that so, Gail?  If not, we have a serious problem here.)  If you
didn't, you don't have to put quotes around the foreign address,
because the quotes are there so MM won't interpret the ! as a comment.
(Correct me again Gail if I'm wrong.)

3. In general, you should try to find other means besides using UUCP
to send mail which you want delivered in a hurry.  (It looked from the
message as if you expected it to get there immediately.)  UUCP mail is
more than a magnitude of order slower than CHAOS mail, which means
that it probably would have taken a day or so for your message to get
to mit-athena (if it ever got there -- you'd be surprised at how often
UUCP mail gets lost).  I don't see any reason why they are not
accepting chaos mail anyhow, seeing as they're on the chaosnet, that
sort of goes along with the territory.

	ftp.  Really, it's user-interface brain death.  You see it used

	that the default used to be adequate for any file transfer, and who

    Someone changed the machine type in the host table of all the pdp10s from
    "PDP10" to imaginative things like "DEC-10", "DEC-1080".  Thus FTP can no
    longer tell when a machine is a pdp10.  Probably this was imposed on us by
    the NIC.  Someone should give FTP a list of all the known pdp10 machines or
    all the known pdp10 operating systems, replacing the present code in the
    NHOSTN routine.

    Presumably this is an attempt to get us all to switch to Unix.

I just changed FTP to think that things which run ITS, WAITS, TOPS10,
TOPS20, TENEX, and FOONEX are PDP-10s.

Subject:  Project Athena Vaxen & Large Chaos subnet numbers
To: INFO-HOSTS @ MIT-MC

Two Project Athena Vaxen have been added to HSTMIT table as Chaos only
hosts.

They are MIT-CHARON, Chaos address 042015 and MIT-APOLLO, Chaos address
042013.  APOLLO is not actually on the chaos net yet, but probably will
be in time, along with another dozen or two Project Athena machines.

Some of you may have noticed that these machines are on Chaos subnet
104o.  This subnet is 11d higher than any previously active subnet on the
MIT-Chaos net.  This is due to various places which have reserved subnets
not yet operational or connected to the main MIT Chaos net.

This subnet is not reachable by a large number of Chaosnet hosts due to
their routing tables being too small.  I have fixed the bridges
MIT-INFINITE and MIT-BYPASS, which merely needed recompiling.  However,
there are other bridges and hosts that should have their routing tables
enlarged.  In partcular the front end 11 for every 20 on campus, MIT-VAX
and I imagine many other Unix hosts.

Note that Chaos subnet 104o=68d, whereas the Athena machines all think
they are on Internet subnet 18.58.xx.xx.  I understand that there was once
an attempt to maintain a correspondence between MIT internet subnet and
Chaos subnet numbers.  Apparently Project Athena was originally assigned a
set of subnets starting at 58d, but when these were claimed by groups, no
one bothered informing the Athena staff.  This doesn't represent any
problem yet, if it ever will, as there is no Internet link from the Athena
machines to the rest of the Internet.

I would also make a plea that if people increase their routing table sizes
they go straight to 122d (172o).  This is the number of subnet entries
that will fit in the maximum size routing packet.  It's real hard to
figure out that no one can talk to your subnet because your routing
packets are being ignored.

	    The NIC seems to be putting CPU types of "SYMBOLICS-3600"
	    on things, while our local tables say "3600".  This makes
	    the HOSTS3 compiler print silly warnings, so I edited the
	    HSTNIC file to use the "3600" convention.  Someone should
	    decide which they would rather see, and get everyone to use it.

	SYMBOLICS-3600 is the way SCRC wanted their hosts listed.  I guess
	that is the new convention...

When I first had SCRC-Peace added to the NIC host table, I told them
that it was a Symbolics 3600.  They assigned the machine type
"SYMBOLICS-3600" to it.  I followed their lead from then on.

HOSTS 724 and HSTMIT 170 add Chaos sites MIT-EMS (6401), MIT-HAYDN (6402),
and MIT-WAIF (6420). Additionally, MIT-INFINITE (bldg 8 bridge) has grown
a new address 6410.

Subnet vultures will note that this constitutes the (re)activation of
subnet 15 as part of the Big Picture.

    ftp.  Really, it's user-interface brain death.  You see it used
    to do-the-right-thing between pdp10s and now it doesn't.  We expected
    without thinking that it would.  (I think that was it anyway;  transfering
    in ascii rather than 36bit).  It's not like it lies or anythign, but
    that the default used to be adequate for any file transfer, and who
    really looks at spastic program printout anyway....
Someone changed the machine type in the host table of all the pdp10s from
"PDP10" to imaginative things like "DEC-10", "DEC-1080".  Thus FTP can no
longer tell when a machine is a pdp10.  Probably this was imposed on us by
the NIC.  Someone should give FTP a list of all the known pdp10 machines or
all the known pdp10 operating systems, replacing the present code in the
NHOSTN routine.

Presumably this is an attempt to get us all to switch to Unix.

HOSTS 723 and HSTMIT 169 add MIT-MATH-HUB at chaos 7740 (SN17, 340),
a MINITS box out at the end of Bldg 2.

It appears there is life out there after all.

Well, addition. I added mit-pluto, another ibm pc. I also changed the
host type for mit-borax from vax to vax-11/750 so that lisp machines

I and Sylvester wish to invite all to share in a quick dance of hosannas

after I sent my note that it was not all that coherent as to what
it was requesting; I am most impressed at how much you have managed

the spelling of PUDDYTAT, and would ask to include this one as

    Could I petition for the nickname "PFC" to be changed to apply to
    MIT-PFC-VAX (a server) and not MIT-FUSION (a terminal concentrator).

I removed the "PFC" and "PFC-11" nicknames from the PLASMA concentrator,
in the source.  Will take effect next time there is a significant update.
