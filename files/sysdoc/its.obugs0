    It's cheating.  Terminal-0-F  @Rutgers, c-Break, chaos:conn-list
    shows that the contact name the LispM is using is NAME @rutgers.

Aha.  Except that SYSTEM-T RUTGERS connects to MC and then gets
me to RUTGERS ok.  It also works for SCORE.

I figured it out.  You aren't following the protocol of the TCP
NAME server.  Connecting isn't enough.  After you connect, you
must then give the JCL.  Try :chtn mcTCP rutgers 117 (the caps
are important).  When it opens the connection, type return.

    If I go to a LispM and finger RUTGERS, it connects to MC and I
    get a Finger listing from RUTGERS.  I can also TELNET from a
    LispM to SCORE.  So, I think the ARPA server works.

The ARPA server still doesn't work.  If I go to MC and do F @RUTGERS
then I get a Rutgers Finger display.  If, from OZ, I connect to the
ARPA server with "RUTGERS 117" then I never get the stuff.  What it
was doing a few seconds ago was just hanging... I waited a minute or
so (on several occasions) but never got any response.  Usually there's
a "Failed to TCP connect" message, and sometimes a "Timed-out" and
other similar things, but it has never once worked.

In-reply-to: The message of 27 Apr 83 05:24-EDT from Alan Bawden <ALAN at MIT-MC>

I have an idea for implementing Twenex-like logical names on ITS.
The main feature which I want from logical names is search paths,
so that COM: and SYS: and others could be made to do the right thing.

The jobdev mechanism could be used as-is for this feature, but I dont
want the overhead of a jobdev and the slowness of doing the IOTs
multiple times.  

My idea for getting around this is a to extend JOBRET so that there is
a way for the BDH to tell the system: "I am going away now. Disconnect
the user from me and retry the OPEN call using these args I am giving
you."  Once this kind of JOBRET is done, the BDH's BOJ: channel is
closed and he should logout or reuse.  There will probably want to be
some restrictions (like maybe: the BDH must not have .IOTed anything
yet) based on internal implementation details.

With this feature, a user could open the FOO: device, which would
start a BDH.  The BDH would do a JOBCAL and find out the OPEN
parameters.  Then the BDH does its thing to figure out where the user
really wants to be OPEN to, and does a JOBRET to pass control back to
ITS for retrying the OPEN call. 

I am willing to implement this in ITS, and maybe put some kind of
interface on it for users (so they dont have to write their own BDH's
whenever they want to make a logical name).

Thoughts?

As I recall, you threatened to do this for the sake of things
like HS: as well.  Anyway, one possibility is to have users
translate FOO:*;* * to LOGICL:*;* *.  The LOGICL device could
open DSK:hsname;xuname LOGICL to find an ascii file containing
lines of LOGICAL-DEVICE &REST PATHS, where PATHS can contain *s
for when to default to the field from the open call.  You would
have to be careful to make sure loops don't happen (e.g., foo: ->
bar: -> foo: ...).  Perhaps you can use LINK-DEPTH-EXCEEDED...
To appease people like me who already have 6 translations, you
may have to up the translation table size if you decide to use
this method.

    Why doesn't SYS: look in the overflow directories SYS1; SYS2; SYS3;
    prray tell?

I thought about this some more, and I talked it over with Moon, and it
appears that the answer is:  For no good reason.

There are some red herring issues like:  What should happen if you try to
read the binary directory listing from SYS:.FILE. (DIR)?  And:  What
exactly should happen if you open SYS:FOO > for writing?  But it appears
that a perfectly good answer to most of those objections is:  Well what
makes you think that the SYS: device should behave at all like the DSK:
device anyway?  (Why should it have a binary directory, and why should you
be able to write to it.)

There would be the compatibility problem with current programs that use
SYS: as a synonym for DSK:SYS;, but they could all be trivially fixed.
Think of al the places that implement the SYS;, SYS1;, ... search
themselves currently...

(Now, can somebody think of something clever for the COM: device to do?)

Looking at this crash with PEEK's autopsy mode reveals that sure
enough the system was out of low memory, because there were tons
of disk channels open.

What is interesting is that one TEX job had 9 disk channels open, 7
of them to the same file!  There was another TEX running too, tho not
as hoggish.  And there were several ATSIGN CHAOS jobs scattered
around; these invariably seem to litter up the system whenever it
gets wedged (cause or effect?)

and it looked like it was just halted in its tracks.  In particular,
I dont see the PC or anything printed anywhere.

The messages it was printing were to tell you that the load on the
system was too high (in the sense that there were no disk channels).
That is why the system no doubt looked wedged to users.

Btw, I fixed ITS so that it will only print those warning messages
every thirty seconds, so it wil not overflow the console buffer
(which is what the SYS MSGS LOST means.   Maybe it should say
SYS MSGS LOTS instead...)

Now ITS only does running out of resource checks if it has not done
one in the last thirty seconds.  This is to avoid deluging the system

There are two different, incompatible file systems on CADR-27.  
If you want to use what I believe is called the "FS" filesystem, you
need to use CFTP.  If you use the "FC" filesystem (written by RMS) you
can use either CFTP or just the FC: device.

I just typed :LISTF FC:CSTACY; on MC, and it listed my directory for me. 
What do you think is wrong?

    The check for running out of low core I put in goes off quite alot,
    and frequently overflows the system console message buffer. Usually
    when this goes off, it means that the system appears wedged to users.
    Do you suppose there could be a bug in the system with someone not
    returning some flavor of buffer space at the right time?

More likely there is just isn't enough address space for all the disk
buffers, disk directories, chaos buffers, tcp buffers, core link buffers,
and everything else.  Isn't it the case that if you wait a while and
kill all jobs with open files the space always comes back eventually?

This is because translating *:ARCH;* * => AR1:INNA;* * will cause

COMSAT now uses MC as the "bug host".  I changed all the appropriate
mailing lists, and installed the latest COMSAT on all four machines.
I put the following in the MC:NAMES > file:

;;; MC is now the default BUG host.  
;;; If a program exists on all machines, its BUG list normally
;;; only needs to be on MC.
;;;
;;; The reasons to define a BUG- name on some ITS besides MC include:
;;; o  The program is not used on MC.
;;; o  The program is mainly used on the other ITS, and most of 
;;;        the maintainers are there, and there is an entry 
;;;        on MC which forwards to the apporpriate machine.
;;; o  In the absence of such reasons, define it on MC only.
;;;
;;; If a message is sent from some other ITS to a bug list which is not
;;; defined, it will be forwarded here.  If the bug list is not defined
;;; here, the message will be sent instead to BUG-RANDOM-PROGRAM.

Message-ID: <1983.4.15.2.10.27.Hank.Walker@CMU-CS-VLSI>

It is probably not the UNIX mailer that is causing the problems.  Mail
messages from MIT go to CMU-CS-A.  If it is TCP mail, it is shipped
to the CMU-CS-PT VAX over the Ethernet, which translates the stuff into
NCP, and sends it back to CMUA where it is delivered to me.  That mail is
then autoforwarded to me at CMU-CS-VLSI, where I live, even though INFO-COBOL
has my CMU-CS-A mailing address.  So the mail is delivered directly 
to CMU-CS-A, which is a KL10 running TOPS-10, rather than to a UNIX machine.
I have no troubles receiving mail from any other site on the net to either
CMU-CS-VLSI directly or to CMU-CS-VLSI, which communicates with the ARPAnet
over an Ethernet gateway.

Forwarding complaint about the MC mailer.  Following are some
parts of the MC mail stats file.  Other ditties of information:
Other messages to CMU-CS-A get through successfully.  The ones I
saw happened to be small messages.  Could this be the Unix
braindeath that insists on completely delivering messages
(instead of queuing) before it gives a completion reply?  If so,
the product of number of recipients by the length of the message
is a roungh indication of the length of time it will take to
deliver the message.  If things are sufficiently slow, MC will
correctly timeout.  If this is true, I would have to say it is
the Unix mail server that is broken.

The last ML ITS was assembled in middle of March, plenty of time for your
NSUBNT change to take effect.  I checked it out just now, and found
that you modified the CHAOS source on SYSTEM; rather than SYSHAK; which
is where all of the recent TCP/IP work has been happening.  So I just
now bumped up NSUBNT to 100. in the SYSHAK version (the only change you
made) and someone will have to assemble a new ML ITS sometime.

I guess now that things are obviously working, SYSHAK should be merged back
into SYSTEM, so I will do that eventually.

And you, Mr. Conner, have as much to learn as I.

Reactionary is not bullshit.  Go read a history book someday and
notice how progress is often achieved by reactionaries and their
ideas.

As for the local history of OZ, there were several people willing
(and eager) to help in creating another ITS.  Moon was willing to
hack microcode and oversee changes needed to the system (e.g.,
for disk support) which I was willing to help with.  As I recall,
you were against the idea of ITS on OZ.  Several other people
attended the Wars of Futility where it was decided to run 20X.
These people warned about all the features that 20X was lacking
and many of the problems it had.  But the wars were futile; the
decision was out of our hands.

So now our only recourse is to sit back and be little brats about
the whole thing.  "Nah, nah, I told you so..."  I, for one, am
proud to be one of these brats.

    For god's sake bring up a machine because it is the Right Thing, not
    because you hate another machine so much.
Wrong.  Both are often true.  In fact, this is how TWENEX was
developed. The history told to me was that BBN disliked Bots-10 so
much they went off and wrote TENEX.  DEC started seeing the light
and bought it from them and made it work on a 20.
						Learn from the mistakes of
    another attempt, ...
If TWENEX only could.

    Plummer, ... until you learn to work FOR A GOAL instead of
    AGAINST AN ALTERNATIVE you will be counterproductive to the
    causes you Support.  
Goal: Help build better Lisp Machines.  I think I am working for
this goal.  Goal: help MIT when I have the time.  I think I do a
fair job here.  Goal: convince people they lost completely when
they decided to run TWENEX on OZ.  Perhaps this is a subconsious
goal.  How actively I work toward it is not clear.  I would hope
to think I keep such discussions among (ITS) friends except when
something blatant happens.  If you didn't blindly defend the
obvious problems, OZ would probably be a lot nicer.

    Penny, I already know I will regret sending this, because so many
    minds are already closed, but I had to try.  Forgive me.
Mine is closed just enough so that spikes cannot penetrate.  I
know who does the real TWENEX development at MIT, and they have
often responded to the requests of others for (ITS-like)
features.  I hope they also understand the spirit in which I
write these flames.

Marty, you earned your second spike.

Dogma, Plain and simple will be the downfall of ITS.
It contains the ideas and talent to be great, but lacks the tolerance
of other ideas that will see it wither and die.

Most of what I have heard out of the ITS people is REACTIONARY
bullshit.  A system is just a system, and the thing I can't understand
is why people that could design such beauty and generality can't
quietly bide their time until they get the hardware and then create
another system to show the world what is meant by winning.
I would be proud to help bring up a new ITS, I would be proud to help
bring up another 20, but not in a reationary spirit.
But rather for the love of the hack.

For god's sake bring up a machine because it is the Right Thing, not
because you hate another machine so much.  Learn from the mistakes of
another attempt, but don't be driven by hate and arrogance.

Gosh, I wonder just how many people on the 6 mailing lists that KLH
shotgunned his msg to really give a ff about where the MIDAS sources
live.  Probably damn few.  Oz is the successor to AI.  Moving mailing
lists and sources of system programs to it from AI seems natural to me.
Since KLH got the msg Ian sent, he still is on the new offical list at
oz, so why gripe?  His talk of "sacrilege" conjures up images of the
inquisition.  Is KLH the defender of the ITS faith?  Probably KLH's main
gripe is that he hates TOPS-20 and is pissed at having to goto a TOPS-20
site to look at the sources.  If he uses it for TOPS-20 and 10X
software, why does he need it on ITS?

I hope the people in charge of the MIDAS mailing list and sources
do the appropriate thing in response to KLH's flame, ie. ignore it.

I just got a message at SRI-NIC which IAN sent to BUG-MIDAS at OZ.
This implies that OZ has a BUG-MIDAS mailing list, and furthermore
that this list is NOT the same as the official list on AI.

This reminds me of the BUG-ATSIGN lossage.

I consider myself one of those people who now and then maintain MIDAS.
For the list to be moved without notice is reprehensible.  For it to
not be on an ITS is sacrilege.  I must insist that either AI or MC
be the official home of MIDAS sources and mailing lists.  This
should probably apply to all ITS developed software.  Since I was the
person who did the TENEX/TOPS-20 conversion for MIDAS, and regularly
use it for 10X/20X software, you can hardly say my viewpoint is
wedged.

No, actually it was failing because the LSR1 file was smashed for

copying the old version back over.

    DDT's LSRMAP now has an error return.  All of it's callers seemed

Considering how many things break totally when the INQUIR data base is

Furthermore, INQUPD should try to make sure the existing file is OK before
it renames it to LSR1 OLD.

TTYFLS, with it's single control bit set to 0, simply sets %TXIGN in the

availability of input characters.  

Since EMACS won't redisplay if it thinks there are characters to be read,
this is one way to cause an EMACS to fail to redisplay when proceeded.  I
don't think this exact screw can explain the mysterious "CStacy's lossage".
Few programs probably use TTYFLS and even fewer with that control bit set
to 0.  But perhaps something else can cause .LISTEN to lie?  (Does the

New XITS (1329) installed on MC.  Old XITS renamed to ITS.  There is
no NITS.  This version has a subtle change in SALV; SALV now starts at
212000 instead of 200000, in order to make room for extra ITS code!
.;SALV 306BIN is the version that has this relocation hacked; SALV BIN
still points to the old version.  All future ITSes generated for MC must
use SALV 306 or higher.

This version of ITS tries to implement TCP URGENT handling for
direct-connected STYs.  I haven't tested it yet.  All the known
patches have also been incorporated; if I missed any we'll probably
know about it pretty soon.  The most important change is basically
the one to SALV, since the 200000 address has always been hard-wired
that way and there may conceivably be some ancient software that
is in for a rude shock.  There are no plans to change this for
the KA ITSes at the moment.

In-reply-to: The message of 8 Mar 1983 20:44 EST from David C. Plummer <DCP>

I was about to point out that there is already an error code for one
variety of malformed .CALL, %ENSCL (illegal system call name).  Except I
find that the following:

	.CALL [SETZ ? SIXBIT /FOOBAR/ ? %CLERR,,1 ? SETZ 2]

Fails to skip, yet also fails to load 1 with any error code (it does not
even clear it.)  The left half of .IOS 0 is loaded with %ENSCL however, so
is is possible to find out the error if you look hard enough.  I'll bet the
idea is that if the first two words in a call block don't clearly identify
it as such, then ITS has no business looking at the next word and using it
to trash some other random location in the user's address space.

Now that is all fine and good if the instruction following the .CALL is a
.LOSE, since DDT will be able to figure it all out, but if instead there
was a JRST to a error reporting routine, I'll bet total randomness would
result from using the garbage left in 1 as an error code.  I guess I have
never been so unlucky as to misspell the name of a system call in a .CALL
that I was planning on handling the errors from myself.  I would argue that
THIS case should be made an ILOPR as well!

Another kind of malformed call block, namely one that doesn't terminate
with a word with bit 4.9 on, generates %ETMRG (too many arguments).  Since
this error is NOT a function of which call was named in the call block, it
really can only be interpreted as meaning "malformed call block".  However
it seems that ITS thinks that such call blocks are well-formed enough to
actually risk storing the error code in any supplied error parameter.
Since convention is to write error parameters at the beginning of a call
block, I think this is reasonable.

Funny, when I started this message I was planning on agreeing with KLH, but
I seem to have convinced myself that DCP is right.

I think ILOPRing is the right thing.  One argument is to
enumerate the common system calls and observe the effect of
changing it.  My first impression is a change would cause subtle
bugs, especially during debugging (where I'd insist on ILOPR if I
programmed it incorrectly).  Another argument is philosophy:
non-SKIP means failure to perform the desired operation.  ILOPR
means failure to perform the desired instruction.  You can't have
an operation before you have an instruction.

Is it the right thing that .CALLs which point to a non-SETZ word
get an ILOPR instead of failing to skip?  Currently the only
thing which uses .CALL 0, is the symbolic system call frob, and
presumably if any new secondary dispatch is invented for it (ie
something other than SETZ as 1st word pointed at) it could also
be made the sort of call that skipped on success.

(this came up because a botched net server had a bad .CALL arg and
was ILOPR'ing instead of getting a failure return which would have
cleaned up the resulting mess)

    If MC goes down and comes back up, and I've patiently remained dialled
    up while it was down, it typically types out 30 or so "x" characters and
    then just stays wedged, probably waiting for 300 baud input as opposed to
    1200 baud which is what I normally use.  I guess optimal behavior would be
    for the 11 to remember the baud rate and tell the 10 when it comes back up,
    while suboptimal behavior would be to flush the 11's input buffer and then
    retry autospeeding.  Lousy behavior would be to hang up on the user.  But
    the current behavior is just about pessimal.
I don't know why it does this, since autospeeding and baud rates and all
of that are entirely inside the 11; the 10 has nothing to do with it.
But maybe someone gratuitously reloaded the 11, or maybe KLDCP did a Unibus
reset or something??  Also I'm pretty sure the baud rate is set to 1200
when the program is first loaded, before autospeeding.  I remember that
a couple of years ago I tried to debug this and couldn't.

TELSER apparently has a bug putting the host address where PWORD can
see it, (or maybe PWORD needs to see a different format host address).

MC was down this morning when I came in. Someone cold booted it and it only
lasted a few minutes. He was in the midst of cold booting it when I came in
to look at it just now, so I finished the booting. Next time it crashes, I'll
try to poke a bit at the state and provide some debugging info. I posted
a system message (in SYS;SYSTEM MAIL) warning that the system was being 
unreliable. If it stays up for a while, someone might want to remove that 
message. --kmp

MC would not boot from disk this afternoon, because it was hung, probably
at PI level 3, shlunking unit 1 back and forth.  Apparently booting
with the boot switch is incapable of stopping the processor???  Eventually,
by turning off unit 1, I got the machine to crash, and it then booted.  This
seems less than elegant as a way of solving the problem.

To: BUG-ITS @ MIT-MC, BUG-TELNET @ MIT-MC, BUG-PEEK @ MIT-MC,
    BUG-NETWRK @ MIT-MC, BUG-MAIL @ MIT-MC, BUG-FTP @ MIT-MC

I decided to do a little work on credit tonight.

SYSENG;HOSTS XFILE now generates SYSBIN;HOSTS3 BIN as well.  This is the
	new Internet host table and it is intended to become the standard.
	Both HOSTS1 and HOSTS2 will eventually go away.
SYSENG;NETWRK has a new switch, $$HSTS3, that tells the routines to use
	HOSTS3 instead of HOSTS2.  Also, the host number parser has
	been taught how to understand the new 4-octet syntax, as
	in "10.3.0.44" which is MC.
TELNET has been modified to use the NETWRK routines (HOSTNM and
	SYMGET and friends).  As a result, TELNET uses HOSTS3 and
	no longer needs HOSTS1.  Hurray!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	This of course implies that TELNET parses anything NETWRK does.
	The big question: is there ANY other software that still depends
	on HOSTS1??  I am going to flush that table VERY soon.
HOST (alias HSTLOK) has likewise been modified for HOSTS3.
TELSER also uses HOSTS3.
PEEK now uses HOSTS3.
COMSAT now uses ...
QMAIL now ...
FTPS now ...
FTPU ...		(All on MC only for the moment)

Not a bad night's work.  Ka-ching!

There are still a number of programs that need to have $$HST3 turned
on.  The only thing you need to be careful of is references to NW$BYT
and NW%ARP or NW%CHS; it is better to use the GETNET macro than
NW$BYT.  The file format itself is almost the same; only the format
of host and net addresses is different.  Note that ITS will understand
either HOSTS2 or HOSTS3 format, using either NCP or TCP, so there is
no need to retain HOSTS2 even if you are keeping NCP code around for
posterity (which I recommend, by the way).
	As you upgrade, try to add a note to NETWRK pointing at your
software, (see the first page) so that eventually we will have a handy
list of things that use NETWRK and which will need to be reviewed in
the event of future changes.

I have installed another new PEEK on MC for testing.
One feature of this version is that it does away with the stupid
internal table that gave certain people (who are CC'd above) J mode
by default.  Those people who cannot type :P J can just type :PJ
or PJ^K, if they establish the necessary link to SYS;TS PEEK.

A more interesting feature is the ability to PEEK at ITS crash dumps.
This must be invoked as JCL, to wit ":PEEK < filename".  For example,
	:P <CRASH;ITS BLOWN
This will grovel for a while and then put you into an "autopsy mode"
(command char is "<") which doesn't have much useful info at the
moment, but most of the other modes will then show you what ITS
was doing at the moment it crashed.  Rather entertaining...

A feature of interest only to PEEK hackers is that the code has
undergone a lot of facelifting.

Let's see if I can remember everything I just did.

For MC:

I linked DEVICE;JOBDEV AI to the same thing DEVICE;JOBDEV DM
points to (SYSBIN;MLDEV BIN).  This caused AI to appear as a
device.  ML's and DM's DEVICE directories are consistent (and
hopefully have the correct programs).

For AI:

I installed the TCP NAME user/server program.  :F @AI from MC now
works.  :F @MC from AI does not because AI tries to use the
chaosnet!!??!!.  The host table on AI says it is arpanet only,
but apparently the system still has chaos code assembled in.  
:F @DM from AI does work.

I tried to make sure the user ITS JOBDEVs were correct.  MC:...
doesn't work, again because it tries to use the chaosnet.  DM:
does work though.

CSTACY, you should revise AI's greeting message (about MLSLV
services), clean up any mess I may have left around, and perhaps
assemble AI without chaosnet code (if that is the right thing).

Subject: Autospeed dialups and system crashes
To: BUG-ITS @ MIT-MC

If MC goes down and comes back up, and I've patiently remained dialled
up while it was down, it typically types out 30 or so "x" characters and
then just stays wedged, probably waiting for 300 baud input as opposed to
1200 baud which is what I normally use.  I guess optimal behavior would be
for the 11 to remember the baud rate and tell the 10 when it comes back up,
while suboptimal behavior would be to flush the 11's input buffer and then
retry autospeeding.  Lousy behavior would be to hang up on the user.  But
the current behavior is just about pessimal.
Obviously this is low-priority, though if somebody was to volunteer to fix
the symptom by simply having MC never go down I'm sure they'd get a penny
from JM.  I'd be willing to give them a quarter, myself!

I made the ITS name user and name server work under TCP.  I made
some spazzes, and there was a NCP/TCP difference causing a little
more lossage.

Spazz 1: I completely blew it when doing the NETBLK for the LSN.
  I gave it %NSRFS as the wait state.  A lot of good that does!!
Spazz 2: I didn't know that a NETBLK for the LSN would probably
  return the new state as %NSRFC.  There is another NETBLK
  waiting for it to go out of %NSRFC.
Spazz 3: The /i switch (use IP/TCP) simply could not work.  There
  is a comment to this effect in the code.  Basically, :f /i@dm
  passes the /i on to DM, and :f @dm/i throws the /i away (this
  is conjecture, but seems to fit the data).  Therefore, it
  always uses TCP over the arpanet.

Difference: NCP didn't need a FORCE done to send the JCL to the
  other host?  I know TCP does, but there was now such call in
  the program.  There is now!

I installed and pdumped this on MC, ML and DM (what's going on
with AI?).  I tested it between MC and DM (both directions) and
ML and DM (both directions).  Source is back in SYSEN2; (whence it
came).

Ken, I know several people complained that ITS thought it had a
TCP NAME server but it never worked.  Could you ask them to try
again?  Thanks.

Contact name NCP  tries to establish an NCP connection, even

Contact name ARPA tries to establish a  TCP connection.  If it

     Recently there has been a change in the way that the user is notified
     that a proceeded Macsyma needs the tty.
     Formerly, notification would be issued only once while in another Macsyma,
     but it now appears that this occurs whenever a file is loaded.  To see
     this new behavior, start up a Macsyma, then after you get a (C1)
     ^Z it and ^P it.
     Then start a second Macsyma, and try something like
     INTEGRATE(X,X,0,1);
     I have not tried OA^K.
     I prefer the old behavior.
  This printout is done by ITS, not by MACSYMA, so we have no control 
  over it.  It happens whenever the job needs to go up to top-level for 
  something which may very well happen while a file is being loaded. 
  I'm not convinced there's been any change here, but if there has, it's 
  an ITS issue, not a MACSYMA issue.

Probably the advent of TCP has made the NCP implementation in the

The Chaosnet version of the ML device certainly won't have these

What ITS expects is for typing a character in the last column of a line to
leave the cursor in that column, and for line feeding off the last line
of the screen to scroll by the number of lines specified in the terminal
characteristics (ITS won't use this unless the user says to use scroll
mode).

Thus the -only- way to move the cursor from one line to the next is via
line feed (or %TDCRL or cursor-positioning).  The terminal is required
not to have any "intelligent" features where it secretly moves the cursor.
I assume the Lisp machine Supdup is blowing it.

OOPS.  The complete paragraph from page 3, the first part of
which is just as vital as the second:

The TCMXH variable specifies the line width in number of characters.  This
value is one less  than the screen width  (ITS indicates line overflow  by
outputting an exclamation  point at  the end  of the  display line  before
moving to the  next line).  Note:  the terminal must  not do an  automatic
CRLF when a  character is  printed in the  rightmost column.   If this  is
unavoidable, the user SUPDUP must decrement the width it sends by one.

Sorry if you get this 6 times because of all the mailing lists, but this
problem exists in many places, and should really be resolved on a global
scale.
		     ------------------------------
What we need to do is document what ITS expects to see for line width,
and what it expects the terminal to do when you try and type something
on the last line (stick versus wrap).  We should then make sure each
user implementation and the non-ITS servers strictly obey this.  (If you
read the SUPDUP RFC [a copy in MC:DCP2;RFC SUPDUP], you will find the
following, which I think is sufficient for everybody to check their
programs.

[Page 2]
The SUPDUP protocol originated as the internal protocol used between parts
of ITS, and between ITS and "intelligent" terminals.  Over the network,  a
user host acts like an intelligent terminal programmed for ITS.

[later in Page 2]
Because this is also the internals of ITS, the right to change it any time
if necessary to provide new features  is reserved by MIT.

[Page 3]
Note:  the terminal must not do an automatic CRLF when a character is
printed in the rightmost column.  If this is unavoidable, the user
SUPDUP must decrement the width it sends by one.

MC was found catatonic tonight.  Taft says this is a recurring
phenomena.  The symptoms were: extrememly long wait to get a
chaos supdup connection (if at all).  STATUS answered
immediately, however.  ^Z from the console keybaord and the VT52
took a long time to respond.  After that, loading a file looked
like it was doomed to failure (though if I waited long enough, it
may have loaded).  SYS^F, SYS1^F, .TEMP.^F all failed to give me
a directory listing.  It's been a long time since I've played at
the console, so CRASH;011483 LOOP may or may not contain anything
useful.  warm boot reload worked.

In-reply-to: The message of 13 Jan 1983 04:46-EST from David C. Plummer <DCP @ MIT-MC>


What I am trying to convey is, that we need a way to tell ITS to send
%TDQOT's argument without sending the %TDQOT itself, even when the
TCTYP is SOFTWARE, so that programs can use %TDQOT to talk funny
protocols without the necessity of changing TCTYP to PRINTING and back.


Inventing something like :TCTYP SUPDUP would work for dialups but not
for network connections, because network servers currently assume that
any %TDORS byte sent as output was caused by an output reset (they
have no way of telling whether this is so) and do the equivalent of an
output reset for telnet or whatever.  If the user wants to actually
send a %TDORS byte as data it must be quoted, as in %TDQOT %TDORS.

This means that a network server talking to a TAC with :TCTYP SOFT
must see the %TDQOT's, but only send the argument, not the %TDQOT.
On the other hand, a server talking to another SUPDUP serving host
does indeed want to pass along %TDQOT's uncensored.

By the way, the current (losing) TCP server recognises %TDORS but not
%TDQOT, so that funny microcomputer programs LMODEM and SLOSTY which
have long worked with NCP are now broken under TCP.

    TTYOPT bit 1.3 seems to be available.  Let's call it %TPQOT and simply
    have network servers look at this bit to decide whether %TDQOT should
    be sent or not, instead of checking for TCTYP=%TNSFW as is done now.
I don't understand your problem, and that won't work anyway.  My
understanding of the ITS terminal system is that characters are
translated as they are pulled out of the ITS terminal buffer.  If
the terminal type is software, then no translation is done.
Because you are on a software terminal ITS will not look at
anything (including %TDQOT) and therefore just send it out.
Also, this translation is probably done before the implemention
of STYNET sees the character, so "have network servers look" will
do no good.  The net result is that what you send to a
super image output channel that is %TNSFW is exacly what the
other end (terminal or STY) will see.  You do get raw 8bit
strings.

I've been using SUPDUP on 8080 and 6502 personal computers to access
ITS for years now, started using data compression about a year ago.
My program SLOSTY is a modified PTY which does a simple Huffman code.
I was planning to move up to fractional bits and other hairy codings,
but lost interest when I quit logging in via the ARPAnet.

Not being able to output arbitrary 8-bit strings defeats the whole
purpose of doing data compression.  It *IS* possible to output 8-bit
strings from ITS, but it requires the ugly kludge of setting TCTYP to
PRINTING in order for %TDQOT and %TDORS to work properly, restoring
the original TCTYP when done.

TTYOPT bit 1.3 seems to be available.  Let's call it %TPQOT and simply

Do you actually have this and the datacompression implemented? On
what machines?

By the way, you should not really need to send arbitrary eight-bit-strings
just because you are doing data-compression. Certainly it is more
convenient if you do, but you can certainly encode the information
in whatever arbitrary characters that are available.

In-reply-to: The message of 01/10/83 18:22:27 from GSB@MIT-ML

In order to support data-compression and other non-SUPDUP protocols
peculiar to personal computers, we need to be able to output ARBITRARY
EIGHT BIT STRINGS to the user.  ITS currently does this in a grossly
crappy way, using %TDQOT in Super-Image output mode.  Since this is
the ONLY mechanism for doing this, it shouldn't interact with the
user's TCTYP, but it does.  Users with terminals that happen to
understand %TD codes get screwed because ITS does not simply send
%TDQOT's argument, it sends the %TDQOT as well.  This is no good.

There should be a +%TPSUP bit analogous to %TPTEL to say you are
talking to a SUPDUP connection.  Programs that check TCTYP=%TNSFW now
should look at this bit instead.

After thinking about it for a while, I agree with Moon and you will
find that the TCP STYNET similarly lacks flow control on input.  This
not only provides the best approximation to being directly connected, but
also is by far the simplest way to avoid having things get hung up.
I don't see any point in "fixing" this, unless we also worry about
trying to fix direct and dialed-in TTY lines.  Note that the intelligent
terminal protocol does allow the terminal to hack flow control and make
sure that stuff gets to ITS (or whatever program) properly.

I guess you could compare this Alto lossage with someone trying to
play back a recording of modem tones into a MC dialup and expecting
ITS to exert flow control!

I see that KLH just discovered that in Chaos STYNET, there is no flow control,
and Moon comments that it's only a problem with line-at-a-time input.  This
gives rise to two questions:  Is it similarly a problem with Arpa STYNET, and
is it worth fixing so that intelligent terminals and hosts can shove script
files across the network and have them work as expected?

It is kind of painful that DDT doesn't repurify itself or anything

to do this.  I don't necessarily advocate that DDT actually dump
itself to SYS;ATSIGN DDT (a little dangerous since so much stuff
depends on that), but at least it ought to be able to re-set whatever
variables or stuff it has to, to compensate for running under a
new system version.  A little slower on startup, but at least not

    The TTYSMT variable already has other non-graphics information in it.
    It has information about local-editing and line-saving capability, I
    believe.
Indeed true.  To determine if the terminal supports supdup graphics you
test the BIT in ttysmt which is for that purpose; it is incorrect to
test the entire variable against zero.

reserved for graphics information only.  That is, a graphics server
would always be able to tell that the device didn't support graphics if
TTYSMT was zero.  Are you sure this is what you want to do, rather than

Symbolics has imprisoned me in sunny southern California for 3
weeks.  I still log into MC occaisionally which isn't too
difficult since we do happen to be on the chaosnet.  If any of
you have ever seen me hacking on MC, my prompt that DDT prints
out has an amazing amount of junk in it.  One of those items is
the time.  Unfortunately, it is eastern time, not pacific time.
Sooo... ALAN and I started making joking comments to each other
about time zone correction in prompts, and this is what happened.

I don't know how many of us bug-its, bug-twenex, bug-supdup or
bug-lispm are going to take this seriously, but if I find some
spare time I may make local modifications to this LISPM and hack
my prompt code accordingly.  I will probably get around to
putting it in the KTVs and MINITS systems at some point in time.

One way to write this tool would be to use the SYSCALL function in MacLisp.

Actually there is a problem that a lot of system calls have side effects on
specific jobs.  (Like the :IOPEN kludge opens a channel \in the current
job/.)  What you REALLY want then is a DDT command that does what you said,
but in the current job.  [The idea is to replace the sequence of commands

:DOCALL prompts for a system call name, prints the relevant documentation

special magical abilities to cons up <TTY>, <JOB>, etc. type args, or open
channels in the fashion of :IOPEN.  It then executes the call, and types
out the values for you, or types out the error code if it failed to work.

need to create too, but then have to gun the server (if
they can figure out what the user name is)...

ELLEN told me that when the dover goes down people still

Sounds like an excellent idea.  Terminal 0 and/or whatever terminal
is the system console should probably be left alone, hardwired, though.

Perhaps this can be done by a demon loaded at startup, which simply
uses a special system call to copy the info?  Perhaps this call should
only work once, and then enable non-system-console terminals, and cause
the ITS IN OPERATION message to be printed when it is done.  This would
prevent clobbering terminals already in use.  Alternatively, it could
be careful and ignore terminals which are in use.  This would minimize
the amount of EXEC code and debugging.

ITS should probably read a binary parameter file on startup to
initialize its TTY tables rather than having them built in.
This table can be maintained by a simple utility program that
grovels over a source file, like HOSTSn does for HOSTS >.
The network code will need to do something similar in order to
initialize its gateway tables.
If no objections, I may go ahead and do this.

I should know better than to frivolously show people MASTER mode, but anyway...
Proceeding a job in Master mode without the TTY causes output on that
TTY to be wedged, in that the <crlf>* that DDT echoes after ^P never happens.
Output from comm links continues to work, however.  Now for the real
killer:  if that tree is then detached, the poor sucker who reowns it gets
wedged, just by reowning it (his HACTRN says :$ Reowned $, then nothing more.)
Stealing MASTER mode away, by grabbing it in another process, results in the
wedged jobs continuing as if nothing had happened.

This was all on MC, just now, version 1283.  I tried to do the same thing on
AI, to determine whether it was KL-specific, and discovered to my horror that
not only does the same bug exist, but it apparantly wedges ALL sty's, since
I was unable to log in again to clean up, being told that All network ports were

I rebooted the front-end 11 per MOON's instructions about 2 hours ago.
Local terminals were badly wedged, although Chaosnet connections seemd
to be going through okay; it was however complaining periodically that
no more chaosnet buffers were available.  A typical example of wedgedness
is that echo on the VT52 next to the console was at least 20 chars behind
typein, and some typein seemed to be getting lost or at least processed
in random spurts (only when one had pumped enough chars at it would anything
happen).
The rebooting seems to have fixed everything for now.  Moon apparently
thinks that the Dover spooler might have had something to do with
the overall problem, but you'd have to ask him for any details.  Something
was very obviously clobbered in the 11.  Perhaps when the Chaosnet goes
wild, something overflows into the TTY buffers/pointers or otherwise
throws a big wrench into the works?  Pure speculation, I'm not familiar
with it.  It might even be the other way around, that some glitch in
TTY handling (owing to the preponderance of "loose lines" blasting noise
at the front-end) is screwing up not only the TTYs but the Chaosnet.

does a binary compare like /# but with the difference that the
files must be executable programs; SRCCOM will create two
inferior processes and load the files into them in order to compare
the two address spaces.  This completely flushes any spurious
diffs due to symbols, MIDAS info, blocking size, or SBLK/PDUMP

If nobody (mostly me, I guess) finds problems with it over the

    better than teach ITS, you should get a crew together and bring one up.

Unfortuantely that would require the cooperation of the owner(s)
of a machine up on which (garp) to bring it.  Here are the
options I know of:

There are rumors of the AI lab looking for a used -10 (KL
probably) to appease the people who can't stand 20X and would
prefer ITS.  This would be an idea machine.

Bring up ITS on an existing PDP-20.  The only machine this is
feasible on is OZ, and the feasibility of that seems to be
asymptotically approaching zero (unless you want to pull of a
coop some night).  This would also require some microcode
expertise.  Moon obviously comes to mind.  His commitment at
symbolics also comes to mind.

Bring it up on a non-10 architecture.  This would be a lot of
fun.  The obvious choice is a vax.  OK, who has the vax, who has
the time, and who has the money to sponser such a moderate
project?  (Be prepared to be able to answer "What's wrong with
Unix?"  I'm sure each one of us can give some very good answers,
but just be prepared.)

TK actually suggested writing a report on ITS which described its

If I have some spare time during this TCP hacking, I can look into
this.  The problem is not really that NAMES is so big, but that COMSAT
is so stupid about how it handles the compiled result.  There are at
least three things I can think of right away that would help eliminate
this problem (this does not mean they are easy to do).  For the time
being, keeping NAMES small ought to buy enough time.

    The system ran out of ARPAnet sockets (I think) and would not accept
    incoming TELNET connections. Other sites seemed to think MC had died.

    to do with the DOVER, like RFC133.

Yes.  These are wedged XX jobs.  When I frequented MC I would
typically find several in one day.  Either ITS has a bug closing
connections, or XX has the bug (perhaps both).  I don't know NCP
so I don't know if the above state is reasonable.

I presume an @FILE takes up much less space than several name in a mailing

and collect log files for otherwise homeless mailing lists.  This would
also provide a nice central place to look at when some disk storage is
needed (ie. by trimming old log files), which could actually result in
less disk storage being used by log files.

I'm not volunteering to do this quite yet, but if I don't hear any

There is a theory that part of the OZ wait-30-seconds problem is
that the AI-Chaos-11 does not always have the power to bridge
between subnets 6 and 1.  If chaos sites think that ai-chaos-11
is the best route, when indeed it cannot route, then there will
be a stalling effect until either ai-chaos-11 unwedges or
mc-io-11 becomes the best route.  This could take 15 to
30 seconds depending on how wedged ai-chaos-11 is.

If this is the problem, then I may have improved the situation.
I have modified the program that runs in ai-chaos-11 to give a
higher cost for the cable subnets than mc-io-11.  This should
cause subnet 6 sites to always use mc-io-11 to get to subnet 1
and vice-versa (except of course when mc-io-11 is down, in which
case the routing mechanism will figure out ai-chaos-11 can get
there).  This will take effect at the next reload of ai-chaos-11
(which happens to be down right now meaning no dover service to
chaos sites).

The correct solution, of course, is to put the oz-network-11 on
subnet 6 as well as subnet 1.  This is not happening due to a
lack of hardware (unibus chaos interfaces).

.;crash chaos is a crash where the system ran out of chaos buffers and
got slow (so I'm told).  All the buffers but one I could find were UNC's from
BAK DOVER to socket 21 (octal) on the Dover Alto.  Perhaps the IO-11 had really
crashed, and that's why it wasn't swallowing the packets.  Perhaps ITS should
notice when the number of packets on DLCXMQ gets large and start throwing them
away.

Good News! (again)

Well, the last patch wasn't QUITE enough, but we were on the right trail.
REM apparently had his hopes dashed this weekend when SU-TAC continued
displaying THE BUG.

Further testing and reading of spagetti code proved beyond a shadow of
a doubt that the "wedging" occurred when ITS sent the TELNET IAC character
in one message, and followed with the DataMark in the next.  Thumbing
through the coroutines eventually showed that we were returning wrong
in this case.

I have a patch, already in SU-TAC, which will be released to the rest of
the net tomorrow morning.  It still is possible that there is some other
case which causes wedging, so I won't claim that it can't happen again,
but I don't think that it will.  

Sorry for the first false hopes, hope this one works...

Good news!

I found a local ITS afficionado, and with his help I was able 
to get the bug to happen.  I discovered that what was happening
was that the TAC would receive an NCP INS, which TELNET needs
as a signal to start discarding terminal output, but it was
not finding a matching TELNET DataMark in the data stream, 
the signal to STOP discarding terminal output.  The funny thing
was that the symptoms were so intermittent.

Reading the TAC code, I found that if we receive a message 
containing the TELNET intercept character, IAC, in one message,
and the DataMark was the first character of the next message,
then the TAC would fail to see the DataMark.  I have patched
my test TAC and have since been unable to re-create the bug.
I therefore hypothesize that ITS will occasionally send the IAC
in one message and the DataMark in another: can any ITS network
hackers verify or refute this?

ARPANET TACs should have received the patch by tomorrow morning,
so I would greatly appreciate hearing whether there is indeed a
difference.  It is possible that this fix will also cure the
flakiness seen in negotiating TELNET binary mode with the TAC;
anybody who has experienced those difficulties, PLEASE tell me
if there is any change.

I'm sorry this bug has been hanging (no pun intended) around so
long, but I thank you for your patience and perseverence; we
do want to hear about bugs, and we try to fix them as soon as
possible, but the ones that people are finding now are getting
to be the more subtle ones, so they do take longer...

AI is being backed up these days, and its disks seem fairly stable.  The
processor hardware is not currently flaking out, although we have no idea how
long that will last.  When I connect to it, often in the daytime, I am usually
the only user using it.  If we do indeed reconnect AI to the Chaosnet, then
it'll make a pretty good mail computer, so I see no reason not to leave
BUG-RANDOM-PROGRAM on it.

Something we should take note of here is that Eric Ostrom, in his capacity as
AI Lab Facilities Coordinator or some fancy title, has tracked down a KL Model
A CPU (a la MC) that is being sold for $7500, supposedly in working order.  The
idea is to provide a machine of MC's power to AI lab members who prefer ITS to
Twenex.  If we bought one it would probably go where AI is now, both physically
and spiritually (including network ports).  Extra space would need to be
allotted for memory; presumably 921 (Marty's office) would go away.

Everyone who would like to see AI have a KL Model A running ITS should send a
message to the effect to Eric@ee (not at OZ, where he doesn't read his mail),
and CC it to PHW.  Something strong along the lines of "I understand you're
considering getting a KL to run ITS, well, do," is probably appropriate.

    Alex Krymm (our new hardware person) has agreed to take a look at the prints
    for ML's Chaosnet interface and consider building one for AI.

    Questions:
    Is it really worth it?  That is, will this just be a lot of thankless work for
    him?  Or is it comparatively simple?  Is someone who understands the hardware
    well around to answer the occasional question?
I'll be happy to answer questions within the limited amount of time I have
available.

    Would he have to do
    wirewrapping, or do we have wirelists that we can send to Augat?
Of course not.  It would be machine-wrapped.

The only issue is finding documentation on the AI TTL I/O bus plus figuring
out whether it is still there.  It is unlikely to be 100% compatible with
the ML/DM TTL I/O bus, hence the Chaosnet interface would need some small
changes.  If it's not still there it would need to be retrieved from wherever
it went and hooked up again.  I imagine Knight could help with this.

CHAOS EOF packets:

There are two things going on here.  First is that ITS will allow
an EOF packet to be sent that has a non-zero bytelength for the
data field.  I don't think this is right.  Second is that doing a
TWENEX SIN JSYS on a chaos channel which has received an EOF will
give you the bogus data in the EOF before signalling the end of
file.

Case in point: The gensym server on MC originally didn't set the
byte length of the EOF, so twenex would print whatever happened
to be in the packet at the time.  For example,
	@type cha:mc.gensym_foobar
	19EGSNMYF OOAB
instead of just
	19

    1) Is it really the case that there can't be more than about 8 jobdevices at
    any one time?  I guess this is reasonable since there usually isn't any more
    than about 4 active at any one time.
Yes.
    2) I hope that the LMODEM program is taking the proper precautions to prevent
    the user from using up infinite channels.  The maintainers should spend a
    minute or two thinking about correctly unwind-protecting their program so that
    this can't happen if they haven't already (in which case they should think
    about possible bugs).

In this case, it isn't LMODEM's problem.  They're staying around after
LMODEM's channels have been closed.

    3) What are archive devices waiting for when they go to sleep?  Normally they
    seem to hang.  These behaved as if they were waiting for a lock to free up.
    (The fact that they all disappeared after I gunned a couple presumably
    indicates that archive devices take the correct actions to insure that locks
    will be unlocked when jobs get killed.)  Is there some sort of deadly embrace
    that is known to happen?

Usually they're waiting for the lock to be freed that is held by
whichever one of them that got the error.  Generally, the error is a
clobbered archive.  It used to be true, may still be true, that having
the archive too large to map would cause it to be permanently broken
in this way.

    4) Since the job on the user end of the job channel had gone away, shouldn't
    the job devices have been told about it?  I don't find anything specific in the
    job device documentation about what happens when the user goes away, but I
    thought that the system simulated a .CLOSE on any channels associated with
    any terminated jobs, but this would have cleaned things up wouldn't it?
    (I just tried this myself, and that seems to be the case...)
Yes, but the ARCHIVE device doesn't allow any of this until it's
gotten the lock.
    5) Perhaps the .SLEEP that the archive device is using (where?) shouldn't be
    forever, but instead it should wake up every five minutes and be sure it still
    has a reason to live.

Alex Krymm (our new hardware person) has agreed to take a look at the prints
for ML's Chaosnet interface and consider building one for AI.

Questions:
Is it really worth it?  That is, will this just be a lot of thankless work for
him?  Or is it comparatively simple?  Is someone who understands the hardware
well around to answer the occasional question?  Would he have to do
wirewrapping, or do we have wirelists that we can send to Augat?

with advice from moon and much assistance from alan (who did most of
the actual work), Puff-The-Magic namedragon has been copied over from
ML to do namedragonish things like keeping track of logout times.
apparently the LOGOUT TIMES file has not been written to since the
knight tvs were last patched out (presumably Taraka Namdrg wants to
display on them before modifying the file?).

we first considered patching Taraka Namdrg to not try to write out to
the knight tvs, but that proved much too hairy.

Subject:  archive device overload
To: BUG-ITS at MIT-MC, BUG-LMODEM at MIT-MC

I noticed that my attempts to use the DIR device were reporting DEVICE FULL
errors, and since the system was far from full I deduced that we had run out of
some resource specific to jobdevices.  Sure enough, there were eight or so
sleeping archive devices.  They were all associated with a nonexistant job that
had presumably once been named <uname> LMODEM.  (Although PEEK could have been
mistaken about this if the job number had been recycled, the fact that they
were all using an archive on the CPM directory backs this up.)  I gunned a
couple of them and suddenly the rest disappeared.  I have several questions:

1) Is it really the case that there can't be more than about 8 jobdevices at
any one time?  I guess this is reasonable since there usually isn't any more
than about 4 active at any one time.

2) I hope that the LMODEM program is taking the proper precautions to prevent
the user from using up infinite channels.  The maintainers should spend a
minute or two thinking about correctly unwind-protecting their program so that
this can't happen if they haven't already (in which case they should think
about possible bugs).

3) What are archive devices waiting for when they go to sleep?  Normally they
seem to hang.  These behaved as if they were waiting for a lock to free up.
(The fact that they all disappeared after I gunned a couple presumably
indicates that archive devices take the correct actions to insure that locks
will be unlocked when jobs get killed.)  Is there some sort of deadly embrace
that is known to happen?

4) Since the job on the user end of the job channel had gone away, shouldn't
the job devices have been told about it?  I don't find anything specific in the
job device documentation about what happens when the user goes away, but I
thought that the system simulated a .CLOSE on any channels associated with
any terminated jobs, but this would have cleaned things up wouldn't it?
(I just tried this myself, and that seems to be the case...)

5) Perhaps the .SLEEP that the archive device is using (where?) shouldn't be
forever, but instead it should wake up every five minutes and be sure it still
has a reason to live.

There has been a lot of traffic recently about this TAC/ITS telnet bug.
There are many misconceptions about what is going on in the TAC, and I
can only assume that much of the speculation I see about what ITS is doing
is also wrong.  I am currently looking into this problem, and trying to
sort out the facts.  It would be helpful if I had a contact at MIT who
could get me access to and account on MIT-MC and who would KNOW what MC
is supposed to do in these funny situations.  Any volunteers?  I expect 
to be doing some investigation during this coming week.  I can be
reached via netmail or at BBN (497-3196).

One major confusion about the TAC relates to its buffer sizes.  The TAC
has static buffering on input and dynamic buffering on output, and both
input and output buffers are relatively small.  The TIP's buffers could
be of any size, depending on the configuration of the machine.  The TAC
does not have, nor will it ever have, 1000 character buffers for 63 
terminals in a 32K word machine...

Because the TACs (the new TIP) seem to misimplement to TELNET
protocol.  When ITS tries to flush the data in the network using
the same method that works on TIPs it causes things to come to a
grinding halt.  I suspect someone just removed the code that
attempts to do the flushing as begin better than wedging.

[Is BUG-ITS the right place for all of this??]

My Versatec spooler understands KST files; it has nothing to do
with the Versatec.  If you read DCP;PRESS ANOUNC you will see
that when the Versatec spooler TRIES to do press files, it
translates the press fonts into somee (hopefully) reasonable XGP
font.

If you are trying to get closer to the state of the art, flush
XGP format files.  In theory (if I turned on XGP file recognition
in the spooler), XGP files produced by R come out correctly, but
XGP files produced by TJ6 or BOLIO (and I think @) cause it to
crash.  This is interesting, becuase the :DOVER program does the
exact opposite (does everything (as far as I can tell) EXCEPT R
produced XGP files).  "Well, why don't you look at :DOVER to see
how it does it?" you might ask.  I did; it is just as
incomprehensible when it comes to XGP files as anything else I've
seen.

When the Ten-11 interface is enabled, AI goes into an infinite loop
while trying to initialize the Chaos-11's buffers.  The NXM light stays
off when it's running, but it quickly lights up when single-stepping.
This occurs around pc=60477 (T11CK2) with the TV-11 disabled (so it
won't die trying to hack the TV-11).  Single-stepping this loop seems to
show a SETZM instruction skipping.  Perhaps the single-step key is
bouncy, but this instruction is trying to write a zero into the Chaos-11
so it might be related to the Ten-11 failure.  Would someone look at the
crash dump in the file AI:CRASH;TREE TOAD and check this out?  AI is
only available via ARPAnet because it can't talk to the PDP-11's.

        One question?  If ITS sends a IAC WILL BINARY to a TIP or
        TAC, does this turn off interpretation of the IAC character
        somehow, so it should no longer be doubled?  That would be
        nasty.

    An IAC is only doubled when a 377 wants to pass all the way
    through the TELNET stream.  This is still the case when a machine
    is in TRANSMIT BINARY. 

    I think there is a big difference of opinion on the intercept
    character issue.  Characcters go from KEYBOARD to COMMAND
    PROCESSOR to TELNET STREAM to FOREIGN TELNET STREAM.  Normally
    the command processor passes through characters to the telnet
    stream, unless the intercept character is typed.  The impression
    from some people I get is that if the TAC goes into TRANSMIT
    BINARY, then the command processor will not trap the intercept
    character.  Well, my opinion is that that is a completely
    cretenous behavior.  TRANSMIT BINARY only has to do with the
    TELNET STREAM, and not the COMMAND PROCESSOR.  If TACS will not
    intercept @ when in TRANSMIT BINARY, then it is in violation of
    the description of TRANSMIT BINARY found in the April 1976
    ARPANET PROTOCOL HANDBOOK.  I doubt it has changed.

There is a difference in opinion.  The command processor is free to
decide when it's appropriate to catch the intercept character and when
it's not, and currently it does the most reasonable thing.

TIP users would be grossly inconvenienced if command characters were
intercepted in binary mode.  Fortunately they aren't.  This issue is
totally outside the scope of the protocol, and I saw no mention of it
in the APRAnet Protocol Handbook - can you give me a page number?

I spent several hours this morning trying to track down a sporadic TAC or TELSER bug
wherein either the TAC gets wedged and refuses to accept binary output when ITS wants
to do so, or else it accepts and TELSER is too wedged to notice the ack from the TAC.

Couldn't duplicate it once the symptoms became clear enough to try to get them on purpose.
Who has done this before?  Is there some interaction or protocol change I'm unaware of?
I'm not sure whether the TAC or TELSER is at fault.  The basic symptom is that I will
send IAC WILL BINARY (I do :imgout 377 373 0 at DDT) and the TRBINF in telser stays zero.
Alternating between WILL and WONT produces no effect either.

To: BUG-ITS at MIT-MC

TelSer should always initialize TelNet connections with IAC WILL BINARY.

TCTYP really should try to adjust a TIP or TAC connection when %TPMTA
is called for, maybe by means of a new keyword, like EIGHT or META.
If connected via a TIP/TAC, TCTYP should then issue IAC DO BINARY.

Extensive experiments tonight with USC-TAC show that everything will
work fine if you tell a TAC that ITS is going to transmit binary.

It works well for some people to ask the TIP/TAC to transmit binary,
but this disables @ interception, and will thus screw many TIP/TAC
users.  The only way they'd have to undo this is either hang up and
redial the TIP/TAC, or log out and wait for TelSer's 2 minute timeout.
Since I need this feature to enable my terminal's META key, I have
fixed my login file to do :IMGOUT 377 373 0 and logout to do :IMGOUT
377 376 0 when my TCTYP specifies %TPMTA.  These magic numbers are IAC
DO BINARY and IAC DONT BINARY respectively.

Apropos nothing in particular, the TIP manual claims that if the host
sends 207 <command> ^J to a TIP in OLD TELNET it will work as if the
user had typed @ <command> ^J on his terminal, but it does work on
TACs so I guess New TelNet never evolved a replacement for this
necessary feature, or are they STILL ruinning OLD TELNET???

I think MINITS does do the decrement hack necessary for ITS.  I

I am SUPDUPing to MC.  I have tried printing files which have
lines lengths greater than that of the terminal and cannot make
it fail.  I suspect the problem is actually the setup modes of
the terminal.  ITS assumes (or enforces in the initial string)
and MINITS assumes (but does not currently have an initial string
to enforce it with) that /terminals/ DO NOT automatically wrap
when a character is displayed on the last column.  This may be a
personal preference, but if you are on an AAA and if the second
bit of setup mode D is on, turn it off and tell me if it still
loses.  If you type S to get out of setup, it will save the

When Supdup'ing to MC, MINITS (I guess) incorrectly supports over-run lines.
it seems that they don't end up incrementing ITS' notion of what line it's 
on, so at the bottom of the screen, some hardware scrolling happens because
ITS doesn't realize soon enough that it's time to give a --more-- break and 
pop to the top of the screen. this effect is easy to reproduce.
just print a file which has lines longer than the line length and watch what
happens as you reach the bottom of the screen.

I think you are confused (though it could be me).  DO TRANSMIT
BINARY does not mean the TAC can't trap its escape character, itjust
means it should not do any special processing on the characters.
There is another option I belive for complete binary transmission
which cannot be reverted; I do not think TRANSMIT BINARY is that option.
I gues one of us should check the protocol specification...

DO TRANSMIT BINARY would screw people who try to close their ITS
connection and reconnect, since in binary mode the TIP (TAC) does not
hack local user commands.  Perhaps the TIP/TAC ressets this when you
close the connection?  It would still be boring to logout and have to
wait until TelSer gets around to closing your connection.

Currently TelSer knows about CR and CRLF and sets your TCTYP in
accordance with the protocol you are sending, so this is no problem.

Is there any reason why ITS should change a %TDFS into a space
on overprinting terminals?  Here is the problem:

I am on an overprinting terminal, SUPDUPing to ITS.  I Telnet
to a system that can't deal with overprinting terminal.  VAX VMS
and I think VAX Unix have this problem.  When using CHTN, I toggle
VT52 emulation mode and tell the VAX I have a vt52 (with perhaps 
a higher screen).  When the foreign system sends an ESCAPE C (or 
whatever it is that goes forward), CHTN tells ITS to go forward.
When ITS is sending to a replacing terminal, it sends %TDFS (I hope),
but for an overprinting terminal (which it still thinks I am in this
case), it sends a space (which unfortunately is now destructive).

If TELSER sends WILL TRANSMIT BINARY, then that only allows ITS
to send binary to the TAC.  You also want DO TRANSMIT BINARY
which lets the TAC legally send binary to ITS.  I aggree that
most times there will be no noticiable difference in terminal
handling.  When a user types both RETURN and LINEFEED to
something like DDT, ITS may get marginally confused, but thems
the breaks. 

I do not use TACs.  Somebody that does should try out a new
TELSER on MC or ML some night and see if it works.  Make sure CR,
LF, and CR LF all do what you expect.  Compare with old behavior.

When TIPs were generally used, the default output mode was (apparently) binary, but now that TACs are in vogue, terminal programs that used to work with TIPs lose, because they are only receiving 7 bits.

chris, leaving yellow-pad notes on the ai system console is better than
nothing as a way to indicate what its particular brokenness is, but
ignores the problem that the note might fall off. please record the 
brokenness state in the ai system logbook, so other people will know
what's going on (also for a semi-permanent record -- lossage like the
disk breaking needs to become part of general memory). thx.

Subject:H19 emulators, and lossage and ANSI mode

In implementing multiple insert/delete line for H19's, I used ANSI mode because
it was the only way to get it (as I imagine you know if you wrote an emulator).
This is what CRTSTY does.  Looks to me like there are two possibilities; a new
terminal type could be implemented (call it HDS or whatever) that would output
only HDS codes, or a bit could be defined to say don't do multiple operations.
I guess I'll do one of them when I get back.  If anyone thinks one way is more
tasteful than the other, let me know.  I lean towards a separate type because
it's easier to do :TCTYP HDS than :TCTYP H19 NO MULTIPLE (or worse yet, specify
the bits).

certain h-19 emulators don't support ANSI mode and no longer work with the latest ITS.
short-distance screen scrolling in EMACS still works, but when trying to scroll the
text a long way it just puts trash on the display, and I have to clear the screen (slow)
Since the emulation I'm using is on a micro i suppose I could try to hack some new code,
but the display driver has limited memeory in which to live, because when screen RAM is
mapped in, most user RAM is mapped out to make room for the video.

perhaps TECO can be kludged with some flag saying to insert/delete one at a time?

    I pressed ctrl-S to stop output on second window (screen) of
    a ^R (PRINT), which has been doing this for weeks since the

My theory is that ITS is doing an output reset, which is turning
into a data mark or interrupt process or something in the TELNET
protocol, and that TACs don't understand this.  You will probably
find that ^G will do the same thing.  Has the TELNET protocol
dropped this feature?  Is ITS doing the wrong thing?  Or is this
missing from the implementation of TACs.

Could somebody forward this to the code writers of the TAC

    I'm using one of the old ann arbors (it doesn't even have n-key rollover).
    With the new ITS there are several problems which I can't really explain.
    First, inside mail I am unable to type a rubout or C-Z.  A rubout seems to
    turn into a C-W since the previous word always gets deleted.  C-Z's don't
    do anything.  THis is not true when talking to DDT or EMACS.  Lock seems to
    idicate that that the right codes are being sent.

    Second, when I logout the DDT seems to revert to the same mode that MAIL
    and SEND are in.  As a consequence, I can't log back in.

Since most of the Ann Arbors at the lab are new, and have meta keys, Ann Arbors
are initialized with +%TPMTA.  Older Ann Arbors, like yours, don't have meta
keys.  Looks like ^Z and rubout are being read as meta-^Z and meta-rubout.
If you do
:TCTYP AAA -%TPMTA
you should win.

ITS 1278 is now installed on ML, AI, and MC.  It contains support for Ann
Arbors, and the code for H19's has been rewritten to include multiple
insert/delete line/char.  TYMPAD has been changed to allow padding with nulls.
H19's are being successfully padded with nulls, but it doesn't help a whole
lot, because the padding for insert/delete operations isn't happening at the
most featureful time imaginable.  I'll fix this when I get back from vacation.

I'm trying to fix TS3TTY so that H19's are padded with nulls, and can do
multiple insert/delete line, like Ann Arbors do (no more of this weenie weenie
stuff).  I think I'm winning.  But I can't tell.

Why can't I tell?  Well, AI has no H19's hung on it, and it can't pump out the
characters at 9600 baud anyway, and that's when things get critical.  So what I
usually do is go downstairs and connect an H19 to MC, and Telnet over to AI and
do a :TCTYP H19 locally.  And I lose; the padding, or the insert/delete line
stuff, just doesn't seem to work; the terminal gets confused, and outputs
things in random places, and I go back and grovel over the code some more.

But last night I distilled a listing and injected it into my brain, and this
afternoon when I saw that I was losing, I knew damned well that I should be
winning, so I went over to a VT52, and Telnetted from it (on MC) to ML.  Its
terminal type was set to VT52 on both machines, and it exhibited the same sort
of lossage that H19's were exhibiting for me.  RMS suggested that perhaps the
local machine didn't know its speed, so I set that to 9600 in both places, and
it still lost.  In fact, absolute positioning and insert/delete line/character
type things seem to consistently lose through a Telnet.  I believe I remember
hearing this ascribed to VTS when people used to Telnet to XX when it first
came up.

Try this simple experiment: log in on a local terminal on ML, or DM, or MC, or
maybe even AI, although I don't know if it's fast enough to cause the lossage.
Telnet over to another machine (even the one you're on!), do TTY^K, and watch
it go!

Just so other people who look at AI don't spin wheels unnecessarily.
AI is currently dropping dead during the instruction following LPMR's
(and possibly other pager related instructions).  There also appears
to be a bad file in the acount directory (cdata or something) which
prevents the system from coming up, but which the salvager seems
incapable of fixing trivially.  I haven't looked at this second problem
very hard.  The following loop will hang the processor:

LMPR
JFCL
JFCL
AOJA .-3

PC stops at lpmr + 2, having fetched and done the fetch cycle (including
PC increment) of the instruction at lmpr + 1.
I probably won't get a chance to look at this further for a few days.
I'd suggest a debugging strategy of using the logic analyzer to locate the
place where the pulse train drops dead.  This might be caused by additional
pulses coming back from the pager.  A likely failure is the TTL-DEC converters
going to the pager.

AI's problems, after 2 nights of hacking, turned out to be software [sort-of].
The system was getting page faults referencing NXM exec pages, while PI in progress
on channel 7.  The problem had to do with a location in the TV-11 being the exactly
wrong value to cause the LDB and ADD at SSLCK8+4 or so to produce an address of
one more than the page boundary.  This was compounded and made more difficult to find
by a second bug in which turning off the 10-11 code makes the chaonet clock routine
reference exec NXM, again at clock level, without checking the TEN11F flag.
This happens on calls to T11CHK, which should just popj if TEN11F is disabled.
This problem was eventually debugged with clipleads halting the machine on exec
memory protect failures.
The bugs have not been patched, but the system will presumably "never" get into
that state again.  I'll edit the sources after breakfast.

This is usually due to running out of disk channels, and deadlocking
where you have several programs each of which wants a lot of disk channels,
has some, and is waiting for more.  COMPLR and PUB are prime offenders
in this respect since they open many channels and keep them open for
many minutes.  You can look at the variable in the system whose name

Would whoever slammed the door please consider that 99% of

While this is being put to rights, how about flushing PWORD

Supdup figures that when you type <break>P you probably don't even want it as
your current job anymore, so it cleverly sets some OTHER job as being current.
That's what it's doing when it valrets <alt>1J to your DDT, it's trying to
select your PREVIOUSLY selected job.  This is why you somtimes get the error
message JOB GONE? when leaving a supdup (the previously selected job has
dissapeared since you started your supdup).

GJC@MIT-MC 06/22/82 23:31:39 Re: the strangest thing
To: (BUG ITS) at MIT-MC
I was running :CHTN HTJR, a vax running VMS. On the Vax I ran a program
which does a lot of I/O displaying information like a PEEK program
(it was a peek type program) and taking character input at interrupt level.
I ran this peek program looking at itself, and low and behold the CHTN
was too busy or something to listen very well, even to the CHTN break
character. That is, I found I could not break out of CHTN nor get
any response from the VAX which just kept outputing characters.
I then hung up the phone and redialed MC.
Being brave, I then did :UJOB GJC HACTRO and :SNARF CHTN.
The CHTN and the DDT then seemed to have control of the TTY at
the *same* time, DDT getting characters only once in a while
with the CHTN doing lots of output to my TTY. I then HUNG UP the phone
again, and sent this bug note.

Later... It seems I can reproduce this condition at will.

I removed a few obviously obsolete entries; others should do the same.  It may

As I explained when we were deciding what operating system to

It's possible but unlikely.  The problem is that the inter-ITS
devices simply relay system calls from the remote machine to the foreign
machine.  20X has, of course, different system calls, and not all
the ITS system calls map simply into 20X system calls.  There is also
the issue of incompatible file name lengths and syntax.

On the other hand, since it was done for the FC: it can probably be
done for OZ also assuming someone is available to do the work.
If the FC: device used the standard file access protocol that 20X
already supports, it would have been trivial to extend it into an OZ:
device.  Since it uses a private protocol instead, either that protocol
will have to be implemented on TOPS-20 or an entirely new job-device
program will have to be written.

    DDT could avoid this by doing its interrupt-level typeout

DDT doesn't do interrupt-level typeout.  DDT gets interrupted and goes
off and does other typeout, via the HAKKAH kludge.  I think the problem
is with ECHOED (at ITS interrupt level) typeout anyway, not with DDT's

I think it would be a good thing to change the DEFAULT filename used by FIND.
The reason is that many people on the "USERS" type directories use find
to find their files, and these people invariably type something like
:FIND FOO*** therefore they end up searching the entire filesystem. In many
cases they aren't fully aware that they have been put on some directory
USERS7 lets say, so FIND is their only reasonable tool for listing the
files they own. Furthermore, if somebody does want to search the entire
filesystem, (perhaps not such a rare thing to do back in the days of ITS
when the FIND program was written) I think it reasonable to make the
person type something like :FIND ******;FOO.

This happens when you have enabled DDT to search directories recently
looked at, and one of the directorys you recently looked at doesn't
exist (locally).  DDT is telling you the actual error it got.  ITS
is telling you what was wrong with what DDT gave it.  DDT shouldn't
be putting things on its list of recent directories without verifying
that they exist, but I'm in no hurry to fix this very occasional
minor annoyance.

If you have some files which you urgently want and they're zeroed on
pack 15, why dont you ask for them to be restored by sending mail to
File-Retrieve.

Due to multiple theories about how to proceed, the original
restoration process was somewhat screwed up.  Now, things that arent
asked for specially will get restored as people have time to do so.

I examined the system log, and the lossage of last friday happened
something like this.

1) a user logged in as MINI0, :CHUNAMed to CRETIN, and started to
   play.  First he/she copied DDT to the file sys;z ddt, then copied
   that file to SYS3;TS OCTPUS . This would allow logging in from
   PWORD without a password.

2) CRETIN then logged out, and then ___010 took over. First he/she
   deleted PANDA, then LOCK.  


Account MINI0 has been deleted. As has account CRETIN. The OCTPUS
(camaflaged DDT) has been deleted. LOCK has been reinstalled.
The system is approximately as it was.

    This morning's crash is on AI:CRASH;1273 CRASH.

    It broke at 137720.  Someone more knowledgeable than me should 
    probably look at it.  Incidentally, 137720 is nowhere near the
    TTY code, as nearly as I can tell.  Memory was acting flakey
    two hours before the crash.

This looks like an instruction failed to execute properly.  The system job
is trying to get rid of a running job in the mistaken impression that its
bit saying that it has done a .LOGOUT and should go away is set.  The bit
is not set and there is no sign that it has been.  (Possibly the job has
already gone away and this is a new job that somehow took its place, since
it looks like it is just starting up.)  There isn't any sign of register U
having been clobbered; it had the same value much earlier in SYSGUN when
DMNPLO was called.

If it was hot in the machine room at the time this crash occurred, it was
most likely a hardware failure.

        There's some bogosity here, but it isn't in ITS.  What you are
        complaining about is not a bug, but a feature. ... the error
        message you got meant that the system was full, and a job slot
        couldn't be found to load the job into.

    Well then the bogosity is that ITS is not smart enough to
    interpret the error that it gets when it can't find a job slot
    for a jobdev job.  I can hardly see that that is a feature.

I'm not sure what you mean by this.  If ITS weren't smart enough to
understand the condition that occurs when it can't find a job slot for
a jobdev job, it wouldn't give you an error message at all.  It would
just blow out.  As it happens, ITS generates a perfectly good error
message when it can't find a job slot for a jobdev job.  In fact, in
the cases you folks were reporting, DDT was even reporting the
condition to the user.  It IS a shame that the error message is the
same as that given when one attempts to write to a full pack.

If the AI lab had decided to continue using ITS, it would have been a
good thing to modernize some of the error messages.  At the time ITS
was first written, they were probably the most informative error
messages around.  Nowadays, however, we have operating systems like
Twenex that give you lowercase error messages, and nothing like the
functionality of job devices.  I can hardly see that this is a
feature.

There's some bogosity here, but it isn't in ITS.  What you are complaining

devices.  They are what allow you to access files on other machines, get a
pretty printout of the XGP queue, list your directory in various nice formats,
and all sorts of other nice things.

When you attempt to access a device whose name is not recognized by ITS, ITS
loads up a program called ATSIGN DEVICE, which searches for a file called
JOBDEV <device name> on the directory DEVICE;.  If it finds it, it loads it up
and runs it.  If it doesn't find it, it errors out.  However, the error message
you got meant that the system was full, and a job slot couldn't be found to

Subject:  OZ Shutdown
To: BUG-ITS at MIT-AI, BUG-OZ at MIT-AI, WIZARDS-OF-OZ at MIT-AI

Between friday night and saturday morning the following events
occured:

- One of the air conditioning package units began to put out   
  70 degree air (50 degrees is normal).

- AI began to get massive amounts of ECC errors. So many that the
  console could not keep up.

I called FIXIT to come and look at the A/C. They came and the
temperature went back down some.

At this point, with the help of RMS and RG I replaced defective chips
in the Stardust memory.

- Early Saturday morning OZ got a memory parity error and shut itself
  down. I am not certain this was caused by excessive heat.

- I decided that there was no point in leaving it powered on with the 
  air conditioning marginal, I powered down OZ.

-----------

What is being done about the A/C problem:

Physical plant claims that the air conditioning is "balanced" with the
idea that the major sources of heat on the 9th floor are ML and DM.
This was once true, and worked. it is no longer good enough.

I am preparing a map of the 9th floor so that they can redistribute
the A/C in a way that makes better sense. My map will be ready Monday
morning, and hopefully they can come in the same day.

-----------

What this means w.r.t. OZ coming up:

DEC may decide to start the 72 acceptance test again because of the
parity error. This could delay our getting the machine.

-----------

Opinion:

Since DEC has only taken 2 weeks so far, I am willing to be patient
and get things done right rather than risk losing AI by making too
fast a move.  

-----------

This is bothersome, but with all of the things that have gone right,
this minor setback is just that, minor.

News as it happens;

The DEBUG switch is *supposed* to be set in SYSBIN;NAME BIN, the output
of assembling NAME.  The file SYS;TS NAME, the output of purifying NAME,
is *not* the same file, does not contain the same stuff, and is not
supposed to have the debug switch set.  It also completely takes care of
installing itself when a new system is put in or it is moved from
machine to machine, as long as DEBUG isn't set to suppress that.

Did someone do something like copy SYSBIN;NAME BIN to SYS;TS NAME ?  It
seems like a real waste for someone (not me) to have gone to a lot of

FIND's JCL syntax is pulling a quick one on you.  "_" means "the thing

happened was this: FIND looked for all files that matched the pattern
SAV4 * on all directories on MC, and sent the output to SCHEME;FIND

of its time doing .OPENs, it looked like it was hanging in one .OPEN.

Small techincal point: The RFC for SUPDUP says that %TPCBS MUST
be on.  Indeed, ITS doesn't care , but other systems may.

So %TPMTA is ONLY used for hard wired terminals?  This is
unfortunate.  For purposes of modularity, I think that ITP should
only be a transport mechanism for 7, 8, or 12 bit characters and
know nothing of the character set it is transporting.  Once thee
character is assembled at the server, the server should look at
%TOFCI and %TPMTA (it doesn't make much sence for both to be on)
and do the system dependent things to the characters.

mumble... It's probaly not worth flaming about, since became an
issue in my terminal concentrator code, and it looks like I will
be using the 12.bit character set anyway...

    Suppose I have an AAA terminal that is capable of generating a
    META bit.  Suppose further that it is connected to a terminal
    concentrator that will talk SUPDUP to ITS.  Since it is SUPDUP, I
    am supposed to use the intelligent terminal protocol.  Therefore,
    the TTYOPT bits I think I should send include
	    %TOFCI  OFF  (can't do full character input)
	    %TPMTA  ON   (does have a hardware META bit)
	    %TPCBS  ON   (using ITP)

%TPMTA means that bit 7 is the meta bit.
You don't have to use ITP to be Supdup, but if you do use ITP you
have to send the 12-bit character set, not the 8-bit character set,
and thus you can't use %TPMTA.
Probably you want to have %TOFCI off but still send characters with
the %TXMTA bit.

    Now, sombody comes along and types META-A.  This has a code of
    301 (200+101).  Now as I understand it, ITP is only a mechanism
    for transmitting bytes, and does not assume the 5 bucky bits that

No.  ITS is a mechanism for inputting the internal ITS 12-bit character
set "directly" rather than going through the conversion from 8-bit
"ascii" characters.

			 Therefore when it gets reassembled on ITS,
    it gets assembled as 301.  This is fine until the TYI normalizer
    gets to it, and says, "Oh, this is %TXCTL+A" and converts it into
    a ^A.  Well, does that mean I should change a 301 into a 1101
    (%TXMTA+A) before sending it?  NOW, how does EMACS handle this?
    If I connected by a modem and sent META-A, would ITS convert this
    from 301 into 1101 when it puts it in the input buffer?  What is
    the consistent model?  How does EMACS deal with this?  and Should
    the TYI 7-bit normalizer look at %TOFCI before it goes around
    looking for TOP, CONTROL and META bits? 
EMACS doesn't handle any of this.  It sees only the 12-bit character set.

Hmmm, in the middle of RMAIL typing out some text onto the screen,
it stopped typing. I waited a minute or so but it didn't continue, so
I tried to close network connection but it didn't close, so I RESET the
TIP port and reconnected, but upon attaching to my detached tree after
connect TTYAC4+4>> typed out something about can't get the TTY (which
got overprinted by BUG when I backspaced and it decided to put the cursor
where it should be instead of where it had been) and then entered that
breakpoint (which is also now overtyped). I guess I'll see now if
I can continue my RMAIL any.

Suppose I have an AAA terminal that is capable of generating a
META bit.  Suppose further that it is connected to a terminal
concentrator that will talk SUPDUP to ITS.  Since it is SUPDUP, I
am supposed to use the intelligent terminal protocol.  Therefore,
the TTYOPT bits I think I should send include
	%TOFCI  OFF  (can't do full character input)
	%TPMTA  ON   (does have a hardware META bit)
	%TPCBS  ON   (using ITP)
 
Now, sombody comes along and types META-A.  This has a code of
301 (200+101).  Now as I understand it, ITP is only a mechanism
for transmitting bytes, and does not assume the 5 bucky bits that
are part of %TOFCI.  Therefore when it gets reassembled on ITS,
it gets assembled as 301.  This is fine until the TYI normalizer
gets to it, and says, "Oh, this is %TXCTL+A" and converts it into
a ^A.  Well, does that mean I should change a 301 into a 1101

When the system is revived it often happens that the datapoint
controller gets wedged somehow.  The result is that VT52's and
such do not get the revived message, or if the system got reloaded
may not get the message saying the system is in operation.  (I
may be confused about that case.)  Lock's DPK command fixes things
if you manage to figure out that the system is in fact up
even though your VT52 or Ambassador behaves as if it weren't.
Is there some way a DPK could happen automatically when the
system is revived?

JFFL ac,E	Jump on Find Free LispMachine
skip if at least one free lisp machine matching some description

the value at E contains an AOBJN pointer.  The AOBJN pointer
points to ASCIZ strings in one of two forms:
	<building>-<room>  or CADR-<number>
The star convention is allowed for building and room.  It is not
allowed for the CADR number. 

ac is a pointer to a block of zero words followed by a non-zero
word which will receive an string of 7-bit characters (similar to
JCL passing).  It is suggested that the non-zero word be 1, which
will cause the string to be ASCIZ.  The string returned is a list
of rooms (without stars) or free machines separated by commas.

Example:

	move ac,freeLM
	JFFL ac,[-3,,[ [asciz /NE43-8**/]	;an 8th floor cadr

Upon reflection, I think you are probably being faked out by the fact
that when the system is brought up (on AI) the system job goes catatonic
for a minute or two trying to type out "ITS IN OPERATION" on all the
TK-10 terminals that aren't there.  Then after the available 1 or 2
job slots get used up, you can't create any jobs until the system job
comes back and processes the request to create more job slots.  The
right solution to this is to reassemble the system with TK10P turned
off; unfortunately this will renumber all the terminals, and absolute
tty numbers are known in several places.  NAMDRG knows the number of
the free-screen TV.  DMNSTR knows the number of the xgp console.  The
TTYTYP file knows the numbers of all the terminals; NAME and NAMDRG
read this in when purified or something.

I case anybody cares, the reason MC was down memory 200-577 was
that the AMPEX start address switches were set wrong.  My theory
is that when DEC Field Circus re-enabled sector 0 a finger kept
going in the up-right direction and flipped the address switch.
There is now a piece of paper on the inside of the AMPEX door
wich gives a correct setting of the switches.

Another Output-Reset related gripe:

when output characters reach the level where flow control happens,
they are no longer flushable.  This means that during a long listing
I can type ^S (knowing that DDT will eventually shut up ten-twenty
lines later) and before output stops I can use the intelligent
terminal protocol to stop and start output several times, bacause
response speed to flow control is an order of magnitude better
than the response to ^S.

If multi-character %td sequences were forbidden argument bytes >177 then
%tdors would behave more like a genuine out-of-band signal, and maybe
that would make it permissible to flush a buffer without knowing about
multi-character sequences.  Of course this penalizes a (hypothetical?)
user with lines of 128 or longer in favor of a user with slow connection,
but does anyone really want 128. characters on a line?

When %TOMVU isn't set, thus the terminal needs to know where it's

may send it in other circurmstances as well.

I can understand why (SYSTEM;ITS)NATTAC calls

allow 400000+ttynum but ATTYC8 does (that is the only difference
between the routines).

I did a little poking around and found the following:

There is a mojor difference between TS3TTY 301 and TS#TTY 305.
The majority of the difference seems to be in the ATTY** routines
(the ones that determine if you have the TTY and whether you
should wait for it). 

I tried the the following:
	a^K
	factor(ratsimp((x+y)^12));
	^Z ^P
now I typed RETURN several times (say 20). After the 10th I got
the message  JOB A WANTS THE TTY.  Macsyma wanted to SIOT.  I
looked at the siot string and it contained %TDMV1 codes among
other things.  When you <alt>P the macsyma you will see that the
cursor goes to just above the JOB A WANTS THE TTY message, NOT
where you left off and NOT where you happened to be.

The culprit:
	RCPOS (Read cursor pos).  In the rearrangement of the
ATTY** routines it appears RCPOS has been changed to allow you to
read the cursor even when you don't have the tty (it used to wait
for the TTY).  Unfortunately, MACSYMA uses this information to
compute %TD codes.

On about 10/29/81 I noticed that MACSYMA was misbehaving when it was 
$Ped after having been ^Zed and ^Ped.  Namely the cursorpos calculation 
was off and it displayed the next expression one or two rows too high.
Just now I showed it to RWK, and as we suspected it was an ITS (TS3TTY) 
problem, we transferred the MACSYMA over to ML which is running an older
ITS (#1230 as opposed to #1244) and tried the same experiment there where 
it ran fine.  The difference was that you get the interrupt for 
"Job wants the TTY" at an earlier point on ML than on MC, namely at 
CRSRP1+4>>.CALL RCPOS (which presumably does the necessary cursorpos 
recalculation) rather than at IFORCE+11>>.CALL SIOT  .  If it is 
relevant, I am on a VT52.  Also, the thing I ask MACSYMA to do is 
FACTOR(RATSIMP((X+Y)^20));  which just uses up some time, so while 
it is computing, I ^Z ^P , and $P when it says "Job wants the TTY".
(Sorry I am so verbose, but I wanted to make sure I included whatever 
info may be necessary.)

Why does SCML cause an error when it tries to set the echo area
and it does not have the TTY?  :CALL SCML does not say there are
any errors for this system call.  In fact, the routine ASCML in
SYSTEM;TS3TTY puts the echo area in a magic field with
	DPB B,[$TBECL,,TTYTBL(U)]
Which I guess will get put in the right place when
the job gets .DTTY'd.  But after the DBP it does a POPJ P,
causing an error instead of
	AOS (P)
	POPJ P,
which would appear to be the right thing.

To: (BUG ITS) at MIT-MC
ITS 1243, which has been installed on MC for a week or so now, does its
crashing differently.  Most halts (JRST 4,.) have been replaced with
the new BUG macro, which types a message and goes to DDT.  Documentation
on this macro may be found in the source, where it is defined, near the
front of ITS >.  The BUG macro also replaces the SYSMSG facility.

When this system is installed on other machines, it would be a good idea
to install a new non-timesharing DDT along with it.  Assemble MC:SYSTEM;DDT.
The only change is to enable the feature of typing <alt>P to revive the
system from a non-fatal error to work.  Also install MC:SYS:TS SYSMSG when
and where the new system is installed.

This is not actually true.  The time when ITS does not bring it back
up is when it goes down several times in rapid succession (within
30 seconds I think), after which it decides that it must be broken
and leaves it down.

perhaps a power surge or static electricity turned off the PI system or

In the past couple of weeks, I've noticed that --more-- breaks have done some
unusual things.  I don't remembere then doing this before, but I'm not sure.

Just now, a proceeded job tried to print out something, while my hactrn was in
the middle of printing a page (of mail, read with ).  When the --more--
appeared, it acted as if it got a space immediately and went to the next page.

This was just now on a Vt52 on mc.  Last week, I was using a dissapoint over a
dialup, and every CLI interrupt would cause --more-- to flush.  This may be the
disappoint being random, but it didn't happen any other time.

 seems to have a problem with --more--, too.  A couple of times I've typed 
while in the middle of a page and gotten "--more--flushed
" printed out.  This was on a dialup.

gotten sufficiently excited about it to grovel through the ITS
file directory code, though.  (I think it was a major triumph
when it was reorganized so that directories were kept sorted instead
of re-sorting each time one was opened in ASCII mode; and another
when directory GC was grossly sped up so it didn't take time
n^3.  I doubt the code has been touched in ten years except for those
(actually, it probably has, but not significantly).)

	DSK:FOO; BAR PRESS

	DSK:FOO; BAR UNFASL

Then file lookup (for read) should work as:

Subject: Ten/11 Interface seems to be flakey (so, what else is new?)
To: BUG-ITS at MIT-AI
cc: CSTACY at MIT-AI

About midnight, AI stopped with a parity error. When CONTinued,it
would halt again. During this time, the door buzzer was stuck on. 

Cycling the PDP-11 got the door to stop being noisy.
However, I could not get the TVs work on ITS again.

While I was scratching my head, ITS crashed at CHACK1+14.
This is in some CORE code, and the error had something
to do with a pointer to a non-existant luser.

About now, I decided things were probably screwed up enough to
want to reload and try again.  Reloaded. 
When I ran SALVAGER, it found directories out of phase.   
I copied the most recent version to the other packs. This
worked and ITS came back up.

Later, when no one was logged in, I tried to make the system lose
by buzzing the door from a LISPM. ITS halted.

The job which got the parity error was a chaos DOOR server. It was
halted at FROBIT+1, a .SLEEP which comes immediately after an
access to the TEN11 interface.

Since the TEN/11 interface seems pretty broken, I deleted the DOOR
server from the DEVICE directory and put up a system message.

good idea for CRTSTY to set that value to zero (or whatever is

is ITS's responsibility to set it to zero when the sty gets

My XX job became hung permanently in CHAOSO because its CHSNOS was 0.
The net appeared to be working; I was able to make new connections

The "flag" was 20003.  Ibf, Pbf and Ack were 0; both window sizes were 5.

At the time the problem began, the fair share moved up to 120% and stayed
there for several updates of the who line.  Then it came back to a
legitimate value.

The problem was worse because this happened with SUPDUP at interrupt level
and it would not recognize Break.

Re:   jobdev / ITS bug, I guess

As best as I can determine, the system crashed doing a JOBRET for your JOB.07
returning whatever to your job FOO. At the point of the crash, the system
is hacking FOO on behalf of JOB.07, and hence requires that FOO be (internally)
stopped.  But FOO was not stopped, which is ostensibly an impossible condition,
do it halted.  I randomly tried continuing at the location after the check,
guessing that only FOO or JOB.07 would be screwed, but I didn't understand
the clock interrupt level logic the system was up to, so it couldn't continue.
I suggest that you try to recover as best you can the circumstances of what
you were doing and the state of the code, and ship it off along with your
munging of this note to BUG-ITS.

I looked around for people, and DLA told me that he knew that RG
was not here.

I halted it, and looked at where it halted.  It seemed to be
multiplying some numbers that it got from the TCMXV variable
of tty 40.

I printed out all the ac's, and some tty variables of tty 40 and
near ttys.  Now that I think of it, the routine ended in a popj,
so I guess I should have looked back up the stack to see who called
it and try to see if there was something else important that I could
record about its looping, but I didn't.

I booted it.

AI halted at this location at noon today.  I tried to record
as many significant-looking locations as I could on the console.
It seemed to be that something it expected to be in some saved ac's
somewhere wasn't there.

I waited about 30 minutes before rebooting.  I looked around
and found PDL on dm, but he didn't answer.  I paged RG, but he
wasn't around.

I noticed that RWK had dumped a crash on ai a while back, so I tried
to dump it (since it appeared to be a software problem, as opposed to
the random interrupt yesterday).  I tried to find out how much
free space there was from dskdmp, but couldn't.

I forgot about the memory off being in the low memory, and dskdmp
got an nxm trying to dump.

At this point I wasn't sure if dskdmp was clobbered, so I was going
to reload it from tape when rg showed up and said it was ok just
to restart it.

There is a little information in the log, but most is on the
console.

    Darn.  If you type ahead while in an editor (emacs/rmail) while a SEND is
    being typed on your screen, ITS doesn't buffer your input, so yo lose it.
    That means if you're in the middle of typing something and you get a
    flurry of SENDs or one long SEND you HAVE TO stop what you are doing
    until the SENDs are finished, then try to remember what you were doing
    after you've lost your train of thought.  You can't evn finish the
    sentence you are in themiddle of before stopping to look at the SENDs.

This is not true.

However, it is unfortunately true that if you type a control-G during
the printing of a SEND, the control-G will abort out of that printing,
rather than being passed to the program.  It is also true that characters
which are intended to interrupt the program you were typing to will not
cause an interrupt, but will be read as normal interrupt.  This is a DDT
problem that may or may not be possible to fix.

There appears to be a problem in the program that is run when

the user for his/her Uname, real name, address, and reason for wanting
an account just fine. Unfortunately after it does that it prints
a ")" followed by a carriage return and just hangs there. A CTRL-G
gets one out of that state (and back to DDT), but, unfortunately, it
also looses all the information that the potential user just
entered. 

I watch a potential new tourist do this a couple of times in a row

    There has long been a problem whereby every so often
    a TV gets hung, but gunning or detaching its tree unhangs it.

When I have looked, the cause has always been that the 10/11 interface
spazzed writing into the 11, and so there is a -1 at the place where the
11 thinks the next character from the 10 will come, so the 11 never
processes any more characters.  Since the 10 is careful never to wrap
completely around the buffer, it never comes back and writes over that -1
again, so it stays there forever.  Detaching resets everyone's buffer pointers.

    Today, several TVs were hung and the usual fix did not unhang them.
    I discovered that they were hung becaue their TTOALC words
    contained 100 instead of the -1 that they should have contained.

I hope this was due to the heat.

I was trying to transfer a file from AI to MC earlier tonight, and the
connection appeared to freeze.  I got the ITS prompt again, but the
file was marked locked (according to FIND) and PEEK C shows it with a
J next to it.

Eventually the file became unlocked, and included both the original
file and many replications of some random cruft from elsewhere on the
disk.  Apparently the ^C was missed, and far more was transferred than
intended.

The file is MC:GUEST1;FONER LOSSAG.  Past around 47% of the way
through starts the peculiar lossage I've described.  Might this have
something to do with AI's IMP flakiness, or is this a genuine problem
with ITS or FTP or whatever really does the transfer?

I don't need an answer for this, really, since I can just retry the
transfer.  But it should probably be reported in case it's part of a
consistent pattern of garbling.

AI has been turning on random high-order bits when it outputs accross

CHAOSnet (it happened when I TELNETted from MC to AI, if that helps),
but it certainly happens over the ARPAnet.  It is usually the 100
(octal) bit (spaces turning into tildes is the most common symptom), but
sometimes it is the 200 bit, often turning alphabetics into invalid %TD

David, thanks for the bit-level bug report.  But as far as getting things 
done on Sunday goes, don't bother.  The NCC nose that the IMP picks bits
on occasion, that it does so neither at 16 nor 36 (nor any other obvious 
word-length type number) bit intervals, and there is a repair visit 
already scheduled:

Tomorrow (Monday) at 0700 or so I will detach AI's IMP cable and install
a loopback, someone from BBN field service will arrive and repair the
IMP, and only when the IMP runs its own diagnostics will they try anything
with AI back on the net.  I certainly agree there is no reason to touch
ML's IMP cable, or even look crosseyed at it.

Past history:  On Thursday TY took off AI's IMP cable (at the NCC's request)
and they found the problem while running diagnostics.  Apparently the fault
showed up so fast that there was no reason to keep AI off the net for more
than a few minutes - hence virtually no interruption to users.  
	This time the repair procedure may take a few hours/days/millenia/
minutes, and since the IMP will be powered down to change cards, that means
the other IMP 6 hosts will be off the net, as stated in .MSGS.;ARPA DOWN.

[Note for NCC people - the specific errors David Moon spotted are:
	Bits with octal weights 10 and 4 get picked (spurious one). 
	Bit with octal weight 10 gets dropped (spurious zero).
		There may be additional problems.]

The problems are in the IMP, not in AI, as can be demonstrated by plugging ML
into AI's IMP port.  Please do not try this experiment yourself!  It took
me over an hour to get ML to work again on its own port after doing this,
because the connectors are quite literally falling apart.  And each time
they are plugged and unplugged they get worse.

The problems with the IMP, in terms of its 16-bit words, are at least the
following.  It's a little hard to tell but I think there may be problems
with some other bits as well (actually I am fairly sure):
Bits with octal weights 10 and 4 get picked (spurious one).
Bit with octal weight 10 gets dropped (spurious zero).

I will try and call up the NCC tomorrow about this, during the daytime, but
it wouldn't hurt for anyone else who is around during the day to call them
first.  The number is 661-0100 and you need to convince them to give you a

The STATUS protocol does not accept arguments.  The ITS server for it

The number of bytes of arguments is irrelevant.  If you wait long enough

I'm telneting from LLL-S1 to AI and I find that on output a large
number of characters output have their bits modified.  In particular,
a large number os spaces have turned into "`"s, i.e. the 100 bit got
turned on.  Also, I've seen ">" turn into "~", ":" into "z", and other
weird things.  This isn't happening to other hosts.

To: BUG-ITS at MIT-MC

The same thing happened to me recently.

There are some tourists on ai who have written this hack which
runs as a disowned job and periodically sends random messages
to the hackee.  [Message from your Terminal]...

Someone tried to do this to me, but the program seems not to
work quite right, or something.  It left me in CLOBI.  I killed
the job and it went away.  I don't know that this is the same thing.

Right now when I try to send to ellen, my hactrn hangs at
the place where it is waiting to send.  I do not know what
failure code the open returned, because she had logged out
by the time I tried to do it again, and the register had
been trashed.  But since it was looping, it must have
been %EFLDIR or %ENAFL.

Her old, bad hactrn was trying to read from CLO: _CLI_;ELLEN HACTRN,
and had it open in .BAI.  I guess this is why my sends to her didn't
work, even though the hactrn which was trying to send to itself
became HACTRO.  That doesn't seem quite right, though.

HCLOB was 0 and HHACK was -1.  I'm not sure why her hactrn was
trying to open itself.

In the process of trying to look back up the stack to see
who had opened this,  I managed to trash the job.  I did a
CTYPE 41 X that I meant to do in another job in the hactro,
and of course trashed it.  It dumped itself, but I doubt that's
of any use.

It was trying to do a .IOT on it at FDRCO4, having been called
at FDRCO1+3.  I didn't get any farther.

Three times in succession tonight I have control-Z'd out of an EMACS and
had my DDT hang, typing control-G had no effect.  Typing echoed but
$$V or other commands had no effect.  Upon hanging up (I am on a dialup
line) and reconnecting, leaving my tree detached, I find on looking at
a peek that my HACTRO is in state "*CLOBI" and it says "CLI"
to the right of the "Time PIs" column.  This has not happened to me from
anyplace except exiting EMACS, however the EMACS job appears unaffected,
as I can snarf it from the HACTRO and continue using it.

    the wrong thing.
The problem was undoubtedly that there were no free job slots and therefore
server processes could not be created.  The STATUS response is generated
directly by the system rather than by a server process, for exactly this
reason: so that it will always work if the system is up, even when it is
overloaded.

This could be all in my head, but I noticed two clobberages today that
struck me as a little strange:

The end of SK;SK OBABYL appears to have some lines missing from the
last message.

SK;PASCAL LISP seems to be missing (or transpose and missing)
characters at the end.  You can read this file and see for yourself
(it's only about 10 lines long).  If comparision with the tape dump
(Tape 325, file #95) shows a discrepancy, we are all in a lot of
trouble (since ITS says, and I agree, that the file hasn't been
modified in any normal way since it was dumped).

I could be imagining all this and could have accidently clobbered these files
myself.  I thought I'd bring it up just to be on the safe side.

To: (BUG ITS) at MIT-MC
The recent MC crash where the system died trying to gun a garbage job
tree for me may be even more related to me than that.  

Earlier that evening I discovered that the .getsys uuo was acting
strangely (never mind WHY I discovered that).  It seems that it no
longer works for some of the random sixbit keywords you can give it
(for example: DEVS and NCALLS work, but GETS doesn't (!)).  In the
cases where it doesn't work it has a tendency to trash the two
accumulators involved (aobjn pointer and sixbit key).

Now, I was just going to ignore this all, figuring that nobody uses
the thing anyway, but after talking with Moon it sounds like one of
the garbaged words in the job in question was trashed with one of MY
aobjn pointers from a failing .getsys!

Perhaps it is worth someone's time to look into this.

^S'ing the "welcome" message would hang my terminal.  This happened
consistently.  Up till today, I have had no problems ^Sing the message

Also, typing Q in peek while it attempted to typeout caused me to
hang.

Reowning the detached tree did not make things work (still dead) in

In any case, I think I had to close and re-open the connection about 5

	I've been saying that the likelihood of a T-300 control

I only saw that break once, and then it was a matter of switches
wrong, and not anything broken. So saying that the T-300's are
less reliable on those grounds isn't indicated. I have said
that I thought that the reap path ought to have SECOND: somewhere

Hmm, now that I think about it you're right; but I didn't even notice it.
Clearly my analysis is wrong. The reason I think it is better to have a
Trident be SECOND: (ie. be first to be reaped to) because when a Trident
goes down you get the choice of which Trident you want to leave down.
When pack 13 goes down the way things work now, it is the most recently
modified files that must go away.  With the other scheme there is one,
posible two whole packs of data more recent than the one lost.

I think by this time it ought to be clear to all that the likelihood of one
of the RP04's being down probably far exceeds the likelihood of one of the
Trident's being down.  Therefore I don't understand why it is still first
in the migration path.  One could perhaps argue that the Tridents might be
less reliable since a failure of any item in the chain of hardware
connecting the Tridents can bring them both down (DL10, I/O 11, Century
controller), I might suggest that considering the percentage of storage
those devices represent, the system will effectively be useless to most
users anyway.  Therefore I think the only relevant probability to consider
is one Trident drive vs one RP04 going down, and I think its obvious which
is the more reliable of the two.

   Within a day or two of the reappearance of these files I can
flush them all again and free up several directories.

This is caused by a bug in ITS, such that SIOT does not work properly
when reading a binary directory.  MLSLV notices the bug while most
other programs do not, since it tries to read past the end of the
directory.  The bug is fixed in the source (ITS 1216); as a byproduct
the operation will be much faster.  I guess I (or someone) should
install this system on ML soon.  (The Chaosnet is currently broken in
the source, but ML doesn't have a Chaosnet, and only hosts without a
Chaosnet cause the original symptom of the complaint from the Lisp
machine.)

There must also be a bug in the Lisp machine, that it dies so foully
when it gets back an ISE0 error from a DIRECTORY operation (the real
error is a CHNL NOT OPEN IOC error from the SIOT that is slurping in

    Isn't it supposed to say PACK NOT MOUNTED instead of undefined
    device?

It does for SECOND:, because knowledge of that pack was wired in before
the more general scheme was adopted.  THIRD:, FOURTH:, VISION:, etc. are
known from the name stored in the TUT on the disk, so ITS doesn't know
anything about the pack at all if it's not mounted.  Maybe this info
wants to be included in the CONFIG file as well.

    fine for me.  But, when another tries to emulate a DM2500 and uses the

I explained the problem in detail.  The documentation in KSC;DM2500 DOC is
correct for a real Datamedia.  Your DM3025A does not work the same way.
You like the way it works better, great, tell your friend to make

These were due to the wrong port being enabled on the ARM-10 (the port
for the DL10 wasn't on).  This has been rectified.

This affected mapping of pages from THIRD: and FOURTH: into memory.  Read-only
pages were not damaged, read/write pages were written back as zero.

*  If you had EMACS libraries that stopped working, they should work now.
*  If you had a program residing on THIRD: or FOURTH: that stopped working,

Today I noticed several unusual effects which affected Emacs, but which I 
attribute to ITS or hardware lossage.

A dumped Emacs which I had and for which no files it depended on had changed
suddenly stopped working.

Doing M-X Load LibraryVT52 loaded the SAFETY library for half the afternoon
in any version of Emacs. ECC and I both looked at this and were kinda confused.
:PRINT showed EMACS;VT52 :EJ was really not the SAFETY library, so something
was off.

Later I was going to show EB how M-X Load LibraryVT52 was losing, but it said
that the file was not in library format. This is wierd because it had still not
been altered (since March, 1980).

I just renamed EMACS;VT52 :EJ to EMACS;VT52 O:EJ and copied in 
EMACS;VT52 :EJ and suddenly my dumped Emacs is working again.
M-X Load LibraryVT52 is now working also. A binary comparison of these files
(I opened them in fixnum mode in lisp and did a word-by-word comparison) shows
that they are identical and doing M-X Load LibraryEMACS;VT52 O:EJ now wins.

I am wondering what kind of lossage could have caused this problem. Any
ideas? Maybe the directory was somehow inconsistent?

Unfortunately, a real Datamedia will very easily drop out of roll mode.
Exiting Insert/Delete mode (^X) will also exit roll mode.  On some
models apparently a Master Reset command (^_) will also exit roll mode.

In order to actually use Datamedia hardware scroll features it would be
necessary to always follow each of these commands with an enter roll mode.
This would probably work for TCTYP support.  The reason CRTSTY does not
use this method is because it allows the use of all 80 columns on the
terminal (if a terminal autowraps the way a Datamedia does, you cannot use
the last column with TCTYP support).  If the terminal were to operate in
roll mode all the time, but the ITS user had asked for wrap mode (the
default, as opposed to scroll mode), and were to output a character in the
last column of the last line, the terminal would auto-newline and scroll
irretrievably losing the top line of the screen before CRTSTY could do
anything to compensate.  In fact there would be no way CRTSTY could safely
put a character in that position, short of temporarily exiting roll mode.
I guess it seemed easier to implement scrolling with delete line.

I forgot to say in my previous message that by default ITS will never scroll

scrolling say :TCTYP SCROLL and then output from most programs will be scrolled.

ITS sends ^M ^J ^W when it wants to go to the next line, which should
scroll if given on the bottom line.  Real datamedias ignore the ^J in this
circumstance, but ITS sends it anyway for the benefit of some simulated
datamedias.  ^W is erase-to-end-of-line of course.

Maybe CRTSTY doesn't send the ^J?

ITS assumes that roll mode is on and that you have set the line length short
enough that the hopeless auto-nl misfeature does not get invoked.  The :tctyp
command does both of these I believe.  You should not implement auto-nl and
not implement lack of roll mode.  What you should do is handle ^M by going
to start of same line, ^J by going down a line and scrolling if that would take
you off the bottom of the screen, both of these unconditionally.  That will
work with ITS but perhaps not with some other programs such as CRTSTY and
WAITS that claim to know about datamedias.  It will also work with TECO
on Tenex and TOPS-20.

This means one of two things.  One is that it may have already been
deleted, but not yet removed from the directory because someone is
reading it (such as RMAIL).  The other possibility, which isn't likely

Ron is using the documentation found in KSC;DM2500 DOC and GZ's DM2500
emulation code for use on a TRS-80 to emulate a DM2500 on his micro
and it seems that there is a difference in how a DM2500 is scrolled
using TCTYP vs CRTSTY.  (Now, I know there is, but my terminal
emulates a DM2500 too, and I don't use CRTSTY, and it scrolls alright
for me.)  Is there a difference between the description of a DM2500 in
that file and the ITS implementation as far as how scrolling is
handled?  The reason I ask is that I disagree with Ron and believe
that the way ITS does is right and CRTSTY does it awkwardly (nad takes
up an unnecessary job slot in the process.  --Frank

Re:   DM2500

  Frank, I still have problems with the DM2500 when I'm not using
CRTSTY.  The only time I can get a screen scroll is when I'm in
CRTSTY, and it does a scroll by going to top line and issuing a
delete, then going back to bottom line.  Is it possible to have
the "natural" DM2500 (whatever *that* is) do this?

    Our link from edinburgh to MIT is very complex, going thourgh

    This is then extremely unreliable. very often we get cut
    off by a failure over here, and can't get back to close

    but results in us staying logged in when we don't exist.
    I talso seems that these crashes always take place just before

    Could it be clever and discover we were in MAIL and send the

Two or three people at other sites have communicated with me about this.
Apparently not even TOPS-20 actually has working TCP protocols (neither telnet,
nor FTP, nor mail).  The concensus seems to be that the change cannot possibly
happen on most sites by 1983, and hopefully the sites can convince the sponsors to
convince the network management accordingly.  We are not alone in not having
the manpower to make this sort of complex and unnecessary change, it would appear.

This is a non-trivial change.  If we are to do it, it will require
approximately one man-year of highly-skilled system programming,
possibly more, and it is unlikely that I will be available for this.  If
I were you, I would start communicating with the sponsors and inform
them that it will be impossible to meet this deadline without extra
funding to hire someone to do it.  I expect that most other hosts that
don't run TOPS-20/TENEX nor Multics are in the same boat.

By the way, unlike the 96-bit leader change which we did 2 or 3 years
ago, this change is of absolutely no benefit to us (unless it really is
enforced, in which case it "benefits" us by allowing us to continue to
use the Arpanet).  The DOD Standard protocols (Internet and TCP) provide
the same functionality as the existing protocols, except with the details
all changed around, and with some additional functionality for AUTODIN II
which is not of much interest to us.

a patch in to take out some of the change; did the patch get lost
or is it failing in the presence of the patch?

The changes to the code had to do with deciding when the net was up and
when it was down, and fixed problems where the system would crash if
it went up and down too rapidly.

Maybe you could look at a source compare of the old and new IMP and

.PAGAHEAD is zero, which should mean that the feature is
disabled.  A word search sdoesn't show any .SUSET for turning

In ITS 1198 (on DM), and ITS 1207 (MC), .pagahd and .pagrange have the
amusing property that they are not reset by killing the job they are set
in.  Thus, if I get job 3, set those variables, and kill it, whoever
gets job 3 next will end up with them set.
The bug PDL reported about the death of inqupd on DM seems to be related
to its use of page-ahead:  when we patched out all the appropriate
susets, it ran to completion.  RWK, could this be the cause of your
problems with it on MC?
DM has been exhibiting rather entertaining behavior with respect to the
NSWPGS user variable:  jobs with page-ahead set (due to the leftover
.pagahd and .pagrange from old inqupds) get negative nswpgs with
high frequency.  We've also been observing reasonably random behavior
in certain jobs, perhaps caused by their pages being swapped in at
the wrong place?

That is, for example, I begin typing a command and the realize that it should
have had a colon before it.  If I backspace (rubout) to the beginning and
enter the colon then retype the command it does not realize that the colon
is there and errors saying "you must type a colon..."

To: (BUG ITS) at MIT-MC
In response to RWK's testing of the H19 line insert/delete padding, I have
raised it a little bit in the source.  I probably rounded down where I
should have rounded up in calculating it.  I went to patch it in the running
system on MC, and found a highly ridiculous value of 5 ms of padding per line
moved there.  (I am raising the value from .625 ms per line moved to .75).
Please tell me that this 5ms value is totally random.  If its true, it is not
consistent with other programs which use 18 ms net for each line isnet/delete
done.  I have left the 5ms figure pending clarification.

In the grand tradition of TS3TTY kludges, I have put entries for char
insert/delete in for the C100.  In order to put the the null needed to exit
char insert in the ASCIZ string, I have resorted to 8 bit characters and
used a 200.  As best as I can tell this will be loaded as 8 bits and
deposited as 7 on a Morton and then be caught at the apropriate level
and turned into the kludge thats needed to get a null out on a Morton.
However, if I'm wrong there are two other possible results:
  1) Use of char insert on a C100 on a Morton will result in never
     exiting char insert mode.  This would probably result in rather
     random screen lossage.
  2) It will crash ML? (Does DM have Morton also?)

Whoever brings up the next ITS on these machines should probably test
this immediately to make sure option 2 does not result.  Note that %TOCID
will not be turned on by default for :TCTYP C100 since char insert/delete
only works on new microcode C100s.  If you have an old microcode C100 you
should mail someone like me a set of 4 or 5 2716s depending on whether
you also want a Sail character Prom for the 2nd charset slot.

I've just brought up the new ITS on MC.  It seems to be
OK except for a few minor problems:

The padding on H19's for I/D line doesn't seem to work
right in some circumstances.  I'm not sure what's going
on, but it fails whenever EMACS recomputes the window,
resulting in ^S^Q lossage.  But it always seems to work
when I Insert or delete any number of lines manually.

The LNKEDP system call always gives WRONG TYPE DEVICE.
It's not immediately obvious to me just why, from
looking at the source.  (BTW, this was put in the
wrong place, effectivly removing the LOAD system
call by screwing the binary search).  Anyway,
MC is about to go down for PM, so I'll leave this
for later.  As near as I can tell, page-ahead is
winning, or at least isn't causing the system to
lose.  But I haven't tried it on a very loaded system

    :TCTYP H19 would actually be useful if ITS would pad the ins/del line

You message makes no sense, but I implemented it anyway.  I don't think
the H19 is 17ms PER line inserted or deleted, and I don't see why it only
takes 8.5ms if the UART is running at 4800 baud.  I implemented a padding

To: (BUG ITS) at MIT-AI

This is really weird; I must be overlooking something simple.

When I connect to any ITS from DCECTIP or PENTIP (which are the
only ones I tried), funny things happen to my connection.
These funny things are consistant, and do not happen when I
use this same terminal/modem (300bd,btw) on non-net systems,
or on a Unix I tried which is on the net. These funny things
also do not happen on an AI Dialup.

The funny things:  the system pases in the middle of the SSTATUS
and hangs for a few secs, sometimes I have to control-G out to
pword toplevel.

Various characters are received and echoed wrong. When I first
saw this I thought that my terminal or modem was dropping bits,
but it is now clear that the problem only occurs connecting to
an ITS over a TIP.  To wit,
s := ^S
n := ^N  but N:=N
a := ^A
space := nothing? (sounds like its xmitting it, but no echo)
atsign := same as space


I cant imagine whats wrong.  Help?

Thanks,
Chris

    Date: 7 February 1981 00:52-EST
    From: Earl A. Killian <EAK at MIT-MC>

    The C100 would probably work fairly well on ITS without using
    CRTSTY, just as it does on XX.  This is to say that while it is
    completely trivial to construct legitimate sequences of requests
    to the virtual terminal support that will lose, those sequences
    don't tend to come up while editing in EMACS.  With CRTSTY,
    however, it is extremely common for CRTSTY to produce such
    sequences as the result of other unrelated optimizations that it
    is doing.  As a result CRTSTY definitely cannot use insert/delete
    character unless your terminal supports the set blank
    characteristics and set insert mode commands.  On ITS it's not so
    clear, but I think having the default be off is still the right
    thing; users with the proper microcode or bravery can always try
    :TCTYP +%TOCID (I hope this works).

:TCTYP +%TOCID does not work, in the sense that ITS has no entries for
char ins/del on a C100 whether on by default or not.  I was going to
put entries in, but unfortunately, the C100 uses Escape-Null to exit
insert mode.  I can't put the null in an ASCIZ string which is what
the table entries consist of, and I don't know TS3TTY well enough
to figure out a good kludge..

Subject: TS3TTY terminal padding
To: (BUG ITS) at MIT-MC, (BUG TERMINALS) at MIT-MC

Remember the feature to vary a terminal's line insert/delete padding in
proportion to the number of lines left to be moved on the screen?  Anyway,
it was never exercised in any terminal defintions.  EAK and I tried
patching the entry for a C100 with PADCR=1 on ML and found it seems to
work fine.  However, when calculating the values for a 1200 baud C100 or
for a Teleray 1061, we find that they would really want to be 1.7 and 2.5
milliseconds respectively.  Rounding 2.5 ms up to 3 ms makes a difference
of 12 ms (* 10 lines moved can get annoying).  Therefore in the fine
tradition of TS3TTY kludges, if the table entry is negative (which used to
mean the value given is milliseconds per line to be moved), then it is the
number of 1/8 milliseconds per line to be moved.

This is MC:SYSTEM;TS3TTY 271, I have updated the terminal entries for the
C100 and Teleray.  Good luck to the next ITS debugger, why am I so
verbose?

	What is the effect of linking to a free STY (i.e. Finger shows it as

    It depends on the state of the STY.  If you just link to an unused sty,
    you get a ?, since the tty you want to link to does not exist.  What
    must have happened is that the sty became unused after the link existed,
    as for instance if someone logs out from a sty and you link to him just
    before or after the logout (but before the net connection is closed.
    I believe that the system doesn't really do anything with stys whose
    only activity is a link, and they will vanish, breaking the link.
Actually, this isn't right at all.  You can link to a free sty, and
slave it, etc.  The fact that you have done so is recorded.  It doesn't
work very well, tho, since there isn't anybody on the other end of the
STY to gobble up it's output, so it quicly fills up it's output buffer
and can't print anything more.  FINGER's 'Sty not in use' merely means
that it is unowned.

Subject: bitten again
To: (BUG MAIL) at MIT-AI, (BUG ITS) at MIT-AI

comsat decided to take another walk over my mail file. today i logged in
and typed :rmail, and found myself looking at a message sent to alan and
bee. neither of whom i am. this was somewhat disconcerting, so i quit out
of the rmail and poked around a bit. by now the rmail had obligingly 
copied the contents of my mail file into my rmail file and had deleted the
mail file, so there was no way of finding out information about it. i have
copied the entire bunch of new mail (everything before the first message
that i know i have seen in rmail before; i use r-option append and gmsgs
so the break was pretty clearly after the newest system msg) to the file 
ai:vsdb;foo2 mail. i also looked at this stuff: i am sure that the first 
seven msgs are not for me, and that the eighth (which starts with gubbish
and turns into a news digest) probably is. evidence of when i was last seen
by the system is a file i wrote the last time i was logged in (i know i 
read my mail that time); the file was written at 03:38 on 2/1, and i logged
out within a few hours of that. the time of the first msg that is probably
mine AND has a readable time is 13:35 on 2/1. this is the ninth msg in
foo2 mail; the eighth msg (the news digest with gubbish at the front) does
not have a readable time. the news digest canonically comes out at 10:00
PST which means 13:00 EST, but the ostats file has been written to disk 15
(third:) which is currently unaccesssible due to dead disk drive, so i 
can't tell exactly when it came out on sunday or what msgs i got earlier 
that morning. however, given the several hours between these times, i think 
that comsat (or something) walked over the first several msgs sent to me
sunday morning and replaced them with the random stuff that is now the 
first seven msgs in foo2 mail.
dave moon says that since i logged out sunday morning ai has had problems
(disk drive losing causing locked blocks all over, and hic's memory losing
in some way (he wasn't sure of the details when he mentioned this) causing
programs to act in very random ways) either of which could have caused
the lossage i experienced here.
i guess i will have to wait until the third: pack comes back online before
i can see what i missed; i may not be able to get the stuff i lost back
because of the time delay here.

Presumably one could write a cross between FIDO and the SPY feature of LOCK
as follows:  have a program that runs as a demon (so it wakes up when
the system is brought up).  Once every couple of seconds it wakes up
and scans the system TTY tables for COM links much as PEEK might.
(Or JEDGAR -- this hack involves bits of sixteen other programs!)
When one is found, then it uses the SPY device to gobble the
characters and appenbd them to a file.  If you're hairy enough you
can transcribe several at once.
This is not an offer to write the hack -- I have no time.  I'm just outlining
the technical possibilities.  I will, however, remark that there may be
a difference of kind rather than degree between random spying on other
terminals and systematic transcription of people's conversations.  It
probably should not be done without at least a system message (which you
see whenever you log in) to the effect that such monitoring is in progress.

I just logged in from the net, and before my login init was thru,
I got a message from system overseer saying I did not look like an
authorized user. there are about 8 people on now, half are tourists.
I think this is a bug because if PWORD let me in at this time, the
overseer program should not say he doesn't recognize me. Anyway, i

Tell your friend to ask the UC Berkeley Comp Sci dept.  Their UNIX
systems have a talk program which, while a feeble imitation of ITS com
links (eg no multiple party links), is much easier to modify for
scripting, because it is a user program rather than part of the
operating system.  I suspect the patterns will be different (more
sophomoric dialogue, owing to thousands of freshlings) but why not
take advantage of a home-grown resource...

A friend of mine would like to do a study of language pattern in com-links
as a project for her class in Spoken/Written language differences.  (She
views com-links as a cross between the two.)  Is there any easy way to have
ITS record com-links somewhere for a week or two?  The person doing the study
is Nancy Levidow, a grad student in linguistics at UC Berkeley.  (I'm assuming
there are no privacy problems with this, as any comlink could be spied upon;
just technical problems.)  Easiest way to respond is via GNU@MC, since she's
not on the net.

    I just happened to have a peek today when one of those hangs happened...
    and by gosh and by golly, there were two full VT52 screens plus a few lines
    of disk channels in use from a C in peek.  I dunno... lots of TeX's and various
    INQUIRS (nasty Ellen here noting that some of the INQUIR channels were from
    unlogged lines doing WHOIS or NAME...).  Anyway, it probably was running out
    of disk channels.  How many are there?

Yes, exhausting the supply of disk channels is the usual cause of this.
There are a fairly humongous number I believe.  Maybe I should see if ITS
can be made to do something useful in this case.  (It used to return errors
instead of hanging, but someone decided it would be better to hang.)  Maybe
I can make it return an error after a while, which might encourage killing
of jobs.  TEX is a gross offender in this respect (so are PUB and COMPLR)
in that they open many channels, making a deadlock more likely.

There has been a very high incidence rate of jobs hanging for a long time
(rlb: `several tens of seconds') waiting to do i/o to the disk. Is it possible
that this is due to an ITS bug or is it more likely to be people using up all
the disk channels/buffers/?? If it's possible that it's the former, could 
someone look into it? It's extremely irritating and has almost caused us to
reload the system unnecessarily a couple times because disk i/o was unavailable
for so long (one or two times ITS just started working again just as we were
about to reload it; these were several-minute pauses) ...

Subject: Slight protocol change, and new MLDEV/MLSLV installed
To: info-mldev at MIT-AI

The MLSLV protocol has been upgraded in response to some catastrophes
that occurred on DM about 6 weeks ago.  Specifically, a number of files
on SYS directories were deleted using MLSLV, and because of the way the
protocol is constructed, there was no way to track down the culprit,
even thought the usual console message were written.

MLSLV has been extended by the addition of a LOGIN command and reply
code.  Logging in is REQUIRED only for deletion of files, but for
simplicity and friendliness, MLDEV starts a login (but does not wait for
the response) almost immediately.  This should not particularly slow
down the protocol.

Instead of logging in as hhhJuu (host and user) MLSLV, it now logs in as
XUNAME (of the foreign user) MLSLV, with a "terminal name" of hhhJuu.
It should still be easy to match up jobs, connections, etc., via PEEK,
and much easier to identify who is doing what.

If it is deemed necessary to de-install the new MLSLV and MLDEV, it was
installed using links:
	On each site, SYS;ATSIGN MLDEV is a link to SYS;ATSIGN NMLDEV,
	and SYS;ATSIGN OMLDEV is the old MLDEV.

	MLSLV is organized the same way, but lives in DEVICE;
Bugs can be sent to me.

Although this change is slightly incompatible, it should not prove to be
a real problem for users, or for upgrading of other programs using the
protocol.

This has also happened several times recently on ML, and ML's PWORD is
currently patched to disallow initiating links.  But better than this would be
to have ^_E not work on a not-logged-in dialup or STY (leaving local TTY's
alone).  This is a simple change to ITS, and minimizes the restrictions imposed
to achieve the goal.  If there are no objections I'm willing to do the

If you read the file .INFO.; ITS LOCKS it will tell you about features
for creating unique IDs and having locks that get unlocked when a job
is killed.  Of course there is no way to run arbitrary code when a job
is killed; that could easily make it impossible to kill.

It's easy to tell whether a given job "points to" a file, if you include
that job's job-number in the name of the file.  You simply have
one file per job-number, recreated when a job starts up.  If you
want to delete "left over" files in some cleanup procedure, simply
check to see if the job has the name of that file in a fixed place
in its memory (or we could allocate a new .OPTION bit or use the
dragon's way of telling whether a job is a Macsyma).

    Files that want to be sure to go away when a process is killed can be written

I've seen files on the so-called .TEMP. directory end up on
back-up tape! Look, theres one now on MC:.TEMP.;LPH .PLOT.

Each and every macsyma which starts up will probably create
a new file on the .TEMP. directory, and these will have
to be garbage collected better than they are now.
The problem is, how can a clean-up program tell if any existing
macsyma jobs point to one of the files? Well, I guess AGE greater than
8 hours is a reasonable heuristic. Does ITS have any thing which could
give a UNIQUE process ID over the time between crashes?

Is there any provision in ITS for letting a process take an
interrupt when something tries to KILL it? It could then
delete the file(s) and kill itself.

    		Noel
The reason is that logging in on ITS is not permitted (by ITS) if a job has
inferiors.  One way to avoid lossage is to log in before doing anything.
Of course, I think a better thing to do would be to allow logging in with
inferior jobs.  Since this is already done when a job is reowned, I wouldn't
think this would be very hard to do...

Isn't that marvelous?  All I really did after that today was send a

You see, my buddy the PDP-6 (T06) and I have a little contest going

type ^B to it. 80 blocks of USERS5;.PEEK. 1. Ahhh, but now I've logged in...

    Perhaps DDT and other programs should be using ECHOIN to solve
    the rubout problem (where ABD<rubout>CD echoes as ABDC instead of
    ABCD).  If the rubout problem is the only reason why :MAIL
    doesn't use PI echoing, then maybe it should use it too.

Unfortunately ECHOIN is rather difficult to use.  I designed a scheme 
which would not require any changes to user programs but I don't have
nearly enough time to implement it.  The basic idea is that when a non-echoing
character is typed the system defers echoing, and re-enables it when
the next echoing character is read by the program (in the meantime the
program may have typed out, for instance to echo erasure for a rubout).
This wouldn't be too hard but the refinement to it is to go ahead and echo
additional characters so you can see what you're typing, but if the program
types anything out erase that echoage and do it again, which is too hard
to do right now.  I don't suppose there are any competent volunteers?

I was running Babyl a little while ago and managed to get it into a wierd

After that, it was hard to tell if things were listening to me. I tried 'ing

console was listening to me -- just streams of random characters displaying
mostly. After a while, I noticed that the output I was seeing when I typed
something was mixed part of the stuff I should be seeing and part of the

Re:   BUG => crtsty

	I have a slight problem.  I own a microcomputer
system upon which I have simulated a superimage mode (SUPDUP?)
terminal, i.e. a terminal which would (in theory) take the 'raw'
output stream from ITS (escaped by 177s, as documented in INFO
somewhere) and do nice (and fast) things without the aid of a
front end preprocessor like CRTSTY.

	I have all of the escape sequences & so forth working (I have
tested them out in local mode....), but to date my efforts to get
ITS to beleive in my SUPDUP terminal have been fruitless, if not
unspectacular -- ITS will either ignore me completely and continue
to treat me as a printing terminal, or it will "blow up" and
start sending me wierd and wonderful, if useless, control characters.

	1) How do I get ITS to beleive in me?  What bits must I
twiddle in order to get the ITS buffer output codes to work for me?

	2) If I can't get ITS to send me the buffer codes, how can
I use CRTSTY's SOFT terminal emulator?  (Having looked
at the listing for the SOFT front end it seems that that is about
what I have written to emulate -- but I can't get SOFT to work either.)

	It would be preferable to just set bits in DDT and not have
to take up an extra job slot, of course.

	Please answer -- I am badly in need of some help here.

The system job deletes core link files which have not been referenced
for two minutes.  I do not believe that files which were opened as CLI:
(perhaps as opposed to CLO:) should go away if the jobs to which interrupts
were given still have those interrupts pending.  The effect of the current
practice is that a job which is ^Z'ed at the time it receives its CLI
interrupt may later get that interrupt but not be able to open CLA:.

Also, it would be nice if a channel open to CLO: could interrupt when
input became available....

ITS seems to be flakier these days about when it types a colon (when in
monitor mode).  Often after running a program it will type *, ^W,
or nothing, requiring you to hit CR to get your input interpreted as 
a command.  What has happened?  Can it be fixed to always provide a colon?
In particular, :TCTYP *never* provides any prompt except ^W, and as I recall,
never has.  This ought get fixed.  (Does anybody who works there use
:monmode?  I've heard it referred to as "crippled mode", but since I 
don't have an ITS manual handy ever, I can't remember the obscure

Why are half of the login and emacs init files in the world on pack 13?
I think this is a total loss.  I imagine if someone is on a vacation
or something, their whole directory gets put on pack 13, and they never
notice it until pack 13 crashes.  Can't this brain damaged dumping process
be made more clever?  The backlash from this is likely to be people
writing programs for their logout file that sets the don't reap bit
for all their files and copies them all to primary packs.  I spent half
the moring handling complaints from dozens of users who didn't understand
why none of their normal activities worked (login, emacs, mail, etc.).
I consider this to be a very serious lossage and hope steps can be taken
to make sure this doesn't happen again.  I suppose I can write a trival
program that fixes all directories after every dump, but it is a loss that
this should be necessary.

There are two seperate losses which are being confused here.
There are a finite number of entries in the system translation
table; if an attempt to create a translation (TRANAD) is done
a DIRECTORY FULL error message is generated.  This virtually
never happens, and clearly did not happen in this case.

If a translation gets chased more than 64 or so times, it is
deemed to be losing and the error TOO MANY TRANSLATIONS
is generated.  I think from CSTACY's message he did
 DSK:FOO;MUMBLE MUMBLE

He then did :PRINT MUMBLE MUMBLE and got the correct error

No bug, the total number of translations is a fixed constant on each ITS.
IN general you should not make a translation unless there is no other good
way to accomplish the objective and it is highly anti-social to have more

Closing another job's disk channel inside IODCL,
with U and P set up for that other job, got to QDEL11
which went to UUOTRO.  UUOTRO assumes that U and P are
set up to the job which is running.  So it called
ALOGOUT again which decided, since U was a which
had an inferior and 40 had .LOGOUT 1, to act like
a .BREAK.  Giving the interrupt eventually crashed
because it checked for LSWPR being nonzero.
I think that UUOTRO assumes that LSWPR is zero.
Probably UUOTRO should be changed to make these
things true or bomb immediately if they are not.
I can't say anything about the code in QDEL11
because that code is not in the DISK listing at all,
but it is probably a loss for any close routine to
go to UUOTRO.

Response to --MORE-- in peek can still take 15 seconds or so (although
not usually).  It's a lot better, but not perfect.  Also, I just gunned
down a job with "1000000" interrupt according to PEEK.  What is that
interrupt?  It took about 2 minutes for it to finally go away.  In
the meantime, it could not be :UJOB'd, its FLSINS was zero, its
state in PEEK was *MULTICS, its inferior disappeared at about the 1
minute mark, etc.  Also, HIC and I saw a hung tree.  A WHOLIN job was
hung waiting for output room, which isn't suprising but the HACTRN
was hung in USRI.  It went away OK when gunned (we were going to lunch,
not investigating the system).

A lot better than before, but still some quirks.

To: (BUG ITS) at MIT-MC
CC: JM at MIT-MC, ELLEN at MIT-MC, JPG at MIT-MC
Fooi, I sent mail before but it log lost in the crash.  Anyway, there
definitely IS a problem, but it's not just that performance is bad.  There
is a screwy interaction at work here between interrupts and I/O and the
scheduler.

When a job has non-defered pending interrupts, SCHACK does not skip-return,
leading to doing a full schedual.  I think this relates to the problem, in
that only jobs with pending interrupts are scrod.  Because they only get run
when a full schedual is done, they can be heavily discriminated against under
some circumstances.  I'm not sure just what those circumstances are, but PEEK
is screwed in --MORE-- but not elsewhere.  This only happens during heavy load,
presumably because the full schedual then happens more often.

These observations are based on a lot of poking around, with H19WHO keeping me
informed of the state of my current job.

1)  EMACS does it's input in a single big SIOT, getting MPV's along the way,
which it handles and creates the core.  Unfortunately, these interrupts may
take a very long time to go off, and it won't be schedualed until they do.

2)  PEEK .SLEEP's except during the --MORE-- break, where it waits in an input
.IOT ... which never returns, since when you type a space, the %PITYI interrupt
is asserted in .PIRQC, but NEVER GOES OFF.  If you clear this interrupt,
disable %PITYI in .MASK, type the space, it reads the space.  Then of course
you have to restore the mask, since PEEK reads it's commands at interrupt
level.

3)  When COMSAT loses, getting schedualed but every minute or so, I've checked,
found the pages required in core, at an ordinary BLT or TLNN etc., and with
a %PIRLT interrupt that WAS NOT GOING OFF.  Eventually the load would drop and
it would run.

4)  DDT sometimes doesn't get its interrupt when the inferior is ^Z'd, while
it's sitting in it's .HANG  I also saw a .DTTY take 20 seconds, I don't have
any other clues on that.  Oddly enough, giving DDT a ^G seems to wake it up
when it's hung in that manner.  Perhaps the TTY driver manages to frob it in
just the right way to make it run again, I don't know.  Or maybe it just
happened to get schedualed when I typed &^G, but that seems unlikely; why
didn't it get schedualed for 15 seconds before that?

Anyway, I hope this is enough to track down the problem.  The threshold of
load before it shows up is fairly high, requiring many runnable jobs.  Probably
enough to fill SCHBTB or something and just sit there keeping it full.


RWK@MIT-MC 05/27/80 12:00:50 Re: Slowness
To: (BUG ITS) at MIT-MC
CC: JM at MIT-MC
I'm not so sure that the reported slowness of disk I/O is anything other
than very heavy disk loading.  Looking at the channels listing in peek, we're
often in the 20-25 channel range, and it's not uncommon for there to be 15
competitors for one disk drive.  Normal is more like 15-20 range, with maybe
8-10 competitors for a drive.  Today seems to be more disk intensive than usual
for some reason.  TY is doing a DUMP.  There are several compilers and TEX jobs
plus the dover spooler and PFTHMG and ...

I've seen the system grind to a halt when there were 25 channels in use before.
And indeed, when it drops back down to normal, it doesn't seem grossly slower
than usual, although I can't assert it's normal.  Under the 25-channel load,
I read SYSEN1;DDT > (98 blocks) into an EMACS in 110 seconds, watching with
H19WHO updatng every 5 seconds.  Only 4 samples out of that period of 22 were
in other than +DSKBI.  Under conditions of about 18 channels in use the time
was 65 seconds with only one sample not in +DSKBI.  65 seconds is not
inconsistant with times I've observed before under "similar" load.  It has also
been observed by many people that the system is much less responsive WRT disk
I/O when a dump is being taken.

Disclamer:  The above observations do not show that the system is performing as
well as before.  My only assertion is that the data doesn't show it when
balanced with the load observed. and the lack of a control case.  "Before" data
would be necessary to make any reasonable judgements.

Further Disclamer:  The above does not mean that I think the schedular is
working 100% right.  There are other clear problems with it.  Have yo utried
continuing a --MORE-- break in PEEK lately?

BTW, ITS doesn't use an elevator algorithm for its disk I/O does it?
110 seconds for 98 pages against say 12 competitors for one disk drive
looks to me about right for randomly contending competitors, no?  This works
out to about 10 seconds for the single user, with having it seek the block,
then wait until the next schedual to transfer the block to the user's address
space (perform the SIOT) and queue up the next transfer.  I.e. about 1/10
second for each pair of seek/xfer and schedual.

Maybe elevator algorithm might be worthwhile during the heavier load
situations?  Also, read-ahead when you encounter an extent of more than one
block might help.

Maybe we should run the old system sometime in the daytime and take some
performance measurements to compare with the current situation?

It seems that EMACS can't be ^P'd while running a keyboard macro, because
it keeps doing .CALL of TTYGET.  Now while I doubt that TECO needs to be
doing .CALL of TTYGET while doing a keyboard macro, on the other hand it
should not require the TTY to do such a call, but should get the information

    of its internal translation table (which is fixed)!
ITS already does this.  EMACS attempts to open the ERR: device, and if that
open fails, for ANY REASON including Too Many Translations, it simply tries
again.  The historical reason for this may lie in the fact that many programs
(including TECO itself) were exhibiting the malfeasance of failing to CLOSE
the ERR device when done, and the system would occasionally get wedged due
to this.  A suitable PEEK mode was invented, and TECO at least was fixed to
close ERR when done, but this business of reexecuting a failed OPEN was not.

The real bug here is in Emacs, which if the OPEN of the ERR: device
fails simply retries.  I complained about this some time ago.

The fact that DDT will create an infinite translation
entry of this sort by way of the user typing <return><return>, is
perhaps at fault.  Maybe there should be YET ANOTHER DDT flag, or an
improvement to one of the existing ones, which would turn off nearly
all short commands which naive users would never want (, ,  are

This isn't really a bug, just a suggestion.  When one is using the DIR:
"device" and does, for example,  DIR:LISP;CDATE DOWN and then does a
 .INFO.;  (ie no change to FN1 or FN2) the DIR: has been changed back
to DSK: and the command barfs.  But if one changes only FN1 and/or FN2
then a MODE NOT AVAILABLE error occurs.  This really seems to be the
opposite of what should happen, DIR: should be "sticky" if only the
directory names is changed, otherwise it can revert back to DSK: if
filenames are changed.  I'm open to arguments for its present method
of operation but vote that this be changed in the future if possible.

It is semi-well-known that a comma ends a filespec in DDT, as does
a CR; CR in addition ends the command.  Consider :RENAME, for example;
if you type :RENAME FOO GREPS,BARF GREPS the comma terminates
the first file name and the second altmode redisplays the second
file name.  This is actually useful.  However, had one used
 instead of :RENAME (), then the comma terminates the
command, but the command doesn't "run" until the second altmode
is typed.  Moreover, any stuff after the comma is lost -- the second altmode
doesn't redisplay it or anything.  Maybe for safety's sake the number
of commas should be counted and a complaint registered if there are
too many.  Also, typing an altmode should NEVER cause the command to be run!
The whole point is to be able to see the name of the file you are
about to dastardly mung.

the form

cause most filename readers to ignore the ML: by clobbering the device
field with ARn:.  The exception is :FIND, which makes a LIST of all
devices (and directories) to be searched.  Is it possible you were led
down the garden path by having similar archives on 2 machines?  Experiment
with the MLTTY: device and you will see that MLTTY: gives you ML's, ML:TTY:

    How about changing the definition of %TDICP n from being "insert
    n blanks in the current line" to being "insert next n characters
    in the current line"?  I suspect that no programs would have to
    change (i.e. TECO wouldn't).  The reason for the chnage would be
    to allow insertion to happen more reasonably on some terminals
    (in particular those with an insert character mode), without
    making it any less efficient for terminals like TVs or the
    Teleray.  CRTSTY would make use of the new constraint on what can
    follow a %TDICP, and maybe ITS could too.

I don't think it would be a good idea to change the %TDICP definition.
The idea is certainly clever, but I am paranoid about what could
happen if the output stream was interrupted or otherwise disrupted
while counting down these N characters, since this is also in effect
quoting the next N characters.  It seems much more robust to have a
way to enter insert-char mode and leave it; then a reset of this mode
would always be effective.  It would also be just as efficient, since
a %TDICP N is two characters plus the string, whereas a %TDSIC and
%TDEIC (Start & End insert-char mode) is also just two chars plus the
string.  I don't see anything wrong with having more %TD codes, except
that a TTYOPT bit might be needed to say whether the terminal could
handle it or not; if not, ITS would just simulate it with %TDICP's.

One outcome of the disk storage crunch getting worse and worse is that there
will be more randoms deleting random files.

It seem like a program that would combine the facilities of COMMON;FIND JUNK
and DIRED would be useful.  In addition, it would keep track of what files
were deleted and who deleted them.  In this way people would be less tempted
to do rash deletions.  It might do other things such as refusing

One obvious application of the Greek/Front key on the PDP-10
is that all such characters could be self-inserting in TEX format;
thus typing  would insert "\alpha", etc.  I don't know how much
more convenient this would make it to type weird formulas in TEX.

I don't think ITS is going to be able to accomodate all of the new
modifier bits.  There are no free bits in the present internal
(18-bit) character code.  I don't think making Greek input work
is very important, since we certainly aren't going to go to the
very large amount of trouble required to make Greek output work
and have a more-than-7-bit printing-character set.

It would be nice to make Super and Hyper work to ITS, although there
are not enough bits available.  Note that shift-lock has already been
recycled.  Shift is sort of recycled and sort of vestigially still
there; it could be recycled for this.  It isn't necessary to be able to
represent all 16 combinations of the "bucky bits"; for instance there
are 8 combinations of 0, 1, or 2-adjacent buckies.

Since the function keys are there, you may as well make up top+>40
codes for them.  Some of the function keys map into keys on the old
keyboard; see the #\ table in LMIO;READ for something from which this
mapping can be derived, as we are doing it on the Lisp machine now.
From memory, it's clear-screen->form, delete->vt, clear-input->clear,
macro->back-next (but should be system->backnext in your case), terminal->esc.

It's not obvious that new keyboards will ever be attached to the AI TVs.
We might, and we might not.  It would involve slowing down the keyboard
scanner substantially, and we might have to put some buffering in the
keyboard microprocessor.

We are going to hook up a new kbd to the PTV system in the next few
days, and the obvious question comes up about how to encode all
the function keys.  I suppose they could be handled the way
they are on the old keyboard, namely send chars with the TOP bit +
100 + <code>.  In order to distinguish them from the old kbd,
how about encoding them in 140-177?  Presumably the extra modifier
bits (SUPER, HYPER, and GREEK) need to be allowed (that uses up
all the bits available in the intelligent terminal protocol, unless
we want to flush SHIFT and SHIFT-LOCK).  It doesn't much matter
what the encoding is, as long as its documented.  I guess any
part of the system which masks off the high modifier bits or
otherwise depends on them being zero will have to get looked at.

ITS presumably wants to know about the SYSTEM key (treat like BACK/NEXT).

Its about time DDT knew about CLEAR (or CLEAR INPUT on the new kbds) which
should behave like ^D.  Also, HELP, STOP OUTPUT (^S, actually this should
probably be defined to do an output hold at the terminal, followed by an
output reset from the remote process (as is currently done)), ABORT (^G), END
(^C), RESUME ($P), etc.

TELNET and SUPDUP should be informed about the NETWORK key.

Various programs should know about END, ABORT, RESUME, BREAK, QUOTE, HELP,
STATUS (I'm not saying every program in the world should be retrofitted
to know about these, but the basic ones -- DDT, TECO, LISP -- probably
should).

I suspect that not much is going to happen on this until AI TV's start
getting new keyboards, but I would at least like to see the encoding
defined now, so that where only simple changes are required, they
can be done quickly when desired.

I think FAST-APPEND can win using the following algorithm:
-------------------
If canonical file doesn't exist:
	Check for AOS'd version, and rename to canonical.
Find message-EOF of file:
	Re-open in read mode if not already in.
	Set .ACCESS ptr to file-EOF
	Read backwards until a msg-EOF mark is seen (ie ctl-_)
If canonical file already existed, msg-EOF is set to file-EOF.
Re-open file in write-over mode
Set .ACCESS ptr to msg-EOF
Write message.
	If IOC for some reason, just stop.
Close channel.
-------------------
	Note that there is no need to do anything about RENMWO'ing,
because following attempts will always start at the right place, and
it doesn't matter if the next attempt doesn't quite extend past the
true file EOF, because following appends will still back up to the
new msg-EOF mark.
	It would be a LOT more efficient if there
was some way to both read and write the file while it was open;
ironically enough the only way to do this now is to map into the
system buffer and see what's there!!  The data is there, but the
system won't let you get at it.  Foo.
	It would probably be easier to allow some way of doing
this dual I/O ("read-while-locked"?) mode than to hack APPEND mode,
since it doesn't depend on anything fundamental to the UFD.
	Another idea is for ITS to support this algorithm internally,
given the EOF delimiter(s) as argument.  Might be invoked by an OPEN
mode bit, or a new CALL.  This requires even less overhead and
makes the feature generally available.  This also
prevents race conditions since presumably one process would be
locked out while the other's APPEND effort progressed; this sort of
system-supported reliability could also make it reasonable to
use FAST-APPEND on normal MAIL files (since the FN2 is just 4 letters
and an AOS will stand out).

I'd claim this is a lot more useful than ECHOIN's hacking TECO buffers!
The amount of really gross disk I/O that the COMSAT does seems to far
exceed the amount of TTY-echo overhead being done, especially on AI.

Any comments on this scheme?  (No, I'm not likely to stop trying.)

I use a Teleray 1061 with SIPB prom, and the display of overlong
lines seems to be incorrect.  I suspect that both the terminal and
ITS are providing an extra <CR>, because the continuation skips
a line before writing the remainder of the line.  If something was
previously on the skipped line, it remains (i.e. nobody does a
clear-to-end-of-line on <CR>).  This makes the text remarkably
difficult to read.  This happens most noticeably in RMAIL.

I wonder how hard it would be to make the following modifications

[a] when a file is deleted, shuffle its five-word block to the
middle of the directory rather than just overwriting it.  Thus, a
rotation of a number of five-word blocks would occur, I think.
[b] install the uname of the deleting job as the file's "author".

This would tend (though not guarantee) to preserve information

Given the SIXBIT name of a STY device, such as "S20", or just the number
such as 20, it should be easy to find out whether or not that STY is in use
by any job (your own job, or anybody else).  Anybody know how to do it?
Apparantly currently you can't do it unless you know the TTY that is
associated with it, thus making it impossible to write a subroutine that
gets you a new STY you don't already have unless you have  been keeping
a list of STYs-you-have all along since you started acquiring STYs.

Hmm, okay, I guess I hadn't been willing to believe that completely
unrestricted simulated ttys would number only 6, so I assumed that
only a subset of them were allowed as net ports.  Amazing that you
can survive with only 6!  Assuming most of them are normally in
use for net ports or lisp-machine users, I find it hard to believe
that you can get enough STYs for CRTSTY and other uses.  Maybe you
don't use them as much on ITS as we do at SAIL.

Recently I have become involved in a discussion of the relative merits
of CRTSTY vs TCTYP support for C100's.  My personal feeling is that
the TCTYP support is inadequate in a number of areas, the largest being
its lack of support for the "Sail" character set.  Granted CRTSTY
takes an extra job slot, I feel that its support is enough better
that I prefer it (CRTSTY).

What do other people think?

    Re:   net ports

    Incidentally, I consider it a crock of the finest shit that, for whatever
    reason(s), CRTSTY uses up an extra network port (of which I'm told there
    are only 6) instead of a system-internal simulated tty.  Do all STYs on
    ITS use net ports, or just CRTSTY STYs?  With net ports so rare, such an
    implementation seems rather silly.
It does use a system-internal simulated TTY.  That's what a STY is.  That is
also what a "net port" is.  It's not a limitation on how many network
connections there are, but on the number of system-internal simulated tty's.
While I would agree that 6 may be a little too few in the case of AI, it IS
a very heavily loaded machine, and there is justification for wanting to limit
the number of users coming in via the network.  This has nothing to do with
whether CRTSTY is implemented in the reasonable way; it is.

DDT version 1388 runs on AI and MC.  On MC, lower-case
characters typed as the first thing to DDT's command
loop (as in foo/ or foo, as opposed to :foo) generates
an OP? error.  On AI, this is not the case.  Further,
loading SYS;ATSIGN DDT into a job gets the same foul
behavior, but doing :copy sys;atsign ddt,common;random file
and then loading common;random file WINS!
It seems that the pure page that's always in core is broken.
Starting up several 256K jobs that referenced all their pages
managed to get the offending page swapped out which fixed things.
From this I gather that when a pure page is swapped, it is replaced
from the original, rather than put a dupe in the swap area.
Wierd.

    Is there any way the init files that use up almost all the file slots on
    users1/users2/users3 could be compacted (or the dir allocation changed)?
    That way, tourists who actually wanted to use storage for something other
    then init files (like documents or lisp programs) could do so more readily.
    I think this might make tourist's use of the system more productive.  Would
    this be too hard to do?
-----
Unfortunatly, the size of a directory is fixed by the system and cannot
be changed.  We realize that the USERSn directories get full, and there
is no easy fix.  Generally, it is possible to reap enough from the dirs
so that they are only about 75% full, but that takes time.  If the guests
were more responsible about cleaning up, the problem wouldn't be so bad.
Many people are on INFO-MICRO and don't read their 15 blocks of mail for
three months!  You should not be using the USERn dirs for anything but
very short term storage because you are lucky enough to have use of a
real dir on ML.  If a tourist wants to be productive, (s)he can always
find a way -- it's really that most of them don't particularly care.

How are you getting to ITS?  If you're using a TELNET program I
suspect the problem is that it's doing some processing on the
output ITS sends.  Nothing in the path from ITS to your C100
should modify a single character output.

:TCTYP C100 works for other people, over the network.  That's why
I suspect it is a local problem.  Probably an over zealous
operating system turning form feeds into LFs.

P.S. don't include BUG-EMACS anymore, it's not relevant here.

   In order to examine why the :CLEAR command was not clearing the
screen of my CONCEPT APL, I put the terminal into transparent mode
in order to examine the characters ITS was sending down the line
in response to that command. The octal sequence was as follows:
 
   015 015 012 177 033 023 177 012 012 012 012
                             012 012 012 012 177 177 177 177 177 177

Among other things you should notice that there is not a single "clear
screen" (^L, FF, 014) in the entire transmission! Instead we have some
carraige returns (^M, CR, 015), some line feeds (^J, LF, 012), a single
"clear to end of line/field" ($ ^S, ESC DC3, 033 023), and some random
padding characters (DEL, 177).
   If all the routines in ITS send this same sequence thinking it is
going to clear a screen instead of just move the cursor down 9 lines,
this may explain the problems I encountered earlier.
   I am using the CONCEPT Reference Manual (DN1300-7808-1) and the

Perhaps your terminal is not getting the right amount of
padding...  I suggest on the same TCTYP line along with C100 you
add SPEED #, i.e.  as in

:TCTYP C100 SPEED 9600

so the system will insert the right amount of padding (9600
baud's worth in this case).  I suspect this is your most likely
cause of lossage if operating over 300 baud.

   I am a new user on the ARPAnet and a new user on the MIT-AI
computer. I have used INFO for the past several days, using a
CONCEPT 100 terminal identified via a "TCTYP C100" command.
My reason for sending this note is that the screen control on my
terminal has been somewhat messy. I do not know if this is due
to a mistake in screen control or in the INFO program, so I thought
I'd simply describe the problem and let you sort it out.
   When I give a command such as "INFO INTRO" the display proceeds
as if on a regular TTY, i.e., the information is "painted" on the
screen line by line, scrolling the terminal when the cursor hits the
bottom line of the display. This usually results in "INFO docu-
mentation reader" line being left on the LAST line of the display
screen instead of in its usual place two lines above that. This
causes problems later when the screen is being overwritten, because
some display lines which are blank simply do a linefeed over the
previous text, leaving it on the screen along with the newer display.
Needless to say, these garbage lines make understanding of the new
display somewhat difficult.
   Once, and this happened on a redisplay request (^L) as well, the
scrolling operation was proceeding as described above when the cursor
jumped into the middle of the screen and continued from there. This
left a very confusing screen as a result.
   I think that a fair number of these problems could be removed if
the screen could be cleared once in awhile. This would remove possible 
garbage lines and also position the screen from the top down instead
of from the bottom up, thus putting everything where it was expected 
right off the bat. As it is, the screen is NEVER cleared.
   If there is anything you would like me to try on my terminal to help
identify what is going on more specifically, just let me know.

I've nevver seriously considered departing AI altogether, but

Subject: New ITS on MC has disk deadlocks
To: (BUG ITS) at MIT-MC
CC: RWK at MIT-MC, JPG at MIT-MC

A phenomenon we've observed repeatedly on this new system is for it to go
into a mode where reading directories (for everyone trying to do so) for
up to several minutes.  It tends to hang repeatedly with short unhangings
for quite a while, and then suddenly clear up.  It tends to happen when DUMP
is running, grovelling over large numbers of directories.  I just saw such
a state, and managed to get a little info before it unhung.  The DUMP's
FLSINS was SKIPG QFUD (it was hung in this, QFUD being zero).  All the
directories were in use (QSNUD non-zero), aparently brought in by DUMP
(mostly in alphabetical order).  Other jobs trying to do things and getting
hung hung waiting on QSKOSW, which was locked by the DUMP frob.  That's about
all I could get before it spontaneously started working again.

System keeps dying here on me at least. Echos all chars but doesn't do
anything. T^F doesn't even work ... wierd. Any guesses? It's like everything
ITS does in the way of interrupt handling works, but that's all. No jobs 
no ddt commands run. I detached myself from another tty and then tried to ^Z
the console. Took it fully a minute or more to get it to listen. another 
console next door had same problem. both freed at same time. system must
be hanging some obscure way.

Why is it that

.CALL [SETZ ? 'FOOBAR ? SETZM]
fails to skip and returns an ILLEGAL SYSTEM CALL NAME error code?
I smell a crock.  Of course, I deserve no better, executing randomly
named system calls.  On the other hand, and related to this, the
.GETSYS uuo returns a list of NCALLS that includes ?_____ not once, but

The real problem here is that the directory is full.  DDT has long supported,

To: RJF at MIT-MC
CC: JPG at MIT-MC, (BUG PLOT2) at MIT-MC, (BUG ITS) at MIT-MC
CC: (BUG CRTSTY) at MIT-MC

Most of the shortcuts taken by PLOT2 when plotting on printing
terminals are in fact done by ITS.  (E.g. the suppression of
trailing spaces on a line, and the use of backspaces instead of
return+spaces.)  Support of hardware tabs by PLOT2 would similarly
be best done by ITS (e.g. via a new TCTYP).  If this is not done
then maybe CRTSTY could do the job.  (I believe CRTSTY may have
some minimum requirements which rules this out.)  Support of
tabs by PLOT2 itself would be the least desirable because (1)
nothing else (e.g. :print) would benefit, and (2) because Plot2
would have to implement ITS's other shortcuts at the same time.
(However, I don't rule out the support of tabbing by PLOT2.)
If ITS or CRTSTY also supported abs. curdsor positioning on daisy
wheel printers, you would be able to win using Plot2 by setting
PLOTMODE:DISPLAY$
An absolute requirement for the implementation of any of this
by any system is an EXACT specification of the  commands needed
to make the tabbing/cursor positioning work.

Using the .LOSE argument of .CALL DISMIS is really terribly inconvenient

There's an archive device handler here, hung in a .CALL FINISH on its disk
output channel.  The channel is in REAI mode according to PEEK's C mode.
It's definately an output channel, so I guess PEEK must display append-mode
channel's oddly.  Claims its 100% read.

that people spend half the day doing :SHOUT FLUSH JOBS!
which is a nuisance.  As for example, right now, there
is noone logged in from the ARPA net -- just
local people, none of whom are running more than a
Lisp and an Emacs and maybe an occasional compiler,
and there are no free job slots to run even a :MAIL

You might experiment with CRTSTY's padding at 9600 and when you find

different padding times (which are floating point no.s - it is

I noticed this phenomenon about 2 weeks ago when the system crashed 
and RWK reloaded it, and mentioned it to him, but I wasn't as certain 
then, so didn't report it.
I wonder if this has something to do with swapping disk somehow using

getting screwed up.  Whatever, something is doing this!
