The crack team has begun to work;

A lot of the documentation for MX (KL-10) must be spread out, i
can't find it around the machine.

So all of you that has bits and pices, bring it to the 9:th floor
before sunday, please.


(As the system will not fill the container more than 40% or so,
 we vold like donations of other stuff, like Lisp-machines, AAA terminals,
 a IMP, Conection machines, retired 2060's etc, (I'm not joking...))

"The time has come," said LCS,
    "MX at last must go.
Its day has gone.  We need that space
    Most urgently."  And so
Before we crate it, let us give
    A final cheerio.

Once there was a KL-10 called MIT-MC which belonged to the Macsyma
Consortium.  It provided Macsyma, the symbolic algebra system, to
researchers all over the world, and mail gatewaying and mailing list
support to a large fraction of the Arpanet.  Things continued in this
fashion from 1975 to 1983.

When the Macsyma Consortium dissolved in 1983, MC turned to providing
cycles for MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science, and continued supporting
much of the Arpanet's mail service.  But the machine itself was growing old
and cranky.  In 1986, the mail services were moved to a smaller, more
maintainable machine (a KS-10), and the name "MC" was moved with them.
But the KL-10 continued to run under the new name "MX".

Now the end has come.  MX was down cold for several months, and has only
been revived recently to copy some old 7-track tapes.  LCS can't keep MX
any longer -- it needs the space for other purposes.  So the KL is being
sent to the Home for Aged But Beloved PDP-10s; a crack team of hardware
hackers will arrive next week to dismantle it and take it back with them to
Sweden.

In celebration of this momentous event, we are holding a small farewell
gathering:

I just got out of a meeting where we were discussing plans for various
renovations at LCS.  You should know that we have a big-name
researcher moving into LCS from another part of MIT.  This has top
priority with our front office people, and the deadlines for it are
tight.

To make a long story short, we have the following situation.  As you
know, we need the KL for long enough to finish copying the Macsyma
tapes from 7-track to 9-track tape.  The official estimate of when
that will finish is sometime between 31 August and 15 September.  The
actual date is unknown, since the project depends heavily on hardware
that is known to be flakey; Penny is doing a heroic job but it may
simply not be possible to finish the job on schedule.

The renovation plans are going to require that the KL be gone by the
end of September.  The need for the floorspace is bad enough that it
is my estimation that if the tape copying isn't done in time, it will
be left incomplete rather than extend the deadline.  I could be wrong
about this.  Enough other things are depending on having the KL gone
that, if you guys can't come over here and handle the disassembly, the
machine will be removed anyway and shipped to a warehouse somewhere.
Management is aware that disassembly by people who don't understand
the machine may well mean that it will never run again; they don't
care about this enough to offset their need for the floorspace.

None of the MIT ITS people are going to have time to handle the
disassembly (I know that JTW and I won't and I'm virtually certain
that Moon and Bawden won't either).  MIT is not willing to pay what it
would cost to have DEC do the de-installation (we estimate this as
being in the thousands of US dollars).

Tom Greene tells me that you would prefer to do the job in November.
Hence this letter, to tell you that if you wait that long you will
probably not get a working machine out of the deal.  I realize that
this puts you in a bad position, since we can't even tell you when the
tape work will be done with any degree of certainty.

Our best guess of when we need you guys over here starting the
deinstallation is 19 September.  We can't put it off much after that.
How likely is it that you can do this?

I appreciate your searching for magtape heads that we might be able to
use.  Sorry I haven't responded earlier to the recent flurry of messages
about your search, but I went on vacation last week on the day before the
first of these messages and just got back.

No, we haven't found any heads to use in our drives.  We had a couple of
close calls, but the heads that were located were for different tape
speeds, and our experience indicates that such heads don't work (we had
one such spare ourselves and were disappointed to discover the
incompatibility).

We have, however, now sent out one set of heads to be remanufactured.
They say that the result will be heads better than new (harder heads), and
I'm hoping they're right (and that they can reconstruct the heads
precisely enough).

So, feel free to discontinue your search, but on the other hand, if you
did turn up a set of heads in reasonable shape that would work, I think we
would still be interested in them.  If you find a potential set of such
heads, just check the part number on the heads -- if it is Datamec
10400-9S, then it's a winner.  I have to assume that heads made by anyone
else wouldn't work, unless they were definitely for 7-track 45-ips drives.
Our drives, by the way, date from about 1966.

Yeah, I found this documentation in the cabinet (since your description let
me to know what to look for).  Apparently it is just called a TU40,
although it is of the 7-track variety.  I don't seem to be able to find
anything that tells me anything about the heads though.  (It -must- be

We still have one of the TU20's in the basement. I don't know what the specs are for the thing. It is

 I will  try to find the specs on the head and see if they match yours..

    sorry marty -- as you've noticed, the heads are what go.  DM and the

Actually, DM had a 9-track drive.

    perhaps someone could talk gerry brown (the lcs stockroom guru and boss
    of the storage areas) into letting him poke around in the lcs basement
    rooms to see whether dm's drive is still around -- but it's pretty

    Hi, Steve.  We're looking for some replacement magtape heads for our
    old 7-track tape drives, and someone here said there were some old tape
    drives (and other computer stuff) in the basement of the MIT AI lab
    building.  I wonder if you could check for us, or maybe ask someone
    else there to check this out.
    What we have are DEC 545 7-track 45 ips drives, which are really
    Datamec D2020 drives, and the heads are Datamec catalog number 10400-9S
    (stamped on the head assembly).  All we need is the head assembly.
    Our heads are pretty worn and now we want to read some 2700 old tapes
    to convert them to 9-track tapes.  So if there are the same heads
    sitting there no longer being used (or better, unused spares sitting
    around), then we could certainly make good use of them.  If there are
    the same heads there but they are well worn (noticeable groove cut into
    the head by the tape), then they're probably not useful to us.  The
    heads would have to be for a 45-ips drive to work for us.
    If we can't find any spare heads, we'll have our heads remanufactured.
    But if you can find out anything for us, I'd certainly appreciate it.
    Thanks.

We looked at, but didn't actually get around to fixing the DH lines.
Now that the power supply is back up, we should organize a DH fixing
party.  It shouldn't take to much effort to arrange to have one
working (and one doubly broken) DH  and get the dialups active again.

Well. Once again the KL is running.

In the last month various people have repaired:

 The console PDP-11
 The RP04s
 The DH11 modem TTY lines
 The main CPU power supplies.

Maybe that will keep it going for a little while longer.

I took MX out of the *ITS and *BBOARD lists because I'm sick of seeing
duplicate messages.  People seem to assume that their whole message
failed when they get a failure message about MX, and resend it.

Because of the way it was defined, I removed *MX as well.

I made the change on AI, MC, and ML.  MD seems to be down at the

Oh well, I should have disconnected it completely. The power supply in

Those of you who remember Guttag's VAX...

I think things can be fixed, but it will take an evening. In the

The bad news, folks, is that this problem with Circuit Breaker 9 on the
power supply blowing out continues to happen.  MX managed to run from about
11 last night until about 5 this morning, before that breaker tripped.  I
left it down because I figured that we should make an attempt to discover

first (dialup & ??) worse than the 2nd.  See the console printout for

MAP and Alan are planning to rearrange lines & hardware addresses on

the problem on the 2nd DH11 is so minor that IOELEV won't ever notice

Message-ID: <226404.870711.ALAN@AI.AI.MIT.EDU>

The KL's front end PDP11 (the "console 11") is broken.  When we powered up
the machine last night, it was unable to boot from disk.  It was able to
boot from DECtape, so Moon poked around (using KLDCP) to try and figure out
if something was wrong with its RH11.

Halfway through this process, the 11 stoped working completely.  You can
deposit stuff in memory from the switches and read it back, and you can get
the boot-from-DECtape program (stored in some kind of read-only memory) to
run.  But as soon as you try to execute any instructions from real memory,
you generally discover that the real memory contains gubbish.

Moon and JTW pulled the 11 out of the cabinet and poked around with a volt
meter to see if there were any obvious problems, but found nothing.  At
this point the meeting was adjourned.

Recall that the dialups haven't been functioning for some time now, and
that they are also attached to the console 11.  Also the console LA36 has
occasionally been uncooperative, although reloading the 11 generally fixed
that immediately.  I personally suspect some kind of slow Unibus rot.  I
wonder if there is any signifigance to the fact that the dialup interface
is at the far end of the Unibus (in the extension cage on the other side of
the processor bays)?

Perhaps its time for some PDP11 hackers to emerge to save the day?

    ... With two of three RP04's offline it becomes difficult, although
    probably not impossible to bring ITS back up again.  Before anyone
    tries that, it might be a good idea to see if any diagnostics can find
    the problem.

I made a half-hearted attempt to bring MX up again the other night, but
quickly became discouraged.  Any given file has a 50% chance of being
unavailable, which makes the undertaking quite an interesting game of
chance.  

Luckily the most recent version of ITS itself is sitting on pack #0, and
luckily there is a version of Exec DDT on Pack #0 as well, and there is
even a file in the front-end-filesystem that knows how to load it up (its
not a regular .CMD file though, so you have to type in a few commands by
hand...)

The salvager dumped out with ITS won't let you bring the system up without
pack #1, and .;@ SALV is on pack #1.  But @ OSALV is on pack #0, so you can
use it to check out the filesystem before starting ITS by hand at GO.

SYS;ATSIGN HACTRN is a link to SYS;ATSIGN PWORD which is on pack #1.
ATSIGN DDT is also on pack #1, but there is an ATSIGN ODDT on pack #0, so
one way to proceed is to rename this to be ATSIGN HACTRN.  (Or patch ITS to
use the name ODDT rather than HACTRN...)

Another possibility is to install a new HACTRN over the network.  (Using
the network is necessary eventually anyway, because to get other missing
stuff back from tape, we need SYSBIN;DUMP BIN which is on pack #1.)
SYS;ATSIGN CHAOS is on pack #1, but ATSIGN TCP is on pack #0 and so is
SYSBIN;FTPS BIN, so this is a viable path as well.

At this point I stopped, because it became clear that in order for the
machine to be useful to anyone, I would have to pull a -lot- of stuff back
from tape onto a pack that was already mostly full.  There was clearly a
lot of work ahead, and it would be wasted effort if it turns out that the
drive can be fixed by swapping power supplies with unit #1, or something
equally trivial.

Unit #0 on the KL has been getting a lot of errors in the last few days.
Hard ECC errors, header compare errors and header CRC errors.  The lossage
seems to be intermittent.  (Like I'll find a network server that died with
an irrecoverable data error on some file, but I have no trouble reading the
file myself.)  I've also found a few network servers dead signaling parity
errors (%PIPAR set), but the system hasn't done an ordinary parity sweap
since the system came up.  Moon thinks that this is what ITS does when an
irrecoverable disk error happens while swapping.

If we are about to lose another RP04, this could be the end.  Of course if
-someone- wants to try and collect all of the important system files on to
pack #0, we could split the two-pack primary disk system into parts.  I'll
be happy to offer advice to any takers.

Of course perhaps we should try DUPing pack #0 first, in case the problem
is with with the pack and not the drive.

    terminal interface.  I know 11s fairly well, and I think that give a
    DH11 manual, I can at least isolate the problem better.
    Rob has told me that he doesn't mind if I shut the machine down to hack
    on it when it is idle, so I'm warning you (and solicting comments)
    about this project.  I probably won't do anything before early next
    week in any case (no DH manual, not much time).

i think it's a dandy idea. but i'm not the only one with a vested interest
in the blue monster. this list should catch most of them.

assuming that you go ahead, please be careful about bringing ITS down and
up, and if necessary powercycling the 10, during your experiments; as you
know, we can't call in DEC to fix anything that gets fried.

The current theory is that one of the DH-11s might be out (just one of
the four-line blocks, actually).  Anybody with data to confirm or deny
this theory is encouraged to speak up; I don't even know where the tty
line configuration info lives on ITS, although I suppose I could figure

Some TMRC people have mentioned that they might wander by with a scope

Sorry to get in on this so late, but I am a bit confused about all the
arguments.  It seems that all the issue of office space and where CR
should be is independent of the KL issue, and can probably be resolved
satisfactorily.  So the real question is do we want to and can we
afford to keep MX?  In its current state of unreliability, I see no
advantage at all to keeping it.  In fact, I have had to move all the
people in my group who use it off MX 'cause it was just too ill to
provide any useful service.  The real problem, I think, is just that
it's too expensive to maintain the beast and we don't have the talent
lying around to maintain it on the cheap.  This is not an unusual fate
for 11 or 12 year old machines, and I'm not sure I see what reason
there is to shed big tears over it.  I'm open for argument, but my
current impression is that MX is a great big white elephant and I

	When IMP 6 (the Mil Spec one) was decomissioned I tried to
get the MIT Museum interested and they weren't, on the grounds that
MIT hadn't built the machine. The Computer Museum might have a more
enlightened attitude to a machine which was novel for software reasons,
not necessarily hardware, but who knows?

Penny, you are missing the point.  The excuse doesn't need to be
valid, just sound good enough to shut people up.  We're talking about
politics, and MX doesn't have much of a constituency left (not people
with voting rights, anyway).

After talking with JTW and with Tom Green about this, my attitude is
that I'd like to keep the machine alive, but I don't intend to spend
my next N years worth of brownie points doing so.  If PSZ and GJS (and
those others of their rank that Big Mike will listen to) don't think
it's worth the effort, I'm not going to fight it.

Has anybody sounded out the Computer Museum about the beast?  It is a
pretty big piece of history, and Tom really does want to find it a
good home rather than just pushing it off the roof.  I'm not committed
to this idea, but it does sound like a more reasonable end than having
the CPU finally melt down into a pile of slag.

    FYI, the current theory seems to be that we suddenly need the floor space;
    somebody (I think Al Vezza but it might be Big Mike) wants CR group (me,
    Ty, Bede, etc) out of the fifth floor and onto the ninth, which (1) gets us
    janitorial types out of space that could be used by researchers, (2) gives
    a "good" reason to flush the KL for floorspace.  From their point of view
    this solves several thorny problems at once.

Darth Vezza and Grand Moff D. do not have a leg (collectively) to stand on.
if they're just so desperate to strand you & your friends on the ninth
floor, they can
 1. move some of the remaining VAXen in the VAX farm around to create a
nice roomy office next to 936, and
 2. lean on AI a bit to remove the remains of Gutenburg, the Twenex doc
boxes, etc., and have a nice roomy office by the dover.
 in both cases they would be recreating office space that used to be there.
before the vax farm, LCS had a row of offices against the 9th south wall,
and of course there used to be 926 on the east wall.  they -do not- need to
sacrifice the KL to get space, yet.

I mentioned this particular configuration because it is the largest
that will fit in one row along the wall, and thus not take up very
much space. No question it'd be throwing away too much stuff, but
that's politics for you.

    I found some diags that triggered the problem seen under ITS (random parts
    of a disk block read as zeros). Went through and gave all the flip-chips
    and cable connectors in the DF10 a good rattle. Things seem to be working
    OK now.

Wonderful!  Thanks a million, including for not making me follow through on my
rash remark of the other evening.

    One possible future for this dinosaur is that we negotiate some kind of
    a compromise where a much smaller KL (maybe the CPU, 2 memory boxes, and
    the DEC disk system) remains in a corner of the 9th floor. I am curious
    as to whether anybody cares enough to be willing to help move stuff around
    at some point if things work out that way.

I'd be happy to help move stuff around.  But I don't think you can make
the machine quite that small.  "Maybe the CPU"?  The machine isn't too
much use without its 7-track tape drive; think about what happens if
there's some sort of disk trouble.  I also don't think we want to lose
the Chaosnet.  Maybe we can move the Chaosnet to the other 11; it'll be
slow, but not as slow as the Chaosnet interfaces we're using now on the
KS's.  Then we could junk the second 11, the DL10, and the T-300s.
That's cool, but somebody's gotta write a little software.  If the CPU
moves more than a few feet, the Arpanet connection will be lost -- maybe
that's considered okay.  On the other hand, maybe the cpu can't move
because moving the 10-ton outlet it plugs into would be too expensive.
I'd say keep 3 memory boxes, one for spares.  So I say the machine can
plausibly be decreased from 16 refrigerators plus 6 disk drives to 12
refrigerators plus 2 disk drives.  Maybe 11 refrigerators if we take
advantage of the fact that there's a lot of air inside a DF10.

Subject: Future of the KL

[PSZ, sorry about the multiple copies, but I can't figure out where
 you read mail these days.  Talk to me about this?]

Esteemed ITS lovers.

A move seems to be underway in LCS-HQ to declare the KL dead.  This is
not definite (I can't get a straight answer out of the people who
really know what HQ is doing, but it's my reading of what they tell
me).  I have been asked to find a good home for the thing where it can
be kept as an honored museum piece.  If anybody knows of such a place,
let me know and I'll pass it along, but that's not really the issue.

The issue is whether or not we are going to let HQ do this.  GJS, PSZ,
you guys have a lot of weight with Big Mike, could you be persuaded to
sit on his desk till he gives up this silly idea?

I got into this because my new boss, Tom Greene, has been put in the
position of ping-pong ball; HQ tells him to flush the machine, and
he's new enough here that he can't really tell them to go away.  I
think.  It is just barely possible that he himself wants the KL
flushed, but it's unlikely.

In either case, the easiest way to handle this would be to convince
Mike that this is not a good idea, and let Tom get the news from
above.

FYI, the current theory seems to be that we suddenly need the floor
space; somebody (I think Al Vezza but it might be Big Mike) wants CR
group (me, Ty, Bede, etc) out of the fifth floor and onto the ninth,
which (1) gets us janitorial types out of space that could be used by
researchers, (2) gives a "good" reason to flush the KL for floorspace.
From their point of view this solves several thorny problems at once.

If I sound annoyed it's because I don't like AV and friends using a
new and confused person to do their dirty work.  And of course I don't
want the KL flushed.  I wouldn't mind a decent office on the 9th
floor, but I'm not a canible

I ran some disk diagnostics on the KL. The DF10/RH10/RP04 setup does

to do anything that smacks of a reliability test. Barf.

    The problem, I suspect, is that something is clobbering data written to
    disk by bashing words N through the end of the block (where N varies) to
    zero.  This happened to the MFD and to several UFD's.  Originally I thought
    this happened as a side-effect of power going off, but if several directories
    were clobbered in one incident, that can't be the cause.

    Unfortunately my most likely candidate for doing this would be the DF10,
    a virtually unmaintainable piece of hardware.  We had some code in the
    system, developed when the (old) ML machine was dying, for doing
    software read-compares on all disk writes.  Looks like it better be
    revived if we're going to bring MX back up.  That's easier than getting
    the system to run with no RP04s (all T-300s).  I'll look into this
    eventually if no one else does it first.  Probably the system needs to
    be reassembled to turn on that code.

I turned on that code (see the log book) and it sort of works, but seems to
crash a lot with the DF10 executing complete garbage control words.  I gave
up for the night.  Maybe I screwed up the cache stuff, maybe it screws up
when it gets a correctable ecc error, or maybe the hardware is broken.
Anyway the Comsat database seems to be clobbered; there are some nulls and
things in LIST MASTER, and MAKMST didn't seem to work either.  The new code
in the system can be turned off by patching QRCSW/0

Huh?  So what's still broken?  Do you mean that the the MFD on unit #2
didn't have the directories either?  Then perhaps you should try running
the MFDR routine in the salvager to try to reconstruct the MFD from the
directory blocks.  (I've never done that myself, so I can't tell you what
that will be like.  You might want to glance though a salvager listing
first to see what it thinks it does.  Recall that this is the pre-CStacy
salvager, so you can have some confidence that it might work.)

I have installed a new fan in the KL, leaving the machine at least
willing to stay on.

It even appears to work almost. There is something broken such that
most jobs (net logins, daemons) won't start. Logging in from a
hardwired line works fine. Someone who knows something might look at
this.

The spindle bearing on RP04 unit 2 is discontent. While we could
theoretically use the bearing from #1 to fix this, we never will, so
someone (that same mythical someone) might want to make sure that the
machine can be booted with a single RP04 present.

No, the fan is bad. It appears to work now because I bashed it on the floor
a few times to get it to work long enough so that Dave could fix up the
filesystem. The supply is fine.

I've been too busy to worry about this. I should have the required few
minutes this weekend though. I would however prefer that we get a new fan
from Lester so that I don't have to raid speech's spares. They are hard
to get from anywhere else because they are 208v, not 125. So if someone
sees Lester please ask him to bring a couple by (we should have a spare).
If he can just do it, great, but if not we will have to take up a
collection to pay for them I guess.

I thought it was my shiny new Apollo tht was doin it, so I connected ths here

But the modem woks fine when talking to other machines.  Thus, e conclude, it

More seriously, if anybody knows where we can get a decent terminal with

could get a pdp-11 programmer to tell 11DDT about DH-11 lines, maybe that

without getting a 10 ERR,ADR=0 error.  so i called Alan, and he suggested
this and that, none of which, alas, helped.  so i called Moon (mightiest of

Alan, and a few others also, none of which, alas, helped.  then did Moon
swear a mighty oath that he would swing by on his way home and see what
could be seen.  Nor did Moon break his oath, for soon he appeared, saying
"What is all this lossage?"  And Moon called for a voltmeter, with which to
check the power supplies on memory C, and he found them deficient, and Moon
called for paper for the Shitty33, that he might converse with the 11.  And
Moon also called for the KL to perform various highly unlikely and
improbable acts, for its behavior was not to his liking.  And Moon, who is
the mightiest of the mighty, swore many another mighty oath at that time,
cursing the decrepitude of the KL and its LA120.  Then did Moon find that,
despite his might, in his current state of weariness he had not the power
to raise the KL from its trance by the laying on of hands.  So Moon slunk
off in disgust and exhaustion, oh Best Beloved, leaving the KL to wait for
future salvation.

[ I removed Log-Service-Call@XX from the Recipients of this message,
  because I wasn't sure of the protocol for using it. ]

OK, it is possible that all of the bits in MC's filesystem were recovered
from today's disaster.  It appears that many of the blocks written on that
pack by MC's drive this weekend are marginal, but they are readable by the
salvager if it tries hard enough.  

There is some slight question as to the integrity of the data in those
blocks, since we did have to reconstruct a couple of blocks in the
filesystem itself.  It may be that when MC comes back up, we will find that
COMSAT's queue files are damaged.  I estimate the probability of this to be
rather low actually.

I have made a duplicate of MC's pack onto a fresh pack.  (The old pack was
named "MX001", I christened the new pack "MX002".)  Both packs are on the
same shelf in the disk pack cabinet next to the window behind AI and OZ.
The new pack will probably function better than the old because even though
you get exactly the same data (be it good or bad) when you read it, you
don't have to work as hard to get it since its blocks are all written
properly.  If there is any question as to the ancestry of this new pack, we
can always reformat the old pack and copy the data back...

As to the problems with MC's drive itself, it looks to me like the problem
should be easy for anyone with a knowledge of RP06's to fix.  When ITS was
running this weekend, -all- of the disk errors signaled the same error bit
(the "phase-locked ossillator (sic) unsafe" bit, says my crufty DEC
documentation), and it sounds to me like the diagnostics that JTW and SRA
got running were also reporting a consistent failure.  I have my doubts
about the competence of whoever it was who showed up from DEC this weekend,
it seems a shame you had to use up all your MC maintenence money that way.
(By the way:  The drive -is- correctly grounded to the processor, and I
find it highly unlikey that the ITS disk pack or the ITS operating system
could be the cause of something with a name like "phase-locked oscillator
unsafe"!)

If I were you, I would not mount either of those ITS packs in that drive
again unless you are very certain that the problem is fixed.

    I just spent five minutes looking at the DISK code.  Based on that
    wealth of experience, it appears to me that if I were to bring up the KS
    with UNSAFE+1 JFCL'd out, it would stop doing a BUGPAUSE every hour or
    so.

    Somebody tell me why I shouldn't do this, before I wear out the $P keys
    on the KS's console....

The idea was that if the disk goes unsafe, is reset, and goes unsafe
again within one second, it is probably about to explode and the fire
department should be called.  It looks like the code jumps to UNSAFE
for a lot of different reasons, not all of which are the drive going
unsafe.  The drive also goes unsafe for a lot of different reasons,
some of more consequence than others.

I agree that if you JFCL out the BUGPAUSE it won't do it any more, so if
you think this won't do irreparable harm to the disk, go ahead.

Subject: KS and disk

Ok, so we finally got somebody from DEC in, he stayed for three hours,
we owe them $411.  I have the customer's copy of the bill, the other
copy will be delivered through the usual mechanism (hand carry by
Lester) so that the appropriate PO can get filled out by somebody who
knows what to put in all the little boxes.

The problem is not fixed.  MC does not crash as a direct result of the
disk errors anymore.  Instead, it crashes after it gets enough
non-fatal disk errors.  I suppose we could increment the threshold
value for "too many disk errors" as a stopgap.

Interestingly enough, AI started having similar errors today (except
that the PLO bit isn't on for AI's errors).  The F-S guy suggested we
check that all those disks are grounded to the correct processors
(AI's disks to AI, MC's to MC, etc).

When I mentioned that the PLO Unsafe bit that comes up occasionally
(and is now coming up consistantly in the nonfatal errors on MC), our
F-S guy immediately dove into the guts and found a cable that wasn't
seated properly.  He fixed that, which is (I think) what changed the
errors from fatal to nonfatal.

The problem appears to be somewhat interrmittant; I saw him run this
diagnostic that causes the drive to break dance across the floor.
Sometimes it failed, sometimes it didn't.  For a while we thought the
MC pack might be bad, but the evidence wasn't conclusive.

We were somewhat hampered by the fact that the worst of these errors
only seem to come up on the ITS pack where the normal DEC diagnositic
tools aren't available.  Some ITS wizard should take a look at the new
set of error bits and disk addresses (in particuar the latter, our F-S
guy wasn't able to spot any pattern in the addresses because he's used
to surface-cylinder numbers).

One theory he came up with is that there's a head on that drive that's
gone slightly out of alignment.  He theorizes that the ITS code might
be less tolerant of these errors than Twenex, which is why ITS crashes
when Twenex just types obnoxious messages on the console.

At the end of three hours we decided that we needed more information
and that we'd be wasting our money having him stay around any longer.
Current status is that MC is up except when it isnt'; it needs
rebooting a lot.

We have a bunch of options.

One is to pay a head reallignment job and see if that fixes it.

Another is to format up a new MC pack with the current (possibly
misaligned) head configuration and run off that for a while if it
works.  This might be the best option, since the Twenex code seems to
be able to cope with the current head alignment.  This also covers the
possiblility of the MC pack being bad. 

Another option would be to bring up JTW's MIT rel5 Twenex pack (as
opposed to the vanilla DEC rel4 Alan and I were running before) and
see if SPEAR's ANALYZE functions can spot any patterns that us humans
missed.  I'd do this right now except that I want to let the mail
queues drain for a while (which was why I decided to pay the surcharge
for weekend service).  We haven't run twenex since he reseated those
cables for the PLO problem, so it is possible that twenex would be
happy now.  I doubt it, though, since the PLO bit is still coming up
on MC and is not coming up on AI.

Another option is to swap drives with MD so that we can put off
spending any more money on MC for a while.  This might be worth
keeping in mind, since we don't want Mike Dertuzos to withdraw his
blessing (such as it is) from this project.

Suggestions?  I'm not going to be around much for the next week or so,
somebody else might want to take over nursing our ailing puppy along.

Well, here's what's happened so far.  Alan extracted the error bits
from the crash dumps, and looked them up.  One is a generic unsafe
bit, one is a "missed transfer" bit, and one (which is only on in one
of the two dumps) is this hairy thing involving "loss of sync in the
read/write phase locked oscillator".  This last one rang a bell in the
mind of DPH, who said he thought we had had problems like that when
the KS was first delivered, but that the problem had gone away of its
own accord so nobody had ever done anything about it.

Then the F-S guy called and seemed somewhat reluctant to come out here
anytime soon (he has contract customers in the queue, and they get
priority).  I described the bits to him and he suggested we try
another pack in the drive.  So we dug out one of our two KS RED packs
and spun that up.  We brought that pack up running twenex, I broke
into OPERATOR, and started doing simple disk I/O (running a batch job
that submitted itself, typed out a file, then exited).  We got
"problem on device" errors out the wazzoo, so it's not the MC pack.

I managed to get a long form listing of the massbus error reports
(from the syserr log) typed out on the console.  Don't mean squat to
me but should be helpful to the F-S creature if s/he ever shows up.
The reporting tool is the old SYSERR program, which is missing the
analysis capabilities of the later SPEAR program.  So all I could get
was the raw data.

At this point I'm waiting to hear from F-S, who claimed they'd call
back sometime tonight when they knew if they'd be here anytime soon.

If there's anybody who can read Massbus error bits, we've got oodles
and oodles of them for you....

    I walked away from the console too soon.  It only stayed up for ten
    minutes.

    I am leaving it down so as not to munch the filesystem too much by
    multiple crashes.

ITS doesn't munch the file system when it crashes.  If you meant that
you were worried about the drive destroying the pack, I hope you spun
it down.

(Actually, there is a slight risk of munching the file system in 1-drive
systems, such as MC, since there is no backup copy of the directories in
1-drive systems.  You only lose if the disk aborts a directory write
while it's half-written, and then the system crashes before it can
complete the write, and it wasn't the MFD (which is reconstructable).
Then you might lose all the files in that user directory.  The only time
I've ever seen anything like this was when the disk controller was
destroying data that passed through it without any error indication;
that actually creamed a multi-drive system since it often destroyed the
backup copies the same way.  The software should have been smarter (and
slower).)

    Ideas, other than calling DEC and paying for a visit?

I see you called DEC.  But the first thing to do would to be get the values
of the error registers in the drive and look them up in the incredibly
lousy drive documentation to find out what caused the unsafe light to light;
there are a dozen or so different things that can do it.

I came in, found the KS's RP06 still spinning with its UNSAFE light on
(ITS had BUGHLT'd, of course).  Saw no obvious gouges in pack, no
powdered medium in drive.  Did find lint on the foam rubber strip
around the top of the pack well.

Figuring we had nothing to lose, I powercycled the drive, spun it back
up, rebooted.  Seems to be running ok.

Tyrone theorizes that some seek went too far or something like that.
Perhaps we should have somebody check this drive out?  Keep in mind
that it's not on contract.  I'm not sure which is cheaper, PM or CM,
under the circumstances.

    Gee, I dunno.  I see PALX loading 375 bytes at 11332, and the first 3 words
    of that data are correct.  After remembering that in the stupid pdp11 format
    the byte counts are off by 6, I realize that this ends at the end of IBOMSG,
    which is an odd-length thing.  The PALX binary hasn't been changed in almost
    four years.  On the other hand, the only PALX source is two years and three
    versions newer.  I tried assembling and using that PALX but it doesn't make
    any difference.  Barf.

    Here's a procedure that seems to work:

    pdp11^K
    :load sra;ioelev bin
    :adump sra;ioelev nbin
    ^Z
    :pcnvrt sra;ioelev nbin

    I don't remember if we used to have to go through this song and dance.
    As far as I remember, which is hardly at all, the output from PALX
    used to work..

The above is all nonsense.  Sorry about that.

I remembered the correct procedure, which is to use 11STNK to load IOELEV
and 11DDT together, then send the output to the front-end file system.
I think you use 11DDT 8K on the MX-DL machine and 11DDT 16K on the MX-FE
machine.  There is probably documentation or command files in the MX:KLDCP;
directory, but I can't get to that machine right now.

It seems to work.  This one was produced using Moon's suggestion
(running the PALX output through TS PDP11 to keep PCNVRT from
barfing).  The A11 file is much shorter than either of the previous
ones I found in the FE's filesystem.  Since the code is running on the
11 as I type this, that extra space pretty much has to be the symbol
table (but if the dialups don't work anymore, you know why...).

I also figured out how to produce a new @ BOOT11, so the last vestiges
of the name swap (MX-MC) should disappear soon.

So much for archeology.

Because I could never remember that you had to launch the Dover spooler on

that will do the launching automatically.

(You will recall the problem is that the demon cannot be launched directly,
because it uses the PK1: device, which doesn't exist on the new MC.  Thus
it needs a translation added (PK1: => DSK:) before it can run.)

I assembled and installed a new version of IOELEV for the KL.  The
only change is that it now knows that its name has changed (no longer
tells you you are connected to MC).  I'll change the namespace
sometime soon if there aren't any problems with this.

While I was installing this silliness, I reorganized the IOELEV
binaries.  KL Console-11 binaries are (as before) in IOELEV nnnBIN
with IOELEV BIN as a link to the latest version (now IOELEV 431BIN).
The AI-Chaos-11 binaries are now in IOELEV nnnAI with a link from
IOELEV AIBIN to the latest version (IOELEV 430AI, the one where I made
subnet six the "primary" address of AI-11 so dover spooling would work
better).

I don't expect any problems.  Next person who cold boots the KL please
tell me what happens (if no problems, tell me that).

moon came by this evening to help alan zero MX's memory, and while he was
here he looked at its tape drive, which for the record is a TU40. someone
(JTW?) had already dived into the drive's innards and removed a rubber belt
which was in very bad shape.  replacing the belt made loading tapes almost
work -- until the belt popped off its wheels due to its advanced
decrepitude. 
    so moon's diagnosis is that we need a new Vacuum Pump Belt -- that was
the only designation we found in the manual, no part number (though perhaps
by now DEC has assigned part numbers to pieces of TU40s; our manual is
after all 10 years old). we can install it ourselves, so all we need is to
get our hands on the part.
    is there one of these around somewhere? if not, can we arrange to order
one -- it should be quite cheap (alan is threatening to pay for it himself
if LCS won't, and he's a semi-starving grad student...).

Sounds like a mechanical problem.  I can't remember if these symptoms
are what happens when the two little rubber belts inside break or
pop off.  I think we have a maintenance manual for this tape drive,
unless it's been lost, so maybe someone could take a look.  I might
do it, but probably won't have time for a week or so.  Having DEC
fix it sounds like a good investment in preserving all that information
on backup tape, presuming they won't "fix" it the way they "fixed"
MX's RP04 #1 (taking it away and bringing in a broken one to replace it).

this evening i discovered that MX's tape drive is broken. syndrome:
when trying to load a tape, it does wind it onto the take-up reel, but
does not suck it down into the vacuum columns. i tried cleaning the
beast, which can't have hurt (it was FILTHY), but didn't help. now
what? does anyone understand enough about TU-whatever-it-is-s to
fiddle with its innards? can we (beg, plead) pay to have dec frob it?
some progress has been made in the old-MC-tapes preservation movement
-- Alan has copied the most recent several GFR tapes onto 9track
1600bpi -- but there are still large amounts of stuff only on 7track
which we could greatly profit from having available (having the
opportunity to copy to the more readable format).

The KL's RP04 unit #1 may have bitten the dust.  It can no longer read its

Say, what ever happened about amateur maintenance for the KL?  (People to

    I deconfigured the ampex the other day, basically because I was screwing around.
    In particular, I wanted to try out running with 4-way interleaving, which at
    that time I thought the ampex couldn't do because some of the processor's
    ports were broken (JNC later said he thinks this is not true. Experiments 
    to follow, maybe.)

The Ampex has only 2 banks, so it certainly can't give higher performance with
4-way interleave than with 2-way.  Where the other two banks should be is just
air, because Joel didn't want to spend that much money.  I don't know about the
ports being broken, but it wouldn't surprise me one bit.  The port transceivers
on the Ampex are excrement.

    Also, I was running memory tests the other day when I was frobbing with
    the kludge. The ampex seems to get the occasional parity error during
    hard use - nothing horrible. On the other hand the MH10 that is marked
    as being bad ran OK at that point. Perhaps the problem was the tape
    DF10 port all along.

Could be.

    Anyway, it seems we have a meg of good MH10 memory, at least from the
    processor's point of view. One could even run 4-way interleaved and speed
    things up a bit, if one remembered to type J KLINI4 instead of J KLINIT,
    which runs 2-way. If the ampex can indeed do 4-way OK I will probably
    turn it back on and change the default. 

    Does anyone think the machine -needs- more than 1M of memory with the
    use it is getting these days?

Well, it needs more than 1M less than AI needs more than 0.5M.  But why not
use it if it's there?  I measured the performance difference between 2-way
and 4-way interleave once (running Macsyma I guess) and it was tiny.

The KL is now running a COMSAT configured as if it were a chaos-only
machine.  It uses MC (Chaos 3131) as its gateway.

This will load the KS a little more for outgoing net traffic, but will
do the right thing for headers (we are -not- going to get the NIC to
put MX in the tables before the poor thing melts down) and is probably
the right thing politically anyway, since it cuts down on the amount
of (unapproved) traffic through IMP port 1/6.

I haven't messed with FTPS or anything like that, so anybody who knows
enough to talk to 10.1.0.6 will still win.

I copied what I thought were the last 2 MC-KL GFR tapes (but later I found
four newer ones out of order on the tape rack) onto 9-track tape, using
the TCOPY routine in MX:MOON;TS ND.  I had the good luck to encounter a
tape with an irrecoverable error in it, so I know the error recovery routine
works.

We should proceed copying gradually older tapes as time permits.  I used
a tape kindly donated by the AI Lab.  LCS should come up with the tapes for
this.  After the copy is finished, they can do whatever they want with the
old 7-track tapes (I would save them for a while).

I'm putting the newly copied GFR tapes onto the tape rack near MC-KL,
on the opposite side from the old GFR tapes.  This way anyone who wants
to copy tapes can tell which tapes someone else has copied.  I am copying
two 7-track tapes onto each 9-track tape to economize on tapes and floor
space for storing them.

Well, the routine for copying two tapes onto one still has a bug
in it (it writes a logical eot at the end of the first tape, so
you can't get to the copy of the second tape).  I'll fix that when
I have time to test it, in the meantime copy one tape per 9-track

I copied what I thought were the last 2 MC-KL GFR tapes (but later I found
four newer ones out of order on the tape rack) onto 9-track tape, using
the TCOPY routine in MX:MOON;TS ND.  I had the good luck to encounter a
tape with an irrecoverable error in it, so I know the error recovery routine
works.

We should proceed copying gradually older tapes as time permits.  I used
a tape kindly donated by the AI Lab.  LCS should come up with the tapes for
this.  After the copy is finished, they can do whatever they want with the
old 7-track tapes (I would save them for a while).

I'm putting the newly copied GFR tapes onto the tape rack near MC-KL,
on the opposite side from the old GFR tapes.  This way anyone who wants
to copy tapes can tell which tapes someone else has copied.  I am copying
two 7-track tapes onto each 9-track tape to economize on tapes and floor
space for storing them.

Moon found a bad power supply in the Kludge. I installed a new one, and
things seem OK for now.

Leaving us with:
 KL running OK with 1Meg of MH memory, ampex off.
 RH10 seems OK, survived an hour of reliability diags fine.
 RP04 #1 can be made to reliably screw up trying to write and
  read back worst-case data patterns...
 Not really sure if you can use the tape without causing parity errors..

I made some minor edits to the PWORD sources with the intent that we would
bring PWORD up on the KS since it becomes MC tomorrow morning.
Unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to make an empty PWORD database.

I guess we'll just run DDT on both the KL and the KS until someone figures
this out.

I changed the source to look for the database in the same place on both the
KL and the KS.  This means that you have to -move- the database on the KL
before installing a new PWORD there.  The database wants to live in the
same place so that you don't need a complicated algorithm based on cpu type
to figure out where the database is.  You Grok?

Well, there wasn't anything wrong with MC's processor after all.  No
irreplaceable processor boards were lost.  The single -new- problem is that
unit #2 is now exhibiting one of the canonical RP04 lossages: it is unable
to fully retract its cleaning brushes.  This can be fixed by someone who
knows what they are doing in about 5 minutes.  All we have to do is find
someone like that.

Until unit #2 gets fixed, Moon and I figured we would simply move pack 1
from unit #2 to unit #1, and take pack 13 (SECOND) off-line.  You may
recall that unit #1 is the one DEC replaced last month because they
couldn't fix the old unit #1.  Since then I have been warning people not to
create new files on pack 13 because I was under the impression that it had
been mis-formatted by the old drive.  Well, I was wrong, and tonight we
learned just how wrong in a slightly painful way.

After ITS had run for an hour or so, it filled pack 0 up to a point where
it thought it might be a good idea to switch to creating files on pack 1
for a while.  At this point Alan learns that what DEC had convinced him of
last month was in fact not true.  Unit #1 really -is- still broken.  It can
read files just fine, but something like one out of every hundred blocks it
writes are unreadable.  So now we have a few files on pack 1 that contain
locked and unreadable blocks, and probably a few more that are unreadable
that ITS hasn't discovered yet.  The most important known casualty is 
.MAIL.; LISTS   MSGS (COMSAT's database of queued mail).

This is a familiar story these days.  DEC can't fix it, so your filesystem
gets gubble written in it.  Fortunately, the ITS filesystem is built from
pretty stern stuff, so although we might lose a file or two, the whole
thing is much less likely to crumble around our ears.

So here is where we stand:  MC's filesystem contains a couple of bruises,
but nothing severe.  However we can't really run MC untill one of the
drives gets fixed (unit #2 should be easy, as I said before) without
risking further damage to the filesystem.  A few cycles from a COMSAT
wizard will be required to either fix its database and get COMSAT running
again, or to at least rescue the mail currently trapped in its queue (I can
explain the nature of the lossage further in person).  The most important
thing we can get from MC right now is to empty the last valuable stuff from
its filesystem, and to use it to copy 7 track tapes.  I know how we can
safely accomplish both of these tasks using the 1.5 RP04's we have left,
but I would rather not get into that here, and I hope we won't need to.

I would recommend that the IMP reconfiguration take place as soon as
possible so that we can bring the MC KS online.

We can't really make the KS be MC until Zvona finishes with the great
mailing list migration.  He estimated to me today that he had about 8 hours
work to go, but he was handicapped by not having access to the mailing
lists file on MC.  Fortunately while MC was up Penny grabbed a copy, so now
AI:.MAIL.;.MCNEW NAMES contains a copy of the NAMES file currently on the
KL.  (We should give Zvona a medal when he finishes this job.  (Zvona:  if
you need any more files from the KL, I'll be happy to get them back for
you!))

Question:  We are going to need a mess of tapes for copying MC's GFR tapes
to 9-track tapes and also for doing a last full dump to 9-track (and
perhaps copying a couple more older full dumps to 9-track).  How does one
go about obtaining such large numbers of tapes?  Who's going to pay for it?
If I truck on down to the stock room and ask for 100 reels of tape, I
presume they will want some kind of coherent story about who should be
charged for it...

    I don't understand why ``of course,'' but presumably you have the
    situation under control.

``of course'' because I thought we had talked about that particular case in
person the other day.  Perhap that was someone else I had that conversation
with.

    We should make up a list of what needs to be done before the flag day,
    if there is more than a couple things.  I should be done with mailing
    lists and INQUIR by Tuesday.

    Maybe it would be better to phase it?  Stage one changes the primary
    name of KL to KL, retaining the secondary name MC.  That lets anything
    break that depends on all KLs having a primary name MC.  Stage two
    moves the name MC to KS, which keeps KS as primary name.  That lets
    things break that depend on MC being a KL.  Stage three makes MC the
    primary name for KS and possibly moves the name MX to KL....

I have always imagined that the swap happens as follows:  One day we come
in and find that MC/KL no longer has a network connection because the
coolies from BBN have finally converted the IMP port.  At this moment we go
and make the final edits to the ITS sources that officially swap the names
and assemble the first MC/KS and KL/MX systems.  Then we take down both the
KL and the KS.

Now it would be nice if it this point we can get the host tables to change
to reflect the new names and Chaosnet addresses while both machines are
down.  Dream on.

We leave KL/MX down until we get everything else working since the
important goal is to keep "MC" working.  We bring up MC/KS, and we spend
the rest of the day putting out the minor fires that this sets.  Initially
the only mail going through MC/KS is coming in from the Internet, but
gradually as more people pick up the new Chaosnet address the mail load
picks up.

When we are happy that MC/KS works, then at our leisure we can bring up
KL/MX.

MC:MOON;TS ND was able to copy a couple of MC GFR tapes onto a 9-track,
1600 bpi tape on Gutenberg's drive.  Beware: that's another hardware/Unix
combination that likes to go into 6250 bpi when you're not looking.  ITS
dump tapes don't work at 6250 bpi.

The tape copying is pretty fast.  To use it, start up ND and use the
REMOTE command to specify your tape server.  Then hit c-G and type
TCOPYG and answer the questions.  You can copy two 800 bpi tapes onto
each 1600 bpi tape.

I fixed a couple of things in the program and reassembled after I was
done testing it, and didn't retest, but I don't think I broke anything.
The only thing I haven't tested is recovery from tape errors, because
I wasn't able to find any unreadable tapes to copy from.  It's supposed
to print an error message and copy whatever bad data it gets onto the
output tape where it will masquerade as good data, but I don't know
whether it works.

    The dump was completed..the drive survived..

    PS: I was told that LNS have some 7/9 track drives that can run with the tape
    controler that is now on MC. Can the ITS software hack it??

The ITS software can certainly handle 9-track drives on TM10 controllers, since
that's what DM had.  That would let us dump MC onto 9-track tape.  It wouldn't
give us a way to recover the contents of all those 7-track dumps lying around
after MC dies, which is the goal that would really be good to achieve.

    They are suppose to have  about eight drives (working), that are gathering 
    dust and space..

I guess this should be investigated.

    I believe we could also hook one of these up to a KS.

There are no tape drives that are capable of hooking -both- to MC and to a KS.

    I will have the machine in standalone mode most of the day, to do last official
    full dump..The tape drive is not expected to survive the 50+ tapes that it takes
    (Sez DEC...).We shall see..Its still on service...any other problems WE should
    let DEC know/fix????

If the RP04 that has the SECOND: pack on it is still broken such that it gets a lot
of read errors, and DEC is not going to fix it, you are probably better off taking
it offline before doing the dump, so as not to be hassled by lots of disk errors.

We're going to try to get a full dump onto 9-track tape soon, but you should go ahead
and do the 7-track full dump anyway.

    At least I think that's what it is; MC had been getting them for the past
    8 hours or so.  Dumped to CRASH URET2 if anyone cares
    (bugpc/ caia uret2+2 $Q-1/ pushj p,bugnil)

Has nothing to do with parity errors.  This is one of the three or four
canonical software bugs.  Something in the RENAME system call fails to
unlock all of its locks.  The process of launching a comsat seems to tickle
it every few months.

    Also, the GW tables are filling up every five or ten minutes rather
    than every hour or so.  Isn't that a bug, or am I just confused?

No real problem.  Ignore it.

    deleted the old archives (maybe they just rename them, I didn't check).

They renamed them:  MC:KSC;BUGTCP MAIL -> MC:KSC;BUGTCP OMAIL

    See if you can find them; if not, I'll forward you a set.

I fixed the problem that caused these to com out so damned often, MC may
not get the fix ever, since we might not ever assemble another ITS for MC.

Well, the new RP04 on MC only seems to be half of an RP04.  It seems
perfectly capable of reading the files off of our old pack, but new files
we create there usually get hard ECC errors when you read them back.
Tonight I tried formatting a fresh pack on that drive, hoping that this was
just some kind of head alignment prroblem.  No such luck.  The newly
formatted pack gets hard errors on every cylinder.

I have left the old pack on line because it lets users get at their old
files (and it is hard for a user to accidentally create a file there), not
because I think this drive is fixed.

    When I dial x6985, I am getting a connection which responds to my
    carriage return with the standard "Connected to MC.", but then it
    fails to give me a HACTRN.  C-Z has no effect.

    I notice that *nobody* is logged in from a dialup.  This seems like it
    might be related.

No, its only T10.  I'm using T11 right now now problem.  Probably nobody is
using a dialup because they all dial the number CPH did, which is the base
of the hunt group, and when it doesn't work they hang up again so that the
broken line will shaft the next user.  Doesn't occur to many people to try
dialing 6986...

SYSMSG shows that ITS timed out waiting for the 11 to acknowledge a
character it sent to T10.  (I guess somebody dropped an interrupt.)  This
leaves ITS confused about the state of that TTY.  Setting the right
variable in ITS (TTYOAC+10/ -1) unwedged it.  (I finished sending this mail
from T10.)

    ITS took a page fault.  Look in CRASS PAGFLT if you care.

Specifically, ITS took a page fault running in the scheduler.  It thought
it was looking at somebody's USTP bits, but U contains gubbish, and it
looks like the hardware pagetable must have contained some kind of a joke
as well.  I am tempted to agree with you that this was the result of
glitch.  (That must be what you think since you mailed this to Poor-MC,
right?)

    PS: Someone seems to have deleted the pooor-mc alias.

I don't think it ever really had that name, at least not for long.  I
suggested it, but I think somebody corrected my joke thinking it was a typo
almost instantly.

    MC died again.  It printed the error "TTY: OUTPUT BUFFER POINTER PAST
    END OF BUFFER".  I saved it to CRASH;CRASH TTYOU1.  When I reloaded
    XITS and g'd it, the memory bay lights flashed for a while and
    nothing else happened.  I waited a minute or so, raised switch zero
    and reloaded it; it then seemed happy.

    By the way, is this mailing list the place to send these reports or
    should I just write them in the log?

I think the idea behind Poor-MC was for hardware related problems.  If you
think a crash was clearly caused by hardware, Poor-MC is the place.  If you
can't tell, send mail to Bug-ITS.  In either case write something in the
log.  In this case I happen to know that this is one of the known software
bugs in ITS, perhaps someday somebody will figure out how this happens.
(If you see it again, don't bother to take a crash dump of it, we have
plenty of this one!)

The other wierd thing that happend to you, where ITS comes up but nothing
gets printed on the system console, is something I have seen before, but I
haven't the slightest idea what causes it.  The console 11 must get
confused or something given that the salvager manages to run without error,
yet it types nothing out!

It complained about too many parity errors.  I warm booted it and it

Looks like reloading the console 11 fixed the hangup detection problem.  I
guess we can stop worrying about broken hardware.

Sometime in the last couple of days the console 11 (the one that acts as a
front end for the vadic lines) has stopped detecting hangups.  The symptoms
are that when you dial up to MC and type CR you do -not- get the "Connected
to MC" message, instead you have to type ^Z, because you are already
connected to MC.  You thus lose your chance to do autospeeding if want to
talk something other than 1200 baud.  Furthermore, ITS has not cleared the
terminal type for the line you are using (the 11 never told it the last guy
hung up the phone), so it will be sending inappropriate display codes to
your terminal.

The next person to reload the system should be sure to reload the console
11 on the theory that it is running corrupted software.  If this doesn't
work, then we will have to assume it is busted hardware.

When I came upstairs to reboot MC I discovered that the system console
had been cunningly set up so that it printed its messages on paper
that had been previously typed on.  Note on the blank side of such
paper, mind you, but on the pre-written on side.  I therefore have no
idea at all why the machine crashed.  I went and found some clean
paper which the console is now using.

The salvager also deleted the empty directories MBR and LND.

I was around early Wednsday morning, and the indicated AMPEX memory
was offline then.  I went home when DEC took the system down for PM.

    I guess we just have to assume that pinheads come in in the
    middle of the night and randomly play with the switches on our machines.

Probably at least every other week.

Being in a mood that makes me easy to annoy, I was very annoyed to find
that: despite the fact that there was a system message on MC saying that
1/2 of the ampex was off-line, and despite the fact that there was a note
the MC's Very Small Bulletin Board about memory being offline, and despite
the fact that I sent mail to this mailing list, nevertheless all of the
ampex memory is currently online.  How long has this been true I wonder?
Did whoever do this have a good reason for not turning interleaving in the
Ampex back on when the re-enabled that memory?  Why didn't they remove the
now-erroneous note from the VSBB?  Why didn't they take down the system
message?  I guess we just have to assume that pinheads come in in the
middle of the night and randomly play with the switches on our machines.

    I took sector 0 of the Ampex offline as the parity errors got to bad to put
    up with.  I take it that since the errors had moved from sector 1 to sector
    0 thaat someone (TY?) has been swapping boards in there?  None of the
    module parity error lights were lit, perhaps this means that the light on
    the module in question is burned out.

Maybe the modules are fine and the problem is with getting the data between
the core modules and the cpu, thus fingering the memory bus interface in the
cpu (which I have never known to break), the memory bus cables (which don't
break very often), the memory bus transceiver cards in the ampex (which are
pieces of shit that always break), and the controller in the ampex (also a
piece of shit, but as far as I know has never broken).  The errors might be
concentrated in a particular sector if the processor and the ampex are both
interleaved; in that case the even addresses would all be on a particular
pair of the 4 processor-memory busses, would go through a particular set of
transceivers, and would all end up in sector 0.  The odd addresses would go
through different transceivers and end up in sector 1.

Besides being pieces of garbage in their own right, the transceiver cards
have a manual adjustment with (as I recall) conflicting documentation about
what you're supposed to adjust it to, plus sensitivity to power supply problems.

Of course, just about ANYTHING could happen as the result of a single
changed bit.  The fact that this happened twice makes me mildly
suspicious, but I really have no clue.  This is a pretty basic
routine that gets invoked continuously, and has never barfed before
to my knowledge.  Most likely something clobbered some portion
of the memory.  If you had both dumps available, I would suggest
looking at the network connections with PEEK's autopsy mode to see
if there is anything in common.

    MC started crashing with parity errors in MH10-D (bank 0) today, and
    TY thinks that the problem is related to the tape channel, since
    whenever DUMP gets round to touching the tape, the system dies.
    So, he's calling in DEC to run diagnostics on the memories and DF10.

DDQCB on our disk is pretty good for checking for this problem.  Don't
forget to write-protect the disks when running it, otherwise it may write
on them!  You can get it to write and read a tape and tell you what bad
data were written into memory by the tape controller.

(Who else would ever bring MC up after it crashes?  I get tired of sending
these notes to all of Bug-ITS...  Perhaps we should make a Pooor-MC mailing
list?)

I reconfigured MC's memory as follows:

	   0 -    777777  MH10-D
	1,,0 - 4,,777777  Ampex (both sectors)
	5,,0 - 5,,777777  MH10-C
	6,,0 - 6,,777777  MH10-B
	7,,0 - 7,,777777  MH10-A

This puts the system itself running in MH10-D which hasn't seen parity
errors in quite some time.  Also if I understand the way ITS allocates
memory this will tend to keep users out of the Ampex, so perhaps its parity
errors will be less fatal.  Finally, if the DL10 is really writing bad
parity, this should make them move to a different place so we can see.

(Probably I should have put the boxes A,B,C in the other order since for a
while we thought A might have been broken, but its too late now.)
