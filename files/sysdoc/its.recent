I started on a '10 simulator, but never wrote the 36 bit math needed.
If you figure a 10 times performance hit a DS3100 or a SPARC might
yield performance at the KA/KS level.

Reply-To: jinx@zurich.ai.mit.edu

I think that the idea of a PDP-10 simulator running on a fast Unix box
is pretty funny, but would be a very cool hack.  Writing such a
simulator (except IO instructions) is straight-forward, but changing
ITS to do virtual IO would probably be far more painful.  It may also
require a fair amount of hacking from a very small group of people
(Alan, Moon,...), and that may not be reasonable.

I would be interested in getting a discussion going on the future of
ITS.  This would be open to any kind of strange ideas, from running 
it on existing KS-10 hardware (at MIT or not) to building a PDP-10
software simulator that can run on existing and/or future cpus, like
MIPS chips, etc.  In short, before these machines go away, and all of
the ITS knowledgable people too far away, lets talk about this stuff.

Another point is that INFO-ITS and KS-OWNERS lists should continue to
live after the ITS systems go into hibernation so that advances in the 
ITS state-of-the-art can be announced and discussed.

Comments, etc?

I'm sorry to announce that we're going to shut down the ITS machines at
MIT.  As we plan for the final shutdown, the file AI:SYS;GOOD BYE will be
constantly updated to contain the current plans.  What follows is the
current contents of that file, and it pretty much explain the situation:

-------

Well, the time has finally arrived to shut down the ITS machines for the
last time.  The hardware is getting old, and the amount of maintenance
required to keep things running is getting out of hand.  We've been losing
ground at an accelerating rate for the last year.

The current plan is to turn AI and MC off for good sometime around the end
of May.  We plan to take a snapshot of AI and MC's filesystem sometime
before the final shutdown and to keep this snapshot available on some other
file server for a couple of months.  People who have a large number of
files to evacuate, but who lack efficient network access to AI and MC, are
encouraged to simply wait until after this snapshot becomes available.

AI's second RP06 (SECOND:) will be fixed soon to make it easier for people
to evacuate themselves.

Files on ITS backup tapes will be unavailable until someone writes the
program to read them.  Before the shutdown, modest file retrieval requests
(mail to FILE-R@AI) will be considered.  Extensive or complicated retrieval
requests will have to wait until after the dust settles after the shutdown.
Our judgment on these matters will be final.  Sorry.

All mailing lists will have to be moved elsewhere.  If you maintain a
mailing list on AI or MC, you can save us some trouble by moving your
mailing list yourself as soon as possible.  We'll try and do something
responsible about those important lists that don't have obvious owners, but
don't count on us to save your mailing list for you -- we might decide to
just let it perish.

Please try not to pester us about the personal inconvenience this causes
you.  We don't have any suggestions about where you should read your mail
now, where you can keep your files, or where you can move your mailing
list, and we wish we knew of another PDP-10 that you could use.  (If you
-must- pester someone, send mail to DOOMSDAY@AI.)  We do appreciate your
loyalty to ITS during its lifetime at MIT.  Stop by sometime and we can
talk about the good old days when dinosaurs ruled the machine room.

As we continue to plan for doomsday, this file will be updated with the
latest news.

				- Alan

       asking for cookies, and had not been found, even after people searched

   discover the hardware hack in the system console.

   I wrote a cookie program for the PDP-8 at MIT's Weather Radar group when
   I worked there in the summer of 1975, based on the story I had heard.
   I wasn't aware of TS BEAR until much later, although I don't know when
   it was written or what inspiration its author (who I think was GLS) had.

I wrote TS BEAR after hearing an oral description of a similar
hack on (as I recall) Multics.  Richard Feynman was perhaps its
most famous victim (it was I who sicced it on him--blush).

OK, here's another one I heard about.  This one (I was told) happened
at MIT, back in the 70s (oooooeeeee-ooooo), on some big network type
machine.  At the same time every day, a message would appear on
people's terminals, saying "Give me a cookie".  And if they did
nothing, the machine would burp and kill their process or something.
Eventually someone, in response to that message, typed "cookie", and
the machine said "thanks" and continued working normally.  For the
remainder of the machine's lifetime, people would type "cookie" at the
same time every day and take it for granted that they had to do this.

While the machine was being dismantled, someone took a look inside and
found this circuit board hooked into the machine.  Guess what was
asking for cookies, and had not been found, even after people searched

So -- did this really happen, or are all of Seymour Papert's students
on drugs?  :-)

Subject: 25th Anniversary of 36 Bits
Keywords: 36-bits DEC-10 DEC-20 DECUS
Date: 5 Sep 89 17:05:12 GMT
Organization: MCC, Austin, TX

[The number of people who contributed to the recent discussion on
Digital's 36-bit architecture made it seem appropriate to post this
message here.  My apologies for straying from the main subject
matter.]

A special event will take place at the Fall DECUS Symposium in Anaheim,
California, November 6-10, 1989: The 25th Anniversary of 36-bit systems
will be celebrated.  In 1964, Digital announced the PDP-6.  Twenty-five
years later, the 36-bit architecture is still here serving a loyal
customer base.

The celebration will take place on the evening of Monday, November 6,
1989.  The usual DEC 10/20 Update Session will be held from 3-5 PM.
Last-minute announcements regarding Anniversary events will be made at
this session, as well as in the Monday edition of Update.Daily (the
Symposium newspaper).  A meeting room in one of the Symposium hotels
(Hilton or Marriott) will be made available for the anniversary
events, which include:

	-- 36-Bit JEOPARDY!
		In the tradition of the 36-bit Trivia Bowl held at the
		20th Anniversary celebration,  experts on the  history
		and folklore of  36-bit systems  will compete  against
		each other.  Come and match wits with them!

	-- Memorabilia Exhibit and Swap
		You are  encouraged to  bring old  manuals,  listings,
		pieces of  hardware  (e.g. KA  and/or  KI  consoles!),
		posters, buttons, tapes, and  any other items  related
		to 36-bit  systems  for  exhibiting  and/or  swapping.
		Table space will be made available.

	-- Anniversary Dinner 

		Dinner plans  are not  yet firm.   It will  either  be
		catered by the hotel  or we will  adjourn to a  nearby
		restaurant. 

	-- 36-Bit Magic & War Stories
		Following dinner we  will swap war  stories and  other
		legends of  36-bit  lore.   One of  the  most  popular
		events of  the 1984  celebration will  be repeated:  a
		reading of several infamous  SPR's (and their  equally
		infamous replies.)  Come prepared to share share  your
		favorite  stories.   Prizes  for  the  best  will   be
		awarded.

Note that these four events will NOT appear in the DECUS schedule
since they are not official DECUS functions (and therefore do not
require conference registration.)  If you are planning to attend any
of the 25th Anniversary events, please notify me as soon as possible,
since we need to get a reasonable estimate on the number of people to
expect.  (Dinner plans depend on this, so please try not to delay.)

	Phone:	   (512) 338-3430

This will also enable us to create a mailing list for any last minute
announcements regarding the events.  If you would like table space for
exhibits, please mention this.  Suggestions regarding dinner plans are
also welcome.  It may be difficult to find a reasonable restaurant
nearby that could handle this.  The 20th anniversary dinner was done
by the hotel at a cost of $36/person (what else?!).  Is this a
reasonable fee?  If not, let me know how much you would be willing to
pay.

This message is being sent to the TOPS-20 mailing list and the
comp.arch and comp.org.decus news groups.  Please redistribute as you
see fit and pass the word to other 36-bitters who may not otherwise
find out about this.

See you in Anaheim!

    The other day I saw a California licence plate that read "JRST 4" (I guess you
    can't get commas on licence plates...). Out of curiosity, who is the owner of
    this plate?

	    --Vince

Hmm.  I thought this was Geoff Goodfellow's, but SAIL:AIWORD.RF[UP,DOC]
tells me he has JFCL.

HIC got Massachusetts HLRZ (the PDP-10 instruction that implements
the "car" operation of Lisp); I believe this vehicle and plate is
still around in the possession of PGS.

I had FOOBAR in Nevada and later in Massachusetts; I still have
the physical plates from Nevada, though the vehicle which wore
both sets is long since deceased.

There used to be a rather extensive discussion of this stuff in the
jargon file(s), but it seems to have evaporated, except for the single
note about JFCL.

The other day I saw a California licence plate that read "JRST 4" (I guess you
can't get commas on licence plates...). Out of curiosity, who is the owner of
this plate?

So all of you that has bits and pices, bring it to the 9:th floor

"The time has come," said LCS,
    "MX at last must go.
Its day has gone.  We need that space
    Most urgently."  And so
Before we crate it, let us give
    A final cheerio.

Once there was a KL-10 called MIT-MC which belonged to the Macsyma
Consortium.  It provided Macsyma, the symbolic algebra system, to
researchers all over the world, and mail gatewaying and mailing list
support to a large fraction of the Arpanet.  Things continued in this
fashion from 1975 to 1983.

When the Macsyma Consortium dissolved in 1983, MC turned to providing
cycles for MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science, and continued supporting
much of the Arpanet's mail service.  But the machine itself was growing old
and cranky.  In 1986, the mail services were moved to a smaller, more
maintainable machine (a KS-10), and the name "MC" was moved with them.
But the KL-10 continued to run under the new name "MX".

Now the end has come.  MX was down cold for several months, and has only
been revived recently to copy some old 7-track tapes.  LCS can't keep MX
any longer -- it needs the space for other purposes.  So the KL is being
sent to the Home for Aged But Beloved PDP-10s; a crack team of hardware
hackers will arrive next week to dismantle it and take it back with them to
Sweden.

In celebration of this momentous event, we are holding a small farewell
gathering:
                         Friday, 16 September 1988

I heard of a pretty big Intelligent Tutoring Systems effort 
going on at UMass.  I have the paper at home if you want it.
They aren't really doing anything new, just applying AI to a 
new area.  The most interesting thing about the paper is that
they continually use the acronym ITS to describe their systems.

TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 both support 30-bit address spaces (although the KL
CPU only allows 23).  Having written a large program using 30-bit addressing,
I can assure you it isn't as kludgy as its detractors claim, and certainly a
lot cleaner than some of the current faddish architectures.

I'm sure some bright hacker could figure out how to convert ITS to 30-bit
addressing.

But the 18-bit address space is a lose.  Since you're making a new
chip or chip set anyway, why not double the word length?  36-bit
halfwords should keep people happy for a while.  We could have more
registers, too.

That sounds good.  I'm sure the ITS hackers in 2155 will be able to think
of something clever to solve the problem then.  TOPS-20's date format
dies at the last 1/3 second of Wednesday, 7 August 2576 GMT (here on the
west coast, just before 5PM PDT), so we have almost 589 years to worry
about that.

    I was quoted in a trade journal as saying that PANDA/TOPS-20
    will see the century tick.  What about ITS?  We're going to
    have to do something about that sixbit date format, you know!

(I intend to continue using ITS into retirement...)

The SIXBIT date format you are thinking of (from the .RDATE uuo) is for
simple programs that want the date in MM/DD/YY format.  I presume that on
January 1, 2000 those programs will want to print the date as 01/01/00, so
this isn't a problem.

There are two other date formats.  The .RYEAR uuo returns the year as an
18-bit quantity, so that will work for quite some time.  The other, more
common, date format is the one used by the filesystem, and by programs that
used the DATIME library; this is the format returned by the RQDATE system
call.  This format packs the year, less 1900, in a 7-bit field, so this
will last through 2027.  Since the bit to the left of the year field is
unused, we can easily expand this to last through 2155.

Probably the most we will have to do is fix a few user programs that have
the string "19" built into them.

are more ITS systems in operation (even excluding the part-time
systems) than ever.

Well, you know, we have to start thinking about what will happen
when the century ticks.  I'm determined that TOPS-20 on PANDA will
see it tick, which means fixing any bugs that have two-digit years.
The question is, how will ITS handle it?

Well a message like this is certainly guaranteed to make -my- day!  It's
always nice to have people appreciate creaky-but-reliable old ITS for still
being around after 20 years!

I thought I would take this opportunity to spread the word about something
that I don't think has been very widely publicized.  Some of you may recall
that a while ago some fellows in Sweden contacted us about running ITS on
various PDP-10's that they owned?  Well, we mailed them a set of tapes for
bringing up ITS on their 2020, which they were able to do without too much
trouble (their biggest problem was -my- fault).  That all happened over a
year ago.  Recently we learned that these guys have successfully -built-
ITS paging hardware for their KA-10, and have ITS up and running there as
well!  Totally Amazing.

No, that's the USR: device.  But they've invented the JOB: device too,

As Noel Chiappa said when talking about ITS and Multics, it's really

Several people have asked what this is about, so I suppose I should elaborate
a bit.  This stuff has been presented in papers at Usenix conferences, but
not everybody's familiar with those.

/proc is V8's replacement for the ptrace() system call and related things.
It's a slightly-odd type of file system.  Once mounted, it looks like a
single directory containing a bunch of files with numeric names.  If you
open (say) file "12345", you are looking at the address space of process
number 12345.  Writes into the file are writes into the address space.
There are ioctls for things like stopping and starting the process, sending
it signals, etc.  Access to the files is naturally subject to the standard
Unix file-permission system.  The whole thing is actually a figment of the
kernel's imagination, with the "directory" manufactured on the fly whenever
someone tries to read it, and operations on the "files" turned into the
corresponding operations on the processes.  Apart from being cleaner than
ptrace(), /proc is also faster.

[description of /n/face deleted]

In both cases, these odd filesystems look exactly like real ones, down to
things like "." and ".." entries in the directories.  You can use all the
standard Unix tools to operate on them.

At least one System V implementation of /proc exists inside AT&T, but it
hasn't made it into any released software that I know of.  I believe /n/face
is strictly a V8ism at the moment.

I am involved peripherally with this project.

There is NO attempt to shortchange or ignore ITS, WAITS, and TENEX.

But!!  We will need *papers* from people in these communities in order to
fairly cover these operating systems.

Otherwise, I will write up something really brief.  For ITS, in a few short
paragraphs I'll talk about DDT as the command decoder, PCLSR'ing, and the
environment that led to the creation of EMACS.

I think such coverage WOULD shortchange ITS.  There are lots of important
concepts that can and should be discussed in detail -- PCLSR'ing, ITS virtual
memory (not as good as TOPS-20/Tenex, but quite advanced for its time),
canonical terminals/SUPDUP/CRTSTY, symbolic system calls, CHEOPS, Knight TV
system, ...

TECO and TECO-based editors should be a paper in itself.

The following message was forwarded to me (it was originally sent to AIList
I think) with the suggestion that I should redistribute it to whatever
mailing lists of PDP-10 hackers I knew of.  I don't know anything more
about this than what is revealed here.

It does kind of sound like these guys are planning on writing a history of
PDP-10's that only mentions TOPS10 and TOPS20 and fails to consider ITS and
WAITS and perhaps shortchanges TENEX.  But I suspect that this is merely a
shortcoming of this announcement.

Subject: Announcement of the DEC 10 and PDP-6 history project (PROJECT-10262)

This message originates from 2 sources:

	Les Earnest
	Computer Science Department
	STANFORD UNIVERSITY
	Stanford, CA  94305
	415.723.9729
	ARPA: LES@SAIL.STANFORD.EDU

	Route 70
	Cherry Hill, NJ  08002
	609.665.8711
	ARPA: DEMPSTER@MARLBORO.DEC.COM (MARKET)

The goal of this project is to publish an analysis and history of
the evolution, implementation and use of Digital's 36 bit systems.
This period began with the PDP-6 in 1964 and continues today with
TOPS 10/20 development, which is scheduled to end in 1988.

We are working aggressively to finish the project, and have it
published, by March/April 1988.  This will require that the
completed manuscript be ready to go into the publication cycle
by August 1987!

The project will attempt to answer the following questions:

	1. In what markets/applications were these systems used?

	2. Who were the users of these systems and what impact did
	   roughly 2,500 TOPS 10/20 systems have on their organizations?

	3. Who were the principle system architects of these systems?
	   What features, and if there had been sufficient time to
	   implement them, would have significantly improved the
	   architecture?

	4. What impact did the decision to continue to examine design
	   extensions to the architecture have on the usefulness and
	   acceptability of these systems.  This is in contrast to a
	   more common practice today to work from a detailed design
	   specification, sometimes dated, building follow-on systems
	   which provide increased performance through the use of new
	   component technologies and packaging techniques.

	5. What part of the overall design (TOPS10/20) was technology
	   dependent and what can still be considered "unequaled" in
	   relation to other computer architectures still undergoing
	   active development?

	6. What type of development environment (both HW and SW)
	   supported and contributed to the evolution of 36 bit
	   systems?

	7. What influence did TOPS 10/20 have on other vendors system
	   development?

This history will undoubtedly be assembled from many sources and
participants.  Some information will be anecdotal; there will be
interviews with the people involved (users and developers) and technical
papers will be solicited.  Of course there will also be the packaging
and assembly of facts as we see them.

The result will hopefully have sufficient depth to serve as:

	1. An introductory or advanced text on system design and
	   hardware/system software implementation.

	2. A analysis of the success and difficulties of marketing
	   complex systems into a very crowded market of competing
	   alternatives.

	3. A catharsis for those of us who have contributed to the
	   development and use these systems and who will now move
	   onto new computing architectures and opportunities.

In addition to interviewing directly 25-50 developers, users and
product managers we will continue to work to identify contributors
and significant events up to when the final draft is submitted to
the publisher.  Two "topics" are already under development:

	1. Rob Gingell from SUN is working on a paper which looks
	   at extensions to TOPS 20 which would have enhanced its
	   capabilities.

	2. Frank da Cruz and Columbia are summarizing 10 years of
	   experience and development of TOPS 20 systems.  Some
	   effort will also be made to detail the process which
	   lead to their selection of a follow-on architecture to
	   TOPS 20.

There is a need to develop additional topics which represent the
use and application of the technology (TOPS 10/20) in other areas.
Specific recommendations are welcome as are proposals to develop
them.  A short abstract should accompany any such proposal.  Every
effort will be made to work with individuals or organizations
interested in making such a contribution.

There will be a standalone (no network connections) DECSYSTEM 2020
(YIPYIP) dedicated to supporting the project.  This system has a 3
line hunt group, with all lines accessible from a single number
(201.874.8612).

Both YIPYIP and MARKET will have "public" directories for remote
login (<log>DEMPSTER.PROJECT-10262 <Password>LCGLCG).  MARKET can
be accessed by modem (617.467.7437), however disk quota is limited.
MARKET's primary purpose <DEMPSTER.PROJECT-10262> is ARPAnet TELNET
access.  YIPYIP is a dedicated PROJECT-10262 system.  MAIL can also
be sent to DEMPSTER on either system.

YIPYIP and MARKET will keep a running summary of ideas and comments
up on Columbia's BBOARD software.  KERMIT also runs on each system
for uploads.

SAIL.STANFORD.EDU will support ARPAnet transfers to a "public" area:

	FTP<ret>
	CONNECT SAIL.STANFORD.EDU<ret>
	SEND AFN.EXT<ret>
	DSK: AFN.EXT [PUB,LES]<ret>

SAIL runs WAITS, an operating system similiar to TOPS 10.  File
names are limited to 6 characters and extensions limited to 3.


Implementation details:

	1. User input is welcomed and desired from all application
	   and geographic areas.

	2. Input from past and present developers is also desired.

	3. Throughout the project a secondary goal will be to build
	   a list of users/locations (installation date, duration and
	   disposition) of PDP-6 and KA, KI, KL and KS systems.
	   Serial numbers, if available, are requested.

	4. We anticipate that this project will generate a large
	   volume of information (which we hope will arrive
	   electronically).  Some information, for any number of
	   reasons, may not be in line with the project's stated
	   goals.  Therefore, all notes, interview material and
	   submissions will be donated to the Computer Museum in Boston
	   at the the completion of the project to be available for
	   future reference and research.

Ideas, contributions, suggestions and criticism are welcome.  As these
36 bit systems were the products of a multitude of people, so too
will be the writing of their history.

Is this an ITS mailing list (duh!)?  If so, could I be added to it?  I'm relatively
new to ITS (turist account), and I'd love to find out more.  I have great
respect for an os that was named to make fun of IBM.  Also, I saw something
somewhere about something called CAMEXEC, which called it an its-like
operating system for the pdp-11.  Since I've got an 11/34 with nothing better
to run than 2.9.1 BSD or RT11, I'm interested.  Does anyone know anything
about this? (hmm.  that sounds like a stupid question, doesn't it?)  If
I seem confused, it's because I largely am.  I'm learning about ITS by
trial and error.

I bet this will seem the strangest to you.  IS ITS public domain at this
point?  If it is, what would it take to get a distribution?  This is a very
silly question, but I seriously intend to have a 2020 of my own someday.
If Mr. Crispin can do it, so can I 8^)

On Tuesday we will talk about a number of things, including what topics
people might want to hear about in future sessions.  As a main event, I am
preparing an explanation of everyone's favorite ITS feature:

               PCLSRing:  What it is, how it's implemented,
                   and why Lisp Machines should have it.

I'll try and satisfy both the people who want to hear about low-level,
bits-between-the-toes issues, and those who want to learn universal, cosmic
principles.  I'll even relate PCLSRing to quantum mechanics.

There are now -five- machines running ITS at MIT, more than have ever
existed simultaneously before.  There is the MC KL10, and four KS10's named
AI, MX, ML, and MD.  

The MC KL10 is off maintenance contract as of the first of this month, so I
suppose its days are numbered.  At some point before the KL10 passes on to
that great machine room in the sky, the MC KL10 and the MX KS10 will swap
their names, and we will plug the new MC KS10 into the old MC's Arpanet
port.  This assures that as far as the outside world is concerned, there
will always be an ITS named MC at that Arpanet address, performing mail
service functions for MIT.  (Let's not get into the hair we will be going
through to make all the mailing lists in the world continue to work.)

The KL10 will remain available for all those who wish to continue to use
it, under the name MX.  When the KL10 retires, the name MX will be retired
with it.

Various other owners of KS10's around the world will be receiving KS10 ITS
distribution tapes in the mail soon.  The last machine we booted (MD) was
built by a volunteer using the printed instructions we plan to include with
our ITS distribution kits.

right now, but you won't find much when you get there...)  There are still
some problems with the technology for creating new ITS systems from

All kind of worms are crawling out of the woodwork because of various
programs that -know- that all ITS machines are named "AI", "MC", "ML", or

There is now a demon job that runs when ITS starts up that attempts to set

time when it discovers that the clock has been reset no longer commands the
hacker to log in and run PDSET, instead it tells him that he should just
stick around a watch what happens in case he has to run it.  The demon will
print a message on the system console explaining what it did about the
time.  If the demon was unsatisfied that it could determine the time, the
message will try to attract the hacker's attention and explain to him what
the problem was and tell him that he does have to run PDSET after all.

floor).

While I was at it I gave both devices a new feature.  They now support
deletion so you can delete items from the queue.  For example, if 7LP^F
shows you the following:

    The most recent job printed was:
     21:21 alan          7LP: BAWDEN; .FILE. (DIR)

then you can delete job 905 by doing either ^O 7LP:905 or ^O 7LP:ALAN.  In
the later case all entries owned by ALAN are deleted.  The second filename

I have installed a 7LP: device on MC and ML for using the LN01 printer on
the 7th floor to generate simple hardcopy.  Outputting to 7LP: opens a
connection to PREP (where the spooler runs) and transmits your text.  For
example :COPY DSK:ALAN;ALAN LOGIN,7LP: makes hardcopy of my init file.
Reading from 7LP:.FILE. (DIR) produces a listing of the queue on PREP, so
you can type 7LP to DDT to see who's output is in front of yours.

    Re:   AI (the KS10)
    What is the current state of thew new AI?  I have been watching
    [OZ]ARC:AI-KL, but the has been no news for a month!

Yeah, I guess I haven't said anything recently.  My last message was to
announce that I got the microcode support working?  Since then I have been
working on conditionalizing all those places that are sensitive to the
specifics of the processor.  I guess this task is somewhat easier than it
was when ITS was conditionalized for the KL, because most of the processor
dependencies are already known; a string search for "KL10P" sufficed to
find most of them.  I guess I could declare this task complete now (modulo
debugging), all that really remains is to write TTY routines for talking to
the system console through the 8080.  (They are trivial, I almost finished
them tonight.)

Next I get to learn how to interface to a bunch of random devices: the DZ11
terminals, the disk, and the tape drive.  All that stands between us and a
first try at bringing ITS up are disk routines in ITS, disk routines in the
salvager, and a trivial tape reading routine in the salvager so that we can
put a couple of things in the initial filesystem.

I guess I made a bunch of decisions along the way that ITS hackers might be
interested in, but not really much that the typical machine language
programmer will need to know about.  The protocol for one-proceed will be
different, but that remains unimplemented.  There will be a JPC, but that
hasn't been done either.  There will never be a MAR.  There is a new user
interrupt (%PINXI) that will be given to jobs in .IOTLSR mode that touch
Unibus locations with nothing in them.  The protocol for setting the time
is new, so someone need to modify PDSET or supply a new equivalent program.

Oh yeah, I also fixed a couple of problems with "Exec DDT" and the magtape
bootstrap program in the course of experimenting with the machine.  

There still remains a bunch of things to do to make the machine ultimately
useable.  Things like network code.  Code to interface to Taft's "Format
Confuser".  The Format Confuser itself.  Code for booting the machine from
the disk.  Code for frobbing the 8080 filesystem.  Etc.

I un-de-generalized the code for $$^F so that you can make all
the FN2s zero and get the default.  Ie., you can put searches
in slots besides $$0^F.  I also increased the size of the table
a little bit.

$$0^F  FIRST <foo>
$$1^F  NAME1 UP    (verbose listing)
$$2^F  SECOND <bar>
$$3^F  CDATE DOWN
$$4^F  SIZE  DOWN
$$5^F  ONLY LINKS  (had to put something here....)

You were right about cstacy's n patch being ridiculously
ungeneral.  I talked him into something nicely general and
doesn't require users to be patching DDT in order to make use
of its full functionality. Under the new scheme, you say

		namen

where name is the fn2 to give to DIR: and n is sixbit for the fn1
to give. So, for example, 

	UP434441644500	;to get a CDATE UP listing

gives you a CDATE UP listing. Also, the numeric arg is now sticky
(initially defaulting to 465162636400) so if you specify

	FOO or FOO0

you get the default. This was easy to put in since 0 didn't
designate a valid filename anyway.

Here's hoping you're satisfied...

In DDT 1440 on MC:

In a moment of randomness, I made a minor extension to DDT's $$^F
directory lister command, and tested and installed it on MC.

$$^F (or $$0^F) does the same thing it always did.
$$1^F does the same thing too, except that you can now patch in a
total of three DIR arguments (starting at DIRFN1+2 and DIRFN2+2) and
do $$2^F and $$3^F.  (In other words, $$n^F searches the two-word
entry table at DIRFN1 and uses the specified DIR names; the table is
currently 4 long, allowing you space for three numeric argument
options. An argument of zero is ignored.)

I put this in because I wanted to use the DIR device more often.
The default listings you get now are these:

foobar$$0^F DIR:NAME1 foobar
$$1^F       DIR:NAME1 UP        verbose directory listing
$$2^F       DIR:CDATE DOWN      sorted by recently created files
$$3^F       DIR:SIZE  DOWN      sorted by biggest files

Subject: TCP calls documented
To: BUG-NETWRK @ MIT-MC, INFO-ITS @ MIT-MC

I have moved most of the TCP call documentation into MC:.INFO.;ITS .CALLS.
This includes all changes to existing calls, plus the new calls
TCPOPN and NETRFC.  I have also copied various bit definitions into
SYSTEM;BITS > so that MIDAS and DDT will know about useful TCP symbols
as soon as a new ITS is assembled.

Finally, I fixed the ANALYZE code in the NETWRK package (canonical
location MC:SYSENG;NETWRK >) so that the appropriate error strings can
be generated for TCP channels.

I have installed a new .INSRTable Midas library on all ITS machines.
FORMAT is patterned after the Lisp function of the same name.  It's
documented in INFO with the rest of the insertable libraries.  Do 
:INFO LIB FORMAT to read all about it.

There is no need to tell me I'm crazy.
