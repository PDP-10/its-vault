This file has enough of Babyl to generate a library that can be autoloaded
to send mail (e.g. via C-X M) quickly (and not take up much library space).
Note that BABYL proper (the mail reader) must be generated from BABYL > and
BABYLM > -- it is NOT true that BABYL > has enough to read but not send
mail, since they both share some utility routines and those are in here.

Modification history:

 7/18/82  111   FHSU	Back to normal mailing conventions, with option to
 			rename mail file into MAIL:. new QUEUE-MAIL/XMAIL.
			passes back info. on disposition of mail. subfork
			kept unless "unhandled exception" to speed things up.
 7/15/82  105-0	ECC	Finishing touches:  dont put in Sender if user put one
			in already.  Put KDO's code in to handle IPCF
			immediate mailing, for non-net sites.  They will also
			need to load or generate-in the IMAIL library.  Add
			M-X Get Mail Template.
 7/14/82  100-4	ECC	Improve documentation for a few functions.  Improve
			templates somewhat:  they remember point, handle null
			string args better.  See also BABYL.  Added Process
			Babyl Init or Vars File, called from & Setup..  Once
			new AUX is fully in normal EMACS, can simplify.  Added
			Insert Mail Template Into VARS/Init File, setting a
			template calls it upon a visited init/vars file.
 7/12/82  99	ECC	Fix bugs in new TNX header preparation: & TNX Mail
			Buffer, & Complete TNX Header.  Change & Process
			Recipient Field to strip at-AI on OZ iff that uname
			has a directory there.  So pure-ai people show as
			such.
 7/08/82  98	ECC	Add Babyl Reply-To Field variable, Babyl Default Edit
			Mail Hook.
 7/08/82  94-7	ECC	Special hack for OZ, so mail to non-chaosnet hosts
			will have a From that can be replied to.  For mail
			from OZ, all OZ-recipients and From field have User at
			MIT-AI form.  Changed & Complete TNX Header
			and & Process Recipient Field.  The latter also will
			trim this AI-form on OZ, so OZ users wont see it.  The
			idea is to hope that Chaosnet-local (especially
			OZ-to-OZ) mail wont be replied to via AI.
 7/04/82   93	ECC	TNX robustness in writing -- open to [TECO] OUTPUT:
			& TNX Mail Buffer, & Append to TNX Mail File.u
 7/03/82   92	ECC	& Push To Edit Mail: 0 fsError so no O1B error.
 6/27/82 89-91	ECC	& Process Recipient Field fixed re reforming: was
			reforming FOO at LOCAL at OTHER to be FOO at OTHER,
			clearly wrong.  See comment in code re issues.  People
			may want it more featureful re recognition of local
			host, but I dont see how just now.  Better safe.
 6/14/82   88	ECC	Fix & ITS Mail Buffer to use last @ on line, e.g. so
			@FILE specs will work.  Maybe FOO@BAR@GAGGLE too?
 4/29/82   84	KRONJ	Dont need to include site name in Babyl User Name.
 3/07/82   83	KRONJ	Add Bcc: header field for TNX
 3/01/82   82	KRONJ	Fixed From: field handling in & Complete TNX Header.
			Babyl User Name with different capitalization from
			fsXUName wasn't being used, and Sender: wasn't being
			inserted if From: was already in buffer.
 2/28/82   81	KDO	Added code in & TNX Mail Buffer to set generation-
			count of unsent-mail file to 0 so that next mailing
			doesn't overwrite it.  Changed erset to a catch in Edit
			and Mail Buffer so that ? gives backtrace after error.
 1/16/82   80	ECC	Adding Babyl FCC To variable for TNX.
11/10/81   79	ECC	Removed & Expand Mailing Lists, since MMcM claims that
			XMAILR now performs mailing list expansion.
11/02/81   78	ECC	Fixed & Expand Mailing Lists infinite loop bug.  Was
			looping for non-mailing-list entries.
 6/11/81   76	EAK	Removed DM hack because PDL claims COMSYS will handle
			COMSAT input files now.  Deleted the following line:
			fsMachine-(f6DM)"e etAI:'
 4/20/81   74   Moon	Mailing lists for Tenex (see & Expand Mailing Lists)
 3/25/81   73	ECC	F, V, R, and & Setup Reply Template moved into BABYL
			proper since are either only for mail-reading (F and
			R) or is a dispatch (V) command.  Make BABYLM smaller.
 2/16/81   72	ECC	F and R only use 1 line of subject, since ITS mailer
			cannot handle (I think).
12/20/80   69	ECC	Changed yanker in accordance with Babyl changes to set
			bounds just around message.
11/07/80   64	ECC	Work on F: fixed so done hook goes off in *Babyl*, not
			*Mail*.  Added variable and argument options to
			control reading To/Subject, whether into .
			Mail edit level binds C-M-\ to filler.
11/07/80   61	EAK,ECC	Made F use @:F to optimize redisplay by
			scrolling the message down to where the yanked
			message will be, and back up when done.
 ??? -- what JP work in here? -- ???
 9/17/80   52	ECC	Changed Edit and Mail Buffer to print only header and
			current line if printing terminal.  Used to print
			whole buffer, bad for C, 3R, 4R, F.
 8/27/80   50	ECC	Added pruning of BBOARD@ to INFO- and * pruning.  Also
			made Babyl Dont Reply To search bounded over <CRLF>
			<mailbox> <CRLF> so username can be fully delimited.
 8/24/80   48	ECC	Added 2-window control to M, C, F, and V (new template
			command).  Renamed # Babyl ^F to # Babyl F.  Should do
			the opposite in BABYL for the finder function.
 8/24/80   45	ECC	Split up the R/M/C/F shared code in # Babyl R and
			distributed it among R, M, C, and F for clarity and
			better modularity.  New routine & Push to Edit Mail
			which they call.  Renamed # Edit Mail to Edit and Mail
			Buffer, since it can conceivably now be user callable
			on any buffer, and since it now sends the mail.  #
			Babyl ^F keeps same subject or makes one, and calls
			the parser.  Deleted the obsolete idea-file RMCF >.
 8/24/80   40	ECC	Added mail template hacking to # Babyl R and added
			Mail With Template (# Babyl V) and Set Mail Template.
			Changed some variable names and declared all of them
			so user can use Edit Options etc.  Names changed to
			include "Babyl" in their names to allow giving "Babyl"
			as filter to Edit Options.  Changes (<...> is added):
			<Babyl> Dont Reply To
			<Babyl> CC To
			<Babyl> Require Subjects
			Babyl Reply Hook -> Babyl Edit Mail Hook
			<Babyl> Day of Week Flag
			<Babyl> User Name
			<Babyl> Personal Name

 8/23/80   38	ECC	& Process Recipient Field modified, primarily to leave
			recipient buffer with pairs of lines, not only mailbox
			names, but full recipients as well for more general
			use as a parser.  # Babyl R uses it to remove
			duplicate and unwanted recipients.  Semantics of Dont
			Reply To changed a little, and INFO-xxx and *xxx
			always removed.  Added option Babyl Trim Recipient List
			to control whether any of this is done.
 7/17/80   20	ECC	& TNX Mail Buffer ensures that there is a final CRLF.
			Was necessary for XMAILR, though XMAILR claims now to
			be fixed so it could possibly be removed.  Changed
			recipient pruning to (1) use just the mailbox part of
			TO (not host, not rfc733 personal name), and (2)
			delete the entire recipient, not just a stupid FKD.
			Also it will remove a lone Cc: line with no recipients.

!Process Babyl Init or Vars File:! !C Find init or vars file and process it.
Babyl init and vars files are similar to EMACS ones, though these
    should only be for customizing Babyl.  If you only use Babyl from
    WITHIN EMACS, you can customize it with your EMACS init or vars
    file.  You would then need no Babyl init or vars file.  But if you
    want to use Babyl outside EMACS, i.e. :BABYL on ITS or BABYL.EXE
    on TNX, then you should put Babyl customizing in a Babyl init or
    vars file.
Babyl checks your home directory for a Babyl init file, which should
    be Teco code: BABYL INIT (ITS) or BABYL.INIT (TNX).
If no init file is found, it looks for a vars file:  BABYL VARS (ITS)
    or BABYL.VARS (TNX).  This file should be in the same format as an
    EMACS vars file.
This processing is only done the first time Babyl is loaded, for
    reading or sending mail.  If you edit your Babyl init or vars file
    after this first entry to Babyl, you can give the M-X Process
    Babyl Init or Vars File command manually so that Babyl takes
    notice of the changes.

!Mail With Template:! !C Edit and send mail, with template initialization.
Describe Edit and Mail Buffer for details about message editing and
    the general hooks available.
The message is initialized from a template, which may specify any
    header or text components.  The template is a variable, containing
    a copy of what the mail editing buffer should be initialized to.
    It can optionally start with a value for point, within brackets,
    e.g. it might start:  [35]To:
String argument is a template name.  The template variable name is
    formed from this name -- e.g. for a template named "Foo", the
    variable is named Babyl Template Foo.  If you are using the Babyl
    V command the template name is read with completion.
If you give a numeric argument of 2, we will try to use 2 windows,
    current message in top one, message being sent in bottom one.
See the M-X Set Mail Template command for aid in creating templates.
Runs the Teco program in the variable Babyl M Hook if one.  This
    program can check the variable Current Babyl Template Name, 0 for
    normal mailing, if it wants to further process the template.!

!Edit and Mail Buffer:! !S Edit some mail to send in recursive edit level.
All the Babyl mail-sending commands (C, F, M, R, V) invoke this one.
To send the mail, exit the recursive edit level with ^R Exit.
To abort, use Abort Recursive Edit.  If you abort, you can
    continue editing the message later with the C command from Babyl
    or by giving Send Mail an argument.
The ^R Babyl Yank command will insert a copy of the current Babyl
    message if there is one.  (E.g. the one being replied to.)
Paragraph Delimiter is temporarily set so lines starting with "-"
    won't be considered part of a paragraph.  Thus the --Text...  line
    won't get in the way of a ^R Fill Paragraph.
If the variable Babyl Require Subjects is non-0, you will be asked to
    supply a subject line if you forgot to include it while editing.
The variable Babyl Edit Mail Hook may be set to a Teco program to run
    just before entering the recursive edit level.  If this variable
    is 0, we will connect C-M-Y to ^R Babyl Yank, C-M-\ to ^R Fill
    Indented Mail Region, and set the Paragraph Delimiter variable.
    This default action may be called by your hook, by:
	mBabyl Default Edit Mail Hook!

 !* Note:  This function cannot be named & Edit Mail, since the "&" will cause!
 !* HELP-R not to consider it for describing.  It used to be called # Edit!
 !* Mail for that reason before it became a user-callable (if ever desired)!
 !* command.!

 !* Note that each line in Babyl Default Edit Mail Hook should begin with!
 !* exactly two Tabs, and the whole should start with a CRLF.  And dont put!
 !* any comments in there -- for then the comment compressor would remove the!
 !* Tabs.  All this is so the INFO listing (auto-produced) will look nice: !

!& Process Recipient Field:! !S Merge, reform and parse.
NUMARG is recipient buffer, pre-comma NUMARG is default host name.
STRARG is field name, without any colon.
Bounds should be set to just the header.
Point is left at the start of the field body.
Recipient buffer has the parse, a pair of lines per recipient:  1st
    line is mailbox name, 2nd line is full (cleaned up) recipient
    specification.  Host names are upper-case since TWENEX mailer
    requires it.!

!*  All instances of the field are merged into one, with continuation
    lines.  Some cleaning is done (of whitespace, @s), host name is
    added if necessary, and field is auto-filled.
If variable Babyl Strip Local Host is non-zero, then the local host
    name is removed.  (On ITS, all ITS hosts are local.)!
