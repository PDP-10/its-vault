Subject: cooking and camping

Bread:	Try commercially available Scandinavian knackbrod or Wasa crip 
bread--contains no water, won't go stale.
	Try some of the recipies in Sir Kenelm Digby's Closet Opened(1651) or 
traditional welsh or irish recipies containing lots of fruit (like 30 to 50 %)
	In general, bread with no eggs, milk, or butter will go stale faster, 
but enriched breads will mold sooner--take your pick.
	What the scots did was carry along whole oats and small flour mills 
and make fresh oatcakes on griddles.  The whole grain didn't spoil and they 
needed no ovens.  Ive had fresh oat cakes but havn't managed the knack of 
making them.  They are available commercially, although they don't taste quite 
the same.

Noodles: You Bet!!
	Vermicelli is 15th c if not earlier cooked in either good broth and 
served with cheese or in water and served with sugar and spices
	Tortelini are also period under the name of Tarteletts.  (actually the 
fillings would have been different, different spices, probably currents added) 
You can buy them dry in boxes.

Meats:	In Cariodoc & Elizabeth's Medieval Miscellany you will find something 
called (i believe) "gentry salt"  It's a mixture of spices and breadcrumbs to 
be used along with vinegar (at least 5% acidity) to preserve cooked fowl. 
(duck is nice)  It's good as a side dish or condement, but i wouldn't want it 
as a meal unless is were washed and cooked into something.

Cheeze and eggs:	We had good succes making these last even at room 
temperature by dipping them in wax.  try wrapping a meal's worth of chese in a 
bit of *cotton* (not that gastly synthetic stuff they foist on one under the 
same name) chese cloth and covering it with melted parafin.  it discourages 
mold and keeps the water from the cooler out.

One other technique:	Try making a lot of something that is period and tasty 
and that you know will keep.  Then go up to a group that is camping and eating 
together and say, "I have more x than i can use, can i trade it for some of 
your y?" and if the cooks have (as they often do) grossly overestimated the 
ammount of food they needed you are likely to get a meal and some good 
conversation to go with it.

Subject: Fighting Blow Strength

This is a topic that always troubles me when it comes up, because what we
are trying to do is legislate morality, and that never works well.  The
reason that there are problems with calibration levels in the lists is
because, with present technology, there is no objective way to judge the
strength of a blow "from the outside", and that judgement must therefore
be left to the individual being struck.  The judgment is necessarily
subjective, and the perception of the blow is influenced by many things.

One problem is that different fighters fight for different reasons,
and with many different attitudes.  Someone who is out for the sport and is
a fan of good technique will "die" much more willingly than someone who
is consumed by winning.  There is the belief that different tourneys require
different calibration levels, so that a blow that might have "killed" in a
Baronial Champion tourney won't cut the mustard in Crown.  Many members of
the Chivalry feel silly being "killed" by unbelted fighters, and allow this
to color their judgement.  The list is endless.

This variety is the chief problem i have with the "too heavy, my lord" call.
Here we have proven ourselves completely unable to judge one threshhold of
blow satisfactorily; how much worse will it be if there are two?  As things
stand the Marshals can intervene and enforce an "obvious" kill.  With a
fighter able to ignore blows that are too heavy, even this infrequently-used
tool would be taken away.  It also allows fighters to define the range of
blows themselves; the same people who abuse the system now will continue to
do so.  My mind boggles at the spectacle of a three-hour final bout at Crown,
with each blow struck alternately too heavy and too light as the finalists
search delicately for that "just right" blow that will fell the opponent.

Also, anything that requires fighters to think more is probably moot anyway.
:-)

I think the Lady Malice is on the right track with her observation on the
concept of a "killing" blow.  Combat in the SCA is an organized spectator
sport.  We don't really die, we're in it for the fun.  I personally take
lighter blows than many, frequently just because the blow was pretty and
"ought" to have worked.  (Also i don't like getting mashed to a pulp.  :-)
We are not trying to hurt each other, we are demonstrating physical prowess
in a particular area.

I am not in favor of going to a judged system such as is used in saber,
though.  There should be some "reasonable" minimum blow strength, or the
fighting will quickly degenerate into something very much like fencing. :-)
The weapons that we are modeling have mass and behave in certain ways
because they do, and we must not lose that.

The above is mostly addressed to the fighters among you; how about the rest?
Non-fighters should take an interest in fighting so that the fighters have
some other points of reference for behavior.  If nothing else each local
group should be very careful in choosing its Knight Marshal, for it is very
likely that the trainees will turn out very much like the trainer.  If your
KM is turing out robot-like stick jocks *and you don't like that*, complain
to your Seneschal.  (Seneschals *love* input.  Just ask them.  :-)  Of course
for this to make a difference there will have to be a willing right-thinking
individual in the wings to propose as an alternative, but at least the powers
that might as well be will be aware that there *is* a problem.

Enough for now.

Subject: Sergeants and Yeomans Tourney

Greetings Lady Orianna. I'd just like to comment on the differences between
your Sergeant's and Yeoman's Tourney and ours.

Here in An Tir most (all?) of the baronesses sponsor a yearly Tourney to
allow those interested to earn a Sergeant's or Yeoman's belt. This is
not a "top score gets the belt" competition, but more of a personal
challange to score well overall. Several or no belts may be given out.
(Last year 5 Sergeants and 1 Yeoman were make in Lions Gate.)

The areas of testing are very similar - fighting/archery, strategy &
tactics, heraldry, games, dance, bardic skill, and chivalry. Each applicant
is required to submit a letter of application, done by his/her own hand.
(I say "done" rather than "calligraphed" because last year Baroness Amanda
received an application tooled in leather; and the year before one that was
carved in wood.)

Chivalry is judged by all of the ladies present at the event and covers the
applicant's behaviour over the previous year.

One very important item that you didn't mention was the responsibilities
of the S and Y toward their Baroness. A new S or Y swears fealty to his
Baroness and promises to protect and defend her and the Barony against all
comers. There are "Sergeants Against the World" battles at kingdom events,
a "Baronesses Chess Tournament" where the S&Y give their advice and when a
Sergeant makes Knight, he must first ask his Baroness to release him. 
Somewhat serious stuff, but a S/Y is very proud to wear his belt (with
the identifying baronial buckle).

The Ice Dragon arts and sciences competition (held annually in the Hael) has
over forty categories and requires an incredible number of judges.  Naturally,
an attempt is made to get judges who know what they are doing.   It would seem
that the result would be that the people capable of doing the best work are
judging and the competitors are drawn primarily from the second tier.

Subject:      Woozy at the War

In reply to the gentle who inquired about ways to avoid suffering from
the heat while camping....

My lord who used to heavy list and now fences suffers greatly from heat
as well as sunburning more quickly than most people I have ever known.
The best solution we have for him is whenever he feels particularly hard
hit I empty the water from the ice bags in the cooler (maybe not period,
but definitely a sane thing to have) and splash it behind his ears, wrists
neck and then empty whatever is left over his head.  It works, but I always
thought it a bit odd until the Boredom War when I was running around as
list mistress and he caught me (who is usually fairly impervious to heat)
getting that heat glazed look.  Before I could protest, he doused me with a
healthy splash of the water.  It was such a temperature shock it almost hurt,
but it also snapped me out of it and made my body feel much cooler.

I don't suggest it for everyone, but if you can stand it (and don't mind
getting your garb wet) a preventative dose of that a couple of times during
the day might cool you down enough to take some of the strain off your body
so you can enjoy that nighttime revelling.

Subject: squeezing octopi (octopuses?)

> "Mommy? Why is that man wearing a dress and squeezing an octopus?"

I darn near fell off my chair laughing at this.  There is a definite
need in both mundane and SCA life not to take oneself too seriously.
This good gentle (he is a good gentle, I've met him) stated that 
he grew up in a traditional Scots household.  He appreciates the pipes.
I think he has a right to poke a bit of fun at his own culture.  from
the point of view of a very small mundane child, seeing a Scotsman
for the first time in full array with pipes is a highly unusual thing
(small Child, not just small boy). I will take occasional humorous pot
shots at my own activities, or activities of groups I am involved with,
not ever meaning to insult.  Saying 'I'm dressing up in a tin can and 
beating people over the head with sticks' is not an insult to fighters,
but an indication that I'm not getting solemn and stodgy about an
activity I joined because it was fun.  There must be tremendous personal
satisfaction (which can be loosely translated as fun) in mastering such
a difficult instrument as the bagpipes, or people wouldn't spend so
many years perfecting their skill with them.  I understand that many
people, maybe even many SCA people, do not like ANY bagpipes, and they
do make rude comments about what they don't understand.  I find it a 
true joy to be able to dance to the music of a gifted piper, but I'm 
certainly not going to be somber and solemn about it;  Traditional 
reels and step-dances are some of the most light-hearted and cheerful
music of any historical period, and I find the Scots culture to be 
much more fun-loving than the Normans, for example.  This is probably 
why so many SCA folk take Scottish and Irish personas.  
   OK, maybe Aaron should have included a smiley, but he meant no hurt.
I am saying this because I too poke fun at myself and the SCA, and 
could have posted the same thing.  We can retain our respect for the 
talents and effort we put forth, but if we start taking ourselves too
seriously, this wonderful little universe we call the current middle ages
won't be any fun anymore.

Oh, wow!  Athol Brose!  Alcoholic oatmeal, my favourite!

For those who have no idea what we're talking about, here's my own (quite
successful, I might add) recipe:
2 c rolled oats (these should not be quick-cooking; I've never tried it 
with McCann's Irish, which are steel-cut oats, but it might be worth an 
experiment...)
2 c cold water
1 pt. heavy cream
1 pt. good Scots Whisky (don't waste a single malt on this unless you want
to be really extravagant, in which case I recommend Glenfiddich -- the Islay
malts, like Laphroaig (my favourite), are really too strong for this.  Drink
them straight and unadulterated, as the good Lord (and I'm not telling which
one <grin>) intended).

Put the water to the oatmeal.  Let the mess sit overnight.  In the 
morning, strain out the oat water and wring the remaining mash through a
cheescloth (I like to let some of the "pulp" get into the water).  The
oat water should be almost silky in texture.  Then add the cream and
whisky, and honey to taste (start with about 1/4c).  Shake it all up,
and let it sit in the fridge for another day or so, for all the
flavours to marry.  It's a good idea to keep it out of the sun at
tourneys, but I've found it doesn't really need chilling (in fact, it
tastes better at just cooler than room temp, or even room temp) --
probably all that lovely high-test Scotch... <grin>

Enjoy, and as the Scots say, "Slainte mhaith" (pron. slan-che vah).

After 24 hours in the cooler it's nearly thawed, i add more broth and heat it

Bayleaf repels ants and most crawly bugs, and is definitely in period.  
Other repellants (but ones that might flavor food!) would be cedar shavings or 
pennyroyal oil or herb.  To keep bread in a closed box (i.e. not a basket, 
which has air circulation), be sure to put some variety of clean rushes or 
porous paper in the bottom, separated by a trivet from the bread.  The rushes 
or paper will absorb excess moisture (keeping the bread from getting soggy as 
the heat drives out some of its moisture), and the trivet will keep the rushes 
from sticking to the bread.  Another alternative to this is heavy waxed paper, 
which is not quite the equivalent of the oil-paper that I think goes back this 
far, but is probably more aesthetic than plastic.  Oil cloth (oiled canvas, 
with an oil that is edible but not easily gone rancid) will also do for many 
things.  These will make your food a little soggy if it has any moisture to 
it.

If you are hanging things from trees et al, dip a portion of the rope in 
pennyroyal oil to keep bugs from crawling down the rope onto your food.

Food in coolers can also be put in oilcloth or up on some sort of trivet 
arrangement.  Ice can be frozen in crockery, also.  Coolers may not be period, 
but on the other hand, food poisoning is...

If you want to have bread keep, here are some options:
	Make flatbread (no yeast)  (this is like putting it out in the
		sun to begin with...:-)
	Don't use milk or eggs, but use more oil than usual
	Look into receipts for hard crusted breads, like pumpernickel, and
		make round loaves only big enough for one meal (no exposed
		cut sides).  Bake the bread on a porous surface (unglazed
		ceramic, such as you can get for pizza, or a board--not 
		PINE!) to get a good bottom crust.  If you have neither,
		then halfway through baking (when the bread is fairly well
		"set,") put the bread up on a baking rack.  Hope you have good
		teeth!

Try the book "Putting Things By" (forget the author's name--apologies).  This 
will tell you how to do nifty things like waterglass eggs (don't know if this 
is period...).

I'd recommend hitting your local backpacking store or outing club and look 
into "trail cooking."  The ingredients tend to be simple staples that keep 
well (and most things are period or late period--potatoes, tomatoes and corn 
are rampant...).  Cured meats are often well prepared in stews with dried 
fruit.  Most things will not ship once cooked, since it is their lack of 
moisture or concentration of sugar or salt which keeps them preserved.

Also remember that water is easy to boil, which means that you have a variety 
of noodles and noodle sauces (many of which can be kept well in jars or 
reconstituted or made simply and fresh).  Eat your bread early on, and then 
move on to your stores of pasta and grains.

Let's face it.  Trail cooking gets monotonous fast, but fasting is even more 
monotonous.  Trail cooking IN PERIOD is worse.

Make sure they are glazed inside.  Unglazed pottery with caked food is a

One more thing --

I commented in the first missive that those gentles who were in Danulf's
mailing list need not mail to me, since I'll be getting his database. This
is not quite complete.

When Danulf sent out the formal request for information, he asked people
something to the effect of "Do you want your net address to be publically
available?". If you did not reply to this, or you replied in the negative,
you will *not* be listed in the Domesday; Danulf is quite firm about this.
Thus, if you didn't reply to this question (or signed up for the mailing
list before Danulf had put down the formal rules for joining), and you
want to be in the book, write to me and tell me so.

Granted, there are not a lot of active equestrians (most of us spend
our money living and tourney-ing, not buying horses!), but there is
a resurgence of interest in equestrianism in the West, and the SCA in
general. I know that there is a lot of equestrian activity in Caid.

I remember that there was a fair bit of activity when I first got
into the SCA (A.S. 10 or 11, I disremember), with target tilting
at the Big Trees (now Bort Meadows) site.

In regards to the recent messages about trying to maintain food
and cooking at Pennsic, and trying to keep food from spoiling
despite the heat, in the past few years there has been
"restaurants" at the war. Some of them have meal plans, so that
you can pay a fee and get meals for the duration of the war. The
food ranges from tolerable to quite good, and the vendors have a
good history of maintaining appropriate standards.

Subject: Re: Camping Considerations


A few suggestions to help your camping efforts.  First, it sounds like
your eating area is not covered by any kind of tarp or pavillion.
This is a sound investment because, only one person in your camping
group need make it, and it will keep the sun off of you during the
day, giving you a shady place to eat, relax, and store food.

Second, buy yourself a parasol.  It will keep the sun off of you while
you are watching battles and shopping.  (It also can be used to keep
the sun off of that special lady, but only if she stands real close).
Also, drink half-strength Gatorade.  The rule (as they teach to
waterbearers) is, if you can't taste the electrolites, you better have
some more.  I also might suggest a midday bath or shower (as was done
in civilized country, but not by the Frankish barbarians).  And make
sure your clothes are loose fitting and breath well.

Third, you may want to use an cooler, even though it is not period.
Remember, you do not have the option of slaughtering animals on
premisis.  Disguising it may be nice, but each campsite has its own
level of authenticity, and ultimately it is your own standards you
must meet.  I also use a gas stove to cook, because with 5000 people
packed into Cooper's lake, not everyone can build a firepit.  In
period people would have used charcoal for cooking rather than open
fires for the most part anyway.  A small charcoal grill can be bought
inexpensively.  Last of all, although there is a large psycological
barrier to leaving the War to go into town, Butler is only 10 miles
away, and has grocery store, department stores, and all kinds of other
modern conveniences.  If your staying the week, you can always plan to
make one trip out to restock perishable commodities.

Best of luck putting your camp together, and I hope to see you,
Inshallah, at the War.

Greetings!

"An Exaltation of Lark, or The Venereal Game", by James Lipton, 2nd
edition, was published by Penguin Books, 1977, and reprinted in 1987.
ISBN 0 14 00.4536 8, for those of you fascinated by such things.  Any
decent bookstore should be able to order it in.

Just a brief sampling of the more delightful period terms lsited
therein:

A Superfluity of Nuns
A Draught of Bottlers
A Neverthriving of Jugglers
A Melody of Harpists
An Example of Masters (!)
A Scolding of Seamtresses
A Disworship of Scots
A Dignitity of Canons
A Charge of Curates
A Discretion of Priests
A Skulk of Friars
An Abominable Sight of Monks


A period term for Knights is A Route of Knights, from the Old French
Route, meaning a troop or throng.  However, I prefer a Chain of
Knights, or A Bashing of Knights. 

For Laurels, depending on one's point of view:  A Wreath of Laurels, A
Branch of Laurels, A Pomposity of Laurels, A Stitch of Laurels, A
Snitch of Laurels, A Snip of Laurels, A Snipe of Laurels, etc.

For Pelicans: A Weight of Pelicans (or even A Hundredweight of
Pelicans), A Flock of Pelicans, A Service of Pelicans, or (for those
of you with peerophobia) A Disservice of Pelicans.

Any SCAdian order has at one time of another been, for example, A
Disorder of Silver Crescents.

A Staff of Marshalls
A Gawk of Mundanes
A Bored of Directors
A Flurry of Ladies-in-Waiting

Although not active in the SCA for some time I feel compelled to respond to
this posting.  The piper, be he novice or professional, made a poor choice
of time and place for early morning playing.  I suspect that if he was a 
novice the idea was to play reveille not practice.  Being awakened by the 
pipes can be quit nice if done properly (some posters to this group have
already indicated this).  Please note that unlike some instruments, the 
pipes require an expert player to pull that off since you are fighting *4* 
reeds all of which MUST be in tune.  Very few non-military pipers can tune
their pipes 8 hours before they play and have them close enough to make it work.

If he was a good piper, he should have checked around the evening before and
found out what the response would be.  He needed to be convinced that the 
rest of the group would NOT be upset.  

One way or the other he goofed.

This comment, from a group of people who dress up in period clothing is 
just plain unthinking. What does that little boy say about the man wearing
tights?  

I do not want this to be a flame.  I hope only to get you to think before 
you make comments that may offend or hurt some one.  I take great pride in 
my small Scottish heritage and with my temper it takes all my will not to 
become angry when someone makes a comment about the kilt.  I simply recall 
that many cultures wore something similiar if you go far enough back in time.  

As to the "Octopus" crack, this and all the cracks about squeezing cats are 
very upsetting to me if you consider the extraordinary amount of time it 
takes to be even a moderately proficient piper.  For my almost 20 years of
playing I have been amazed at the misconceptions about the pipes that people
have and the number of really stupid things they say about them.  Things they
would never say about another musician or musical instrument.  

I will now climb down off my soap box with these final pleas.  Be upset with 
the piper for making a mistake but remember he is only a single person.  
Remember what others may be saying about how you look at your next public 
appearance.  Consider that poking fun at something you do not like or under-
stand is really rather childish and may cause bad feelings where simple silence
rarely hurts anyone.

Again, this is not a flame.   Just a plea that you think before your type.

Sorry,

Rich England

Subject: Various styles of "set and turn single"

-- In reply to Dani's questions about "Set and Turn Single" --

	SET PEDANT


In Carolingia, the standard was that each dancer would step left and then
right (pretty much a single step, quite flat), and turn CCW in a small circle.
That's the local SCAdian style, courtesy of Baron Patri and Dr. Brainard's
reconstructions;  I think that you can find other groups in New England
following the style of Cecil Sharp and the Country Dance Society.

The Country Dance Society dancers go right, then left, then turn CW in
a small circle, and (it's been a while) I think that most of them do the
syncopated 3-steps-in-two-beats style.  In most instances, this is done
either along or across the set;  however, there are some English Country
dances (I think that Lilliburlero [1686] is one, but don't have my Playford
handy to check), and Scottish Country dances as well, that have a "progressive
set", which you have seen, in which the dancers make their sets at a 45-degree
angle to the direction in which they are proceeding (towards the other dancer,
who in some dances is their partner, and in some dances may be their corner).

I'm hardly an expert on the Scottish Country Dance, as I normally try it
only once a year, at the New England Folk Festival;  what I recall of it
is that it too is syncopated, as a small-single+change-weight+small-kick-to-
pointe (easier, and more pleasant, to do than to describe).

If you go to New England contradances (which are a lot of fun for newcomers,
and become more fun with practice), you will find people doing the step-and-
kick style, in what's called a "balance";  the standard is to step towards
your partner, then away, because the following figure usually brings you
towards your partner (the commonest figure to follow a balance is a swing.
If you have never done this, you are indeed missing something wonderful, and
in the public interest I will volunteer to teach it [outside of SCA happenings]
to interested people, particularly ladies (-:  End of public service
announcement.)

The method Dani describes, in which both dancers move in the same direction,
on opposite feet, sounds to me to be somewhat less flirtatious than if they
move away, then towards, then turn away from their partner.  My (not-overly-
educated) opinion of the hand-holding is that holding hands for the set
itself might work, but holding hands for the turn single would give the
dance a significantly different (and more inappropriately modern) flavor.
I'd assume that most (if not all) of the dancers would have similar feelings,
though, and wouldn't do that.

Also, I would recommend trying "Rufty Tufty" first using a turn-in-place,
and then a turn-in-a-small-circle;  for that dance (if I haven't confused
it with "Heartsease") I think that you'll find one clearly superior to the
other.

As for the old question "which way does it start?", I've no good answer.
I vaguely remember hearing something (which I think may have been attributed
to Baron Patri, to the effect that there was a switching of starting
directions (and feet) during the eighteenth century, from the left to the
right.  I've also heard the assertion that people in the Middle Ages (and
maybe the Renaissance as well) would go to the right, or clockwise, as they
would consider the other direction to be unlucky.  (Something about going
against the sun's direction was supposed to be unlucky.)  Finally, there is
an interesting difference between the SCAdian and CSharp reconstructions of
siding:  the SCAdian (locally) is to make a small double left ("side LEFT"),
to meet brushing right shoulders, and a double back on the right foot;  the
CDS style ("J-siding") is to make a double and turn half to face back, and
a double and turn back to place -- but as they brush RIGHT shoulders, they
call it "siding RIGHT"!  In the absence here (in my office) of reference works
and time to research, I wonder if there might be some lack of consistency
across primary sources, as to whether a direction refers to the feet or hands,
or to one for some figures and the other for others.

I should add that the differences in style between the local SCAdians and
the CDS has caused me embarrassment on more than one occasion, while I was
trying to get used to such differences.  At an English dance at the NEFF,
it was politely pointed out to me that I had all the moves down, but as
mirror images!  It might be well to keep this in mind, in groups which have
people who have experience with non-SCA English Country Dance.

Good pipers sleep in :-).  Not only that, but good pipers will be the first
in line to maul the guy tuning up when they're trying to sleep.

The person who can tune their pipes eight hours before they play them can
play them while walking on water.  There's just no way you can pull that off,
particularly when your pipes have been sitting in a non-climate-controlled
tent all night.  The only way this would be possible would be for the pipes
to sit in a box that has absolutely no variation of temperature and humidity,
and even then it'd be a deed on the order of magnitude of parting the Red
Sea or finding decent food in England.

Subject: Camping considerations
Message-Id: <8806211032.AA00994@davids.UUCP>

Having just returned from a camping event (Border Raids) I have
a couple of questions which have occurred to me that I'd like
to have opinions on.

These are questions which "ought" to be covered in the varied
introductory texts (i.e. Knowne World Handbook and that ilk),
but which I have not been able to find covered in such texts.

First is storage and types of food.  We had a couple of problems
with our food over the weekend.  The worst was the ants that found
their way into the loaf of bread which was wrapped in plastic,
and the other loaf of bread that dried out completely because it'd
been left in the sun.  

While leaving bread in the sun is a silly thing to do there ought
to be something better to do.  Like storing it in some sort of
box, one which it wouldn't matter if it were left in the sun or 
not and one which is proof from the various and sundry beasties
lurking about.  A wicker basket type thing would serve for keeping
the sun off but not for keeping beasties out.  (A related problem
was the ants which found the outsides of the honey jars, something
which would draw ants into a wicker basket even if a loaf of bread
would not).  Can wooden boxes be made to be safe from beasties?

One desire of mine is to keep the solution at least somewhat period
if not totally period.  Encasing everything in silvery plastic
is not the proper solution :-), even though it is a very good solution
for many purposes.  Something else which bothers me (but I still use)
is the predominance of coolers.  Not only are coolers definitely
out of period, but food stored in them has a very great chance
of being soaked.

Is there an herb which is repellant to beasties but is safe to eat?
That would be a nice solution if there were...  The herb book I
have -- while it is an otherwise wonderful-seaming book -- does
not cover herbs for non-perfume/cooking/health uses.

I got rather tired of the summer-sausage/whole-wheat-roll diet over
the weekend.  Fortunately I did have some fruit, and we did have
a feast saturday night, but the rolls just didn't cut it very well.

I am thinking ahead to the war.  We'll be attending for the whole
week this year and I'm rather worried along these lines.  I can
cook on a campfire -- I'm not *that* addicted to my roomates
microwave :-) -- but prefer not to.  Something which would be nice 
is breads/fruits/meat-dishes which can be cooked up in advance and 
transported into the place.

All of these are period concerns as well as modern concerns, so
surely there are solutions.  I would be interested in hearing others'
solutions.

Second is what to do about heat problems.  This last weekend was
very hot and very dry.  I thought I did all the proper things to
make sure I didn't have any heat problems, but ended up with
an horrocious headache and feeling "woozy" during our feast and
ended up not doing *any* of the revelling which I really wanted
to take part in :-).  (Not to mention the lady I'd been talking
to all day .... sigh ... ).

I was drinking water all day long (enough that I was passing water
normally).  I ate one or two ounces of beef jerky (high in salt).  
As I said above, I had whole-wheat rolls, peaches, sausage, cheese 
for breakfast & lunch.  The only bad thing I did was to have share 
some cheap Italian wine with the lady I mentioned.  (About 2 "drinks" 
worth).  This was around dinner time just before court.  I had had 
weak head pains all day long, but they did not start in earnest 
until evening/court.  I think I may have stopped drinking water after I had 
that wine, but I'm not sure.  Also, I wore a headpiece all day long
made from a circlet holding down a a piece of light yellow linen.
The circlet itself does not press against my skull, but that day I
wore the linen a little differently -- two layers between the circlet
and my skull instead of one.  It eventually was uncomfortable and
I switched back to one layer.  The last thing is that I'm not a fighter,
but I did spend a fair bit of time in the sun watching fights and
visiting the merchants.  This includes a late afternoon stroll through
the merchant area and the two bridge battles.  (3-5 PM).

Am I doing reasonable things?  Can someone recommend a book/article to
read regarding heat?  Again this is something which isn't covered well
in the KWH (and the like).  The relavent article in the KWH covers
the next stage or two beyond where I was.

I would really *love* to be able to enjoy a court for once.  It seems
that for some reason by the time court comes around I am always out
of it in some way or another.  Either these heat problems, or like
at Harvest Day last fall when court wasn't held until very very late
and I was very much out of it and still had to drive back to Lexington
that night.

Oh.  And if you get the impression that I had a bad weekend -- well
I didn't.  It was a good event ('twould have been better if there'd
been some place to park the cars OTHER THAN ***IN*** THE CAMPSITES)
and we had a lot of fun.  There were two memorable things.  The first
was the investment of the Baron Flame.  The Flame has existed for
some really long time (as a Barony) but has never had a Baron.  Now
it does.  The *really* memorable part was the chant which was sung
while the people of the Barony (as well as the people of Dragonsmark,
my shire) processed down to the "stage" (what's the right term?).
If I can manage it I'll get a copy of the chant and type it
into here ...

The other memorable thing was seeing the reactions people had when
offered mead for breakfast on sunday morning.  (See, there was this
feast and we -- Phillip the Pilgrim and myself -- made 5 gallons
of St Faustus' quick mead for the feast.  But for some reason, even
though everybody agreed it was good mead and that the food was
good, the people didn't feel up to eating lots of food and drinking
lots of mead.  Funny how that happens ...).  Anyway, mead for breakfast
caused either an "eeeuuu, you must be kidding" or an "Oh neat!  Let
me get a goblet!" reaction.  I even had a lady tell me that if she
didn't have this ring on her finger she'd consider marrying me ...!

Yes, it was a fun event ...

Subject: killing blows

It occurs to me that the folk of the SCA are opperating under the handicap of 
what used to be an amusing fantacy and is now a missaprehension that we can no 
longer afford.  I refer to the concept of the "killing" blow.

A fighter is supposed to ask him(her)self, "if i had been wearing such and 
such a type of armor and had the sword that hit me posessed an edge, would it 
have killed me?" and if the answer is "yes" then the fighter "dies", crumpling 
to the ground and twiching or executing a neat back flip.

Now, I will admit that in a war a certain amount of killing goes on, 
especially among the foot soldiers, and that in period tourneys a certain 
number of deaths and permenant disablements were expected, especially in the 
melees, HOWEVER...

It is simply not plausible that in a tourney only the victor would have 
survived, or that every encounter between armed men was entered with the 
combatants thinking "one of us will not come out of this alive."  There are 
period descriptions of tourneys.  They were sporting events, all the ladies 
came to watch and cheer granting ribbons and sleeves and whatnot to those 
fighters whom they favored and afterward tables were spread with wonderfull 
banquets under the tents on the grass.  Sometimes people died.  more often 
they did not.  Think about it.  A fighter on the tourney circuit who 
invariably killed his opponants would soon find few who wished to meet him on 
the field of honor and many whos friends had died by his hand who would be 
glad to teach him moderation.  Also a fighter who is defeated and who must 
ransom his armour etc back from the victor may be good for a few more gold 
peices later, while a dead one isnt good for much at all.  In wars as well the 
richer knights were seised for ransom rather than killed whenever possible.

Church and state were united in their dissaproval of acctivities that 
diminished thier tax base and their supply of fighters in their defence.  
Dueling was frequently illegal (although even duels were not invariably 
fatal--one might fight only to first blood, and when pistols came in one didnt 
fire at ones opponant until one or the other dropped, on had only one shot, 
and deloping-firing into the air-was an opption).  Crusades were strongly 
encouraged and very popular, not only because of the booty obtainable, but 
because one could kill one's opponants (and also civilians, women, children, 
small dogs, and sheep) with the blessing of the church.

Enough.  I conclude that the question fighters should be asking themselves is, 
"if I were wearing such & such armor and had the blade that hit me had had an 
edge, would it have dissuaded me from wishing to fight further?"  A fighter 
who consistantly "kills" his opponant is hitting too hard, and the church, the 
state, his lady, and his fellow fighters should tell him so.

Message-Id: <Jun.21.14.47.39.1988.26440@straits.rutgers.edu>

Greetings good gentles.

The Knowne World Heraldic Symposium was held this past weekend in the
Barony of Forgotten Sea, Calontir.  The Laurel Queen of Arms, seven
Kingdom's Principal Heralds, and a dozen or so other members of the
College of Arms were present, as well as a host of other heralds from
Calontir, Ansteorra, the Middle, and elsewhere. (For me, the surprise
attendant was Koppel von Bayern, now living in Trimaris, and still an
active herald.  He was the second head herald of the East Kingdom,
before the office really had a title, back in AS 8 or so.  Alfgar, I
expect you'll be amused by this note.) 

The event was a great success, and I believe everyone enjoyed it.  In
addition to a day of classes on various heraldic subjects (including a
talk on Islamic Heraldry by Lord Da'ud ibn Auda, Star Principal
Herald), there were many discussions of revising the Rules for
Submissions and other issues facing the College of Arms.

There will probably be a new edition of the Rules for Submissions
published in early autumn.  These revised rules are a major
simplification of the existing rules, and should be much easier to
use for both heralds and non-heralds.  These rules will be published
in TI, and will be mass-mailed to every branch of the SCA, along with
other useful material for the local herald.

The lady Laurel also announced her intention to publish in TI a poll
of the populace, asking for input on an assortment of questions which
have been discussed at length over past years.  These questions will
cover such issues as the registration of household names and badges,
the registration of alternate personae, and the registration of
non-human names.  The idea will be to find out whether the opinions of
the College coincide with those of the populace, and if any changes
should be made on that basis.

Subj:	Bagpipes and surveys

 
To quote our local pursuivant on the subject of bagpipes.
	"Playing Scotch bagpipes is like drinking Scotch whiskey :
	 Never alone, never to excess, and NEVER before ten in the 
	 morning."
 
One of the Ice Dragons in years past (an ungodly huge arts and sciences
competition) had a bagpiper enter the instrumental music category.  One of
the queen's whims that year was No Bagpipes!  Since our calligraphers guild
has a large number of members, we put together a beautifully calligraphed
and illuminated petition to the queen.  We got back a beautifully calligraphed
and illuminated proclamation granting us our favor provided we supplied a
room for the queen to retreat to during the performance.  The scroll is still
in our Baronial History book.
 
At Marcon XX, the GoH was Larry Niven.  The evening before the filk competition,
Larry managed to hit ALL of the room parties he was invited to.  The following
morning, he was scheduled to judge the filk contest.  The first entrant
started playing bagpipes when Larry "suddenly remembered" he forgot to call his
agent that morning!  Hmmmmm!
 
Regarding surveys: a number of years ago, a reporter to a local paper was
invited to attend an event. (This was an out-of-area event for me.  I don't
remember where.)  Rather than just come for two minutes, take pictures and
leave, he came for the entire event, wore loaner garb and stayed for court and
feast.  It was announced that he had a survey that he would like people to take,
strictly on a volunteer basis.  He had fifty copies of the survey.  He ran out.
I don't remember all of the questions and results (a brief summary was posted
by the kitchen later in the evening) but there were some interesting results.
Average school level completed was way above mundane average.  MDs, PhDs, RNs
BAs, BSs, less than five percent of the responses were from people with only
a high school diploma. (not counting students still in school) Left handed
people comprised about FORTY PERCENT of the responses.  Computers/High Tech.
and Teaching were the mundane jobs listed by over two-thirds.  Average number
of books read in a typical week was 7.  Interestingly enough, when asked if
you could go back to your period, would you? most people replied no, stating
practical reasons like the Black Death, lack of needed medication, poor food,
not wanting to break friendships, etc.

I suggest that the PROPER solution is to use large unglazed earthenware
containers and splash water on the outside of them on hot days. Slightly
more practical would be to take a wicker basket and line it with a layer of
open cell foam. Keep all food in water tight containers, and wet the foam
thoroughly every morning. Throw a wet towel over the basket too.

The idea is to use evaporative cooling to stop things from baking dry and the
formation of condensation on the inside of the sealed bags.

Peasant bread was a lot thicker than store bought whole wheat. The denser
the bread, the longer it will keep. Try baking your own, it is truely not
difficult, merely time consuming.

The Coopers run a produce stand for the duration of the war so fresh
fruit, vegetables and dairy products can be bought daily.

Meat, vegetable or fruit pies need to be either hermetically sealed or
refrigerated or they will turn bad with horrifying speed. In period, food
was preserved by keeping it in honey, vinegar or brine. The other way was
to bake all of the mosture out, e.g. jerky, pasta and hard bread. Much labour
would be needed to turn such foods into attractive meals.

Two suggestions. Wet your headscarf at frequent intervals and try tasting
Gatorade about as often. Water and salt are not the only materials that
you lose through sweat. Gatorade supplies other essential electrolytes.

The other possibility is that you were suffering from sun poisoning, i.e.
not wearing enough sunblock. I find that I can get sunburnt in the shade of
most canopies. I have also found that cotton protects my skin better than
any other fiber.

I hope that you enjoy the war and come to sample some of my mead.

The bagpipes I can stand (even *like*, if they are played well), but I
have experienced other things less amusing: last year at Pennsic, I was
encamped with my household down in the bottoms, under runestone (and
real near the closed-off road out of camp).  Well, at about 6:30, I
started hearing this noise, which (in my sleepy state) I finally made
out as the muttering of Aiden.  Then I heard what he was cursing about:
there was this _noise_.  It was similar to music, but wasn't quite (no
instrument could sound like that): the soundtrack to Conan, coming from
an encampment over a bit.

It turns out that a certain Countess and Laurel, of a different kingdom
(in this case _real_ different) decided that it would be a good idea to
play Conan to help roust her fighters.  We (and others) complained to
them (and got a "She is nobility and a peer, who are you?" from a very
large Count) and to the Autocrat, who asked this person not to play it
before 8.  The next day, at 6:30 sharp: the same d*mn thing.

Now I can't speak for others, but I would expect any Peer of the Realm
to know better that to do this sort of thing.  It is sad that the concept
of courtesy is lost on these folks.

Maybe a well placed cross-bow bolt.  Maybe a champion-against-champion
fight for the right to possess the tape for the duration of the War.
Maybe a late night Ninja run...

Although I have no personal experience, I understand that there are
equestrian activities in several of the southwestern kingdoms, where
the outdoor season is longer and the cost of keeping horses is lower.
I think that the West has a Kingdom officer coordinating such
activity.

Greetings all!

Anyone who delights as I do in the interesting paths taken by language
over the years, will find great pleasure in the book "An Exaltation of
Larks".  This books is a compilation and discussion of period and
modern collective nouns, more often called "terms of venery" or
"venereal nouns", since they originally were invented for the beasts
of the hunt.  

In the 15th century, it appears to have been a courtly game to invent
and collect these terms, which were applied not only to animals and
birds, but also to people in various occupations.  They appear in
collections in many period books, notably those manuals on courtly
behavior exemplified by the Boke of St. Agnes.  A selection of such
words, as translated in "An Exaltation of Larks",

A sounder of boars
A skulking of foxes
A shrewdness of apes
A neverprosper of jugglers
A blarney of tapsters

I can list more if people are enjoying this...

The game is played in the SCa as well.  The debate over the proper
term for a crowd of heralds has gone on for years, and has produced:

A pun of heralds
A cry of heralds
A field of heralds
A semy of heralds
A shout of heralds
A court of heralds
A display of heralds
An achievement of heralds
...and so on.




PS: I will admit to having missed the joke, Dani.  What is sauegard?

I've seen horses at S.C.A. events very few times.  Some groups have an active
equestrian group; Mynydd Seren (Middle) had a pet horse ("Hussy") who was often
seen at demos and the Oliver Winery Festival.  I (practically a non-rider) was
once put up in full armor and was convinced I was going to fall off and break
my neck when my pigfaced bascinet stuck in the ground.  Morgan (of Elandris)
once assisted in marshalling the Woods Battle at Pennsic when Sir Logos'
radio gave out (she had brought horses that were stabled elsewhere, no horses
can be stabled at Cooper's Lake or even used at all now, if I remember correctly.
At the TYC they did ring jousting and I've seen some nice pictures of various
members of the chivalry in harness jousting at the ring.

Basic reasons for not using more horses are (a) cost and (b) safety.  (b) is
a dominating factor in events like the War.

I am unsure but the group around here does use horses (course it could be that
there are just some horse freaks hearabouts).
At any rate they never invited me so I didn't ask.

Greetings,
 
   I have only just begun reading this group, and learning more about
SCA.  It all seems very interesting.  However, one question keeps
tugging at my mind.  Are there any horses in SCA?  I'm fairly sure
that horses played an important role during the time period emphasized,
but I've seen them mentioned in discussions here only once.  (Someone
referred to "a lady on a horse".)

   If horses are involved, are they used often?  What roles do they
play in SCA events?  I'd be very interested to hear of anyone's
experiences with (or stories involving) horses in SCA.  Thank you!

Subject: the rennaissance man

of course we want as many people as possible to do as many things as possible 
everyone has more fun that way although of course there is something to be 
said for doin one thing well...

it is hard to think of ways to compete in medieval arts in a way that would 
have been done in the middle ages.  His Grace, Duke Cariadoc, suggested a fair 
in which people presented their work as craftsmen and the winner was awarded 
"royal patronage"  this would be difficult for performers

as for crown tourneys selecting for sword jocks, i was under the impression 
that this was a design feature...

At the An Tir/West War (or the West/An Tir War if you're from the West)
just this passed weekend, there was a piper practicing a 7am on Saturday.
He was at the other end of the site - far away from any tents - and I have
to say it was lovely. We who were awake enjoyed the addition to the
atmosphere of the weekend and those still asleep were not disturbed.
And THAT'S the way I like pipes.

I've only seen horses used at an SCA event once. It was at the coronation
of Eirik and Meagan - July of AS XXII (1988). The event was held at a
private site and the owners (SCA folk) had horses. Meagan rode one in the
procession to the thrones. (The horse was in "garb" too.)

The same horse was ridden a few times over that weekend by the lady
who owned it. It looked really neat - the lady wore a green and blue
quarted gown and the horse had a matching ??? (sorta like a tabard for
a horse.)

Trouble with horses is you have to have a place to keep them and be able to
afford the them and the SCA at the same time.

Message-ID: <880616-070619-2042@Xerox>

I am forwarding this for a friend (Orilee J Ireland-Delfs) who can not send mail
to the ArpaNet.



--------------------------------------------------------------------
First, let me introduce myself.  I am Lady Orianna vander Delft of Winfield.  I
live on the eastern fringes of the Barony of Thescorre (Rochester, NY) and have
been active in the SCA for about 8 years.

After reading the comments about "swordjocks" vs. well-rounded fighters, I
thought I would tell you about an event that my husband (Lord Friedrich
Tomasson) and I have autocratted for two years in a row now and will be holding
again next year.

We borrowed the idea from the Kingdom of An Tir (it's amazing what ideas you can
get from reading other Kingdom newsletters).  The event is called Sergeant's and
Yeoman's and the idea is to run a competition that involves seven areas of
expertise.

The areas are: martial arts, strategy & tactics, heraldry, gaming, dance,
performance, and courtesy.  Next year we are adding calligraphy.  Each
contestant selects one area of the martial arts to compete in, either rattan,
fencing, or archery (we added fencing since Thescorre has a large fencing
group).  Besides competing in a martial tournament, the contestants must take a
written test in strategy and tactics (SCA and historical references) and a
written test in heraldry (SCA - do you know what your kingdom arms look like?),
compete in a gaming tournament, perform three common dances before a group of
judges, perform a piece of some type (we accept "No S**t there we were" as well
as songs, stories, dance, etc.) for a group of judges, and be judged on courtesy
throughout the day.  Final scores in all areas are added up and the one with the
best score (depending upon your scoring system, we rank by 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)
wins a belt.  We give three belts, one for rattan, one for fencing, and one for
archery.  At our first S&Y, the lady who won the Fencing belt came in dead last
in the fencing tournament.

Everyone enjoys participating.  We also run regular tournaments in rattan,
fencing, archery, and gaming (with Godiva Chocolates as prizes) for those who
wish to compete but not toward a belt.

Next year we plan on adding the calligraphy to the competition.  Each competitor
has to submit a letter of intent calligraphed in their own hand to the Baroness
of Thescorre.  We recieved some beautiful pieces of work this year and hope to
see more next year.

Just thought you all would be interested!

Orianna

     But it was *close*! The only thing that saved him was that neither
Lord Wulfshal McWombat nor I could agree on the proper, period, way to 
perform a scotoctomy.

     I like bagpipes as well as the next person. (Probaby more, since I 
grew up in a traditional Scots household and my Granddad played them
every Sunday). But not at 6:00a and not 30ft from my encampment. Especially
not that Sunday.

If I even think of this a little I get terrible sympathetic pains
in the oddest places.

"Well son..one shouldn't judge another's sexual preference
should one?"   :-) 

As the originator of this line of thought, I
wanted to point out that I'm not picking
on bagpipes. I'm actually thinking of an 
experience I had on a Sunday School retreat.
My cabin-mates convinced me to go outside and
play reveille (sp?) on my trumpet at 2:00 am.
This is of course when I was young and 
impressionable (instead of just impressionable).
It was interesting to see how quickly middle-
age counselors can move when inspired to 
confiscate my horn. Anyways the bagpipe was
the closest parallel I could think of SCA-wise
but again I wasn't really singling pipes out.
I like the beasties and am thinking of 
learning Uillean pipes...some day..

	Are you sure you've got the right calender there?  On mine it says
that Pennsic week would be Monday the 15th through Sunday the 21st, which 
matches the Pale's 15-22 (Monday for clean up.)

	As long as we're on Pennsic, they've added a new battle this year,
Queen's Champions, which brings us to a total of 8 points.  How are we
going to resolve ties? (If we need to, they may have one of the battles
counting more than the others.)  As soon as I get the time I'll type in
the details of the events this year.

Anyone hear results from St. Basils (I forgot the barony, so shoot me.
I believe it was in or near (mundane) Shrevesport, La.)

I'm particulary interested in a small group from what *used* to be
the Shire of the Swamp, but there's a chance it's change name and hands.
Specifically, my brother:  6', very fair-skinned, way past shoulder-length
strawberry-blonde hair, his armour would be well-made plate, and his
colours are green and white.  His friends and companions are mostly
(mundane) soldiers from Ft. Polk.

thx in advance.

Oops.  Yup, I goofed.  These are the correct dates, although the days
of the week which I gave are correct: the event opens Monday 15
August, opening ceremonies are Tuesday 16 August, and the battles and
all are on the weekend of 19-21 August.


Sorry about that.

All of the recent talk of music in the Society, and filksinging in 
particular, reminded me of one filk that I started a while back, and never
finished. It isn't appropriate to much except for post-revels, because the
tune is quite modern, but I'd love to get some more verses for it. The tune
(and spirit) are from the SF mainstay, "Banned From Argo". A sample verse:

Bound For Pennsic

Chorus:

And we're bound for Pennsic, everyone,
Yes, we're bound for Pennsic, just to have us a little fun.
We're gonna have a battle there for just three days or four,
At Cooper's Lake, at the Great Pennsic War.

We had a mighty fighter, who was powerful indeed.
He lacked only one skill: he never learned quite how to read.
He died amongst the leeches, in a tragical mistake;
His gravestone reads, "Here lies a knight,
Consumed by Cooper's Lake".

(Repeat chorus, etc.)

Anyone have a filksinging bent, who'd like to contribute some verses?

     Those  who forget history--and the English language--may  be 
condemned  to mangle both.  Historian Anders Henriksson,  a five-
year veteran of the university classroom, has faithfully recorded 
his  freshman  students'  more striking  insights  into  European 
history.   Possibly  as  an  act  of  vengeance,  Henriksson  has 
assembled  these fractured fragments into a chronological  narra-
tive from the Middle Ages to the present.

     During the Middle Ages, everyone was middle aged. Church and 
state were co-operated. Middle Evil society was made up of monks, 
lords,   and  surfs.  After  a  revival  of  infantile  commerce, 
merchants appeared. Those roamed from town to town exposing them-
selves  and  organizing  big  fairies  in  the  countryside.  The 
Crusades were expeditions by Christians who were seeking to  free 
the holy land (the "Home Town" of Christ) from the Islams.
     In  the 1400 hundreds most Englishmen were perpendicular.  A 
class of ycowls arose. Finally, Europe caught the Black Death. It 
was spread from port to port by inflected rats.  The plague  also 
helped  the  emergence  of English as the  national  language  of 
England, France, and Italy.
     The Middle Ages slimpared to a halt. The renesance bolted in 
from  the blue.  Life reeked with joy.  Italy became robust,  and 
more individuals felt the value of their human being.  Italy,  of 
course,  was  much  closer to the rest of the  world,  thanks  to 
northern Europe.  Man was determined to civilise himself and  his 
brothers, even if heads had to roll! It became sheik to be educa-
ted.  Europe  was  full  of incredable churches  with  great  art 
bulging  out of their doors.  Renaisance merchants were beautiful 
and almost lifelike.
     The  Reformnation happened when German nobles resented  that 
tithes were going to the pope, thus enriching Catholic coiffures. 
The popes were usually Catholic. An angry Martin Luther nailed 95 
theocrats to a church door. Theologically, Luthar was into reori-
entation  mutation.  Anabaptist services tended to be  migratory. 
Monks  went right on seeing themselves as worms.  The last Jesuit 
priest died in the 19th century.
     After  the refirmation were wars both foreign and  infernal. 
If  the  Spanish  could gain the Netherlands they  would  have  a 
stronghold  throughout northern Europe that would include  Italy, 
Burgangy,  central Europe and India thus surrounding France.  The 
German  Emperor's  lower passage was blocked by  the  French  for 
years and years.
     Louis  XIV became King of the Sun.  He gave people food  and 
artillery. If he didn't like someone, he sent them to the gallows 
to row for the rest of their lives. Vauban was the royal minister 
of flirtation.
     In  Russia,  the  17th century was known as the time of  the 
bounding of the serfs. Russian nobles wore clothes to humor Peter 
the  Great.  Peter filled his government with accidental  people; 
orthodox priests became government antennae.
     The  enlightenment was a reasonable time.  Voltaire wrote  a 
book  called Candy that got him into trouble.  Philosophers  were 
unknown  yet,  and  the fundamental stake was  one  of  religious 
tolerance slightly confused with defeatism.

     France was in a serious state. Taxation was a great drain on 
the  state budget.  The French revolution was accomplished before 
it happened.  The revolution catapaulted into Napolean.  Napoleon 
was ill with bladder problems and was very tense and  unrestrain-
ed.
     History started in 1815. Industrialization was precipitating 
in England.  Problems were so complexicated that in Paris, out of 
a  population of 1 million people,  2 million able bodies were on 
the loose.
     The middle class was tired and needed a rest.  The old order 
could  see  the lid holding down new ideas  beginning  to  shake. 
Among  the goals of the chartists were universal suferage and  an 
anal parliment.
     A  new  time  zone of national unification roared  over  the 
horizon.  Founder  of the new Italy was  Cavour,  an  intelligent 
Sardine  from  the north.  Culture formented from its tip to  its 
top.  Dramatized were adventures in seduction and abortion. Music 
reeked with reality. Wagner was master of music, and when he died 
they labeled his seat "historical."
     World  War  I broke out about 1912-1914.  At war people  get 
killed,  and then they aren't people any more, but friends. Peace 
was  proclaimed at Versigh,  which was attended by General  Loid, 
Primal  Minister  of England.  President Wilson arrived  with  14 
pointers. In 1917, Lenin revolted Russia.
     Germany was displaced after WW1.  This gave rise to  Hitler, 
who  remilitarized the Rineland over a squirmish between  Germany 
and  France.  Mooscalini  rested  his foundations  on  8  million 
bayonets  and  invaded  Hi Lee Salasy.  Germany  invaded  Poland, 
France  invaded  Belgium,   and  Russia  invaded  everybody.  War 
screeched  to  an  end when a nukleer explosion  was  dropped  on 
Heroshima.  A  whole  generation  had been wipe  out,  and  their 
forlorne families were left to pick up the peaces.
     The last stage is us.

	Sounds like a good time to put what we have been talking about on
here to practice.  Get together, put together a note to the effect that
you have observed this tendency, and send it to the Earl Marshall.

	The answer to the why is probably simple curiousity.  The answer
to the second question would be because most of us are probably interested
in the results too.

	You mean you've *never* wondered what some of us do in real
life?  And you've never wondered if there really is a majority of

Subject: Demographics and "true stories"

There is a local Carolingian story which I heard firsthand from one of the 
participants involving filling out the "random" census forms of the US 
government.  The household concerned is/was fairly large and the sections 
describing the various relationships between people in the house were vastly 
amusing.  I remember such examples as "thain" and "master" particularly.  I 
wonder if the individual who logged this response in the database did it or if 
it got logged under crank replies.  

Anyway, filling out forms can be fun.  I would respond favorably to an SCA 
demographic form provided that it was treated with some humor and a good bit 
of salt and sense.

As an aside, I unintentionally learned one answer this past weekend. Having
become irreversibly awake at 6 AM, and after performing the morning's
ablutions, I was left with little do to for a couple hours, and about 7 AM
decided it would be a good idea to get a jump on the day's piping by working
over my (ailing) pipes.
 
To this end I departed camp, passing fen and forest, to a distance that my
experience said would be safe, where I could not possibly be heard at all in
camp, and proceeded to warm and tune them up. Unfortunately I was not aware
of the rather unusual acoustics of the area at that hour which caused the 
pipes to be heard clearly through the entire camp!
 
I became aware of this unfortunate turn of events after a Scot showed up and
informed me that he, on the furthest end of the encampment, had been roused
by the sound of the pipes and what a wonderful way to be awakened it was!
 
With some embarrassment I quit and returned to camp, to be greeted by all and 
sundry with compliments on the fine playing, and all apologies of mine were 
simply waved away. To be sure, I suspect that those who don't care for the
pipes merely kept silent, but I appreciated the comment from one woman who 
had been up all night tending her horse: She was just getting to sleep, heard 
the pipes and thought, "Oh ****, what idiot is playing bagpipes at this 
hour...  wait, that's not half-bad... that's really nice... zzzzZZZZZ..".
 
Later in the day I tested the acoustics of the area, and found that the sound
of the pipes wouldn't carry even a quarter of the distance it apparently did
that early morning, that it carried only about as far as my normal experience
indicated. (Valuing my hide, I ran no more tests of early morning acoustics.)
 
I guess the lessons in this are:
  There is appreciation for an instrument played reasonably well, *
  Beware of treacherous acoustics :-), and,
  Playing bagpipes at 7AM is not invariably fatal! **

marching over rough ground!)

Subject: Things

Two comments, one on dance, the other on scouting:

We've always done set and turn single the way Arval described (both step left,
then right, then turn over the left shoulder). As far as I know, there is no
period documentation for English Country on this matter (I *really* wish Baron
Patri were on the net...). This is similar to the way we do it for allemandes,
however, (allemandes have the same, plus an "up-down" at the end of each step),
and I think that we have better documentation for those. If I can get ahold of
Patri, I'll ask if he has any idea.

On scouting:

Well, I've spoken to Lady Sendera on the subject, and it is vastly more complex
than I have ever dreamed. We appear to have BOD policies interacting with local
ones to become more complicated than either could be on its own. I'm too tired
to recount the whole conversation right now, but there were a couple of useful
clarifications. Most importantly, the Curia has not (yet) ordained that member-
ship is necessary. The line in the letter was:

"...because of rulings at the last East Kingdom Curia Regis you *must* supply
me with proof of the following information: age & SCA membership."

What actually happened was that Curia decided to talk (at the *next* Curia)
about requiring membership for some large subset of fighting participants,
including fighters and scouts. To cover themselves, the EK Scouts office
decided to ask for membership now. The wording was simply unfortunate.

I was pleased to discover that the EK Scouting Office is not going mad;
many of the rules have, apparently, been foisted onto them from above. I'm
still unhappy about the rules, but I'm glad to know that the people running
the scouting are trying to improve the situation, rather than make it worse.

My understanding, as taught by Master Christopher Darras, is that the
set & turn single is "single left, single right, turn over the left
shoulder in four beats".  Both lord and lady do the same steps, so
they move in opposite directions.  In dances in which this figure
follows a pair of symettric figures (e.g., arming), the second set &
turn single reverses all directions.

Gary,

Music is alive and well in the SCA. I am in San Antonio and
have been involved in things liking directing and singing in
madrigal choirs, playing in a recorder consort, and playing
for things fron court to dancing. Here in Ansteorra (Texas/Ok.)
we even have a College of Bards which is a group organising
and supporting bardic/minstrel performance. Basically, like
anything in the SCA, if something was done in the time
period of concern (Middle ages, pre-1600, whatever) there
is probably someone recreating it or interested in it. 

Different places will have different ideas about music and
performance. Here in Bjornsborg we have many Viking personas
and campfires often have people getting up to tell stories and recite
sagas. As befits the image, these can get very bawdy/humorous
very quickly. Other places may consider this poor taste..who's
to say. Know that even in this environment my nadrigal groups
went over extremely well.

As an aside you never *have* to do anything in the SCA (such
as learn to play the Lyre). However, I have never run across
someone playing one and it may prove to be something uniquely yours.

Filk songs (which I saw mentioned somewhere else) are recognizable
songs with different words set to them. One of the more
glaring examples might be "Silent Knight, Unconcious Knight" 
sung to the tune of the Christmas carol. The concept of filk
songs itself is a period idea but this can be an area of
controversy. (No flames please, I am not for or against them
just stating the facts 'mam.) I might sing the preceding Filk
at 2:00am when everyone has gotten stupid, but I wouldn'y sing
it at court. But that is just my personal call in this area.

Basically with a little common sense (how would *you* react to
bagpipes at 7:00 in the morning?) almost any form of
entertainment would usually be greatly appreciated. Good Luck!!

There is something about both the unstated assumptions behind this and the way
it was stated that distresses me.  I was going to suggest that the best way to
accomplish this goal might be to talk with, and get to know, a large number of
Scadians, but it's fairly clear that that's not what was meant -- though
perhaps it should have been.

I take it that what you want is a demographic analysis of the society.  WHY?

Subject: Set and Turn Single?
Message-Id: <UWg5Zey00UwBF2M0U-@andrew.cmu.edu>

How do you set and turn single?

It's not that we don't know how; we know too well.  We have over half a dozen
methods in use -- typically simultaneously, within the same dance!

Our 'generic' STS is a single to the left followed by a single to the right for
the man, while the lady takes a single to the right followed by a single to the
left.  Man's right hand is holding lady's left hand.  They then both turn in
place (so that the joined hands initially move towards the man's left).
Variations:  Sometimes the singles get changed to triples:  left-right-left,
right-left-right.  Sometimes the single, instead of left-together becomes
step-onto-left-kick-right-foot-leftward.  Sometimes this is all done without
holding hands.  Sometimes the turn single becomes a walk around a small circle.
 All of these may be done with small precise steps, with leaps, or with
anything in between.

More variations:  While the man does single-left/single-right, the lady does
likewise, thus moving in the opposite directions.  Or they start with
single-right.  Or the steps, instead of to the side, are at forty-five degree
angles forward, so the dancers are moving towards each other.

I'm *not* trying for an exhaustive list of all ways set-and-turn-single can be
done.  I'm cataloguing ways I've *seen* it done.  And when half a dozen of
these are all being used by various dancers in the same dance, that dance
becomes a bit painful to watch.

QUESTIONS:  How do you standardize?  *Do* you standardize?  Does anybody have
documentary evidence favoring some of these steps over others?  Advice?

Good Lord Justin: Peace.

For what it's worth, allow me to supply some background.

The move to formally organize scouting in the East springs from the
general requirement that anyone participating in combat must be
authorized by the Marshallate.  It has been brewing for about two
years, and is remarkably poorly organized.  I strongly recommend that
you (and anyone else with a legitimate opinion) boil your comments
down to a presentable letter, and send it to the King, the Earl
Marshall, and the Captain of Scouts.  I personally have been
suggesting that scout authorization be viewed as part of the job of
the marshallate, and that the same philosphical standards apply, i.e.,
safety first.  Unfortunately, there have been deeply political
arguments involved with this thing, the upshot of which has been that
the six or seven people actually doing the work have not been given
any guidance at all.

Curia did require that anyone participating in combat (fighters,
scouts, combat archers, etc.) be at least 18 years old or be an
emancipated minor.  However, there is no grounds for requiring proof
of membership to be a scout or a fighter or anything except an officer
of the SCA.  This point particularly should be brought to the
attention of the appropriate Kingdom officers, because somebody has
really gotten their info mixed up.

Lord Arval recently sent a test to alt.sca, saying it should appear on
the newsgroup and not on the mailing list. 

I dont know if the following is his intent, but I immediately wondered
if he had sent a similar message to the list, trying to get it there
and not to the newsgroup.

Again, I stress I dont know if this is what he is trying to do, but I
ask rather fervently that any attempt to have things on the mailing
list and not on the net PLEASE NOT SUCCEED!

there are some sites that DO NOT RECEIVE the mailing list, and ONLY
receive the newsgroup. Our local news admin has said to me that He
Does Not Support Private Mailing Lists, and that he will Strongly
Oppose people getting volumes of Mail when there is a News Group. He
has stated he is going to ask Danulf to cut off our mail feed as soon
as the newsgroup is stable...  I dont know if he has done this yet or
not.

He has forced various other mailing lists to go similar routes. Yes, I 
think he is being a twit, but I am not in a position to do anything 
about it.

My good friends,
   While I am not currently a member of your group, I am very interested in it.
There is not currently a chapter of the SCA at our University, but several
friends of mine are going to try to start one this fall. I have had a good bit
of experience with vocal (and a little instrumental) music (including a musical
tour of Finland, where we visited two decent castles and the truly awesome
Tampere Cathedral), and I was wondering if there is an established role of a
bard or minstrel sort of person in the SCA. Would I have to learn to play the
lyre?

would like the input.

Secondly,  what would you like to see at the archery which wasn't
present in previous years.

Thirdy,  HELP!!!  We are going to need as many people as we can get on

Subject: The electronic Domesday Boke


[This article, and the one following, were posted to alt.sca a week ago, and
seem to have gotten lost in transmission. Thus, I'm posting them directly to
the mailing list. If you see them twice, my apologies.]

Greetings, gentles all!

Danulf (the moderator of SCAnet) and I are beginning to work on creating an
electronic Domesday Boke, a sort of "phone book" for SCAdians on the net. To
this end, I am putting out a call for entries. The items to be in the book are
the following:

1) SCA and mundane names
2) SCA and mundane locations (ie, shire & kingdom, town & state, zip)
3) Titles and offices (*briefly*; 1/2 line max!)
4) net address (Inter/ARPAnet format strongly preferred)
5) Interests (*briefly*; one line maximum!)
6) Are you/do you want to be on the SCA mailing list? (which you probably
   already are, since you're reading this).
7) Do you want your address publically known? 

Note that this is the same information that Danulf requests for joining the
mailing list. This is no coincidence: we are planning to merge our databases.
Thus, if you have already sent all of this information to Danulf, there is no
need to send it to me; I'll be getting it from him.

The only fields that are *required* for entry in the Domesday are SCA name and
net address. All other fields are optional, but encouraged.

Note that mundane location does not mean full address; I will not enter full
addresses if I receive them. This is just so that people can get some feeling
for where the people that they are communicating with are from.

If you have many titles, try to trim them down to the most important ones.
The order of the ETC is well known and respected, and covers a lot.

Please keep your net address brief. If the only way to get to you is via
UUCP bang address (ie, x!y!justin), then pick one or two *good* paths, and
put those in. I will likely keep net addresses down to one line, and I will
*certainly* not take more than two lines. Thus, complex Usenet graphs will
*not* be accepted. Choose one from the backbone that works well.

I'm assuming that most people will answer "yes" to #7. If you really want
an unlisted address, tell me, and I'll put you in the database, but not
the published book. To a certain degree, I'm willing to act as a clearing-
house for these unlisted addresses, but don't abuse it.

The book will be distributed via the net once we're finished, probably in
a month or three. I'll probably make a limited number of printed copies
to sell at events for a nominal fee, for people whose net access is 
erratic.

Questions? Suggestions? Entries (I hope!)? Send them to me! Please *don't*
put your entries on the net, unless you absolutely can't get through to
me.

See ya'll in the yellow pages...

Subject: Bureaucracy & scouting

[Another re-post.]

Greetings to all from Justin du Coeur. The following is a bit of a tirade,
about the current state of one aspect of SCA bureaucracy. Those gentles who
do not want their blood pressure raised a hair should probably skip onto the
next message; I'm in a *very* sarcastic mood, and am likely to be a bit rude.

I look at the SCA's bureaucracy with growing horror. I know that it's not a 
new problem; I have issues of the baronial newsletter dating back 12-15 years
that were already complaining about the bureaucracy. But I think that things 
are getting rather extreme.

Now, I recognize that a certain amount of bureaucracy is necessary; the mundane
world *loves* to heap rules upon rules. A certain amount of bureaucracy is
even beneficial; I think that Arval's comment about keeping awards somewhat
consistent across geographic boundries is a good point. However, there seems
to be an increasing tendency towards unnecessary (and to my eyes harmful)
bureaucracy. The particular topic of the day is scouting in the East Kingdom.

When I went to my first Pennsic, four years ago, I discovered the pastime of
scouting. It suited my skills ideally; I'm not strong, but I'm pretty fast
and reasonably forest-wise. I was hooked up with Branswatch, the East's
guerilla fighting outfit, where you had to be fast just to keep up with the
armored fighters (much less keep ahead of them). I would scout with Branswatch
until they split up/got killed, then generally go freelance, keeping the
Eastern armies appraised of each others' movements. I broke a lot of the
"normal" rules of scouting, but did quite well in that war, and the two
following it.

About a year and a half ago, an official EK scouts office came into being.
This office had the task of "organizing" the scouts. I didn't care for this
idea much, but didn't have much idea of how to object to it publically.
Since I wasn't at Pennsic last year, I didn't realize just *how*
organized this office was trying to be. More recently, I've been hearing
rumors that one has to pre-authorize to become a scout, that one *must*
hook up with a unit, and such things. This disturbed me greatly, but I
simply decided that I wouldn't scout if I couldn't deal with the red tape
involved.

The last straw came last night. I received a rather belated letter from the
scout's office, which I will quote parts from.

The intro: Unto Mark Wales (sic) ...

The gist of the first sheet is that one *must* not only be trained, but
must be authorized as a scout before one will be allowed into the woods
battle at Pennsic. And that training is not only that one must be provably
safe in the woods, but must be trained to do everything *correctly*. Even
fighters don't have to go through this!

The real kicker is the bottom of the first sheet, though. After spending
several sentences telling me how I must contact one of my Local Marshalls
to be trained, and that ONLY (emphasis theirs) the signature of one of the
Local Marshalls will be accepted on my Qualification card, I go to the name
of the first of the listed Local Marshalls, which is:

		Justan (sic) de (sic) Cour (sic)
		c/o Mark Whatts (sic)

So, it appears that *I* am one of the only two people qualified to say
that I am qualified. Great. It appears to me that this bureaucracy is not
only a bad idea, but the one hand doesn't even know what the other is
saying. A badly run bureaucracy is the *only* thing worse than a good
bureaucracy, to my mind.

Then I get to the second sheet. According to this, the last Curia ordained
that, to be a scout, I must send *proof* of membership and age. They
suggest sending photocopies of my Driver's Licence and SCA membership 
card. And, just to make it complete, they list at the bottom the 
information they have on me, wherein *every* important field (SCA name,
Mundane name, address, and phone number) is not only out of date, but
downright *wrong*.

What has happened to scouting? Four years ago, this was what you did if
you wanted to get some exercise in the forest battle, but weren't an
authorized fighter. Now, you *aren't* allowed to participate if you're
under 18 (BOD ruling), you must go through a course of training, and
you must be an SCA member to participate. Even fighters don't have to
go through this! F**k it. Pardon my French, but this bureaucracy has
managed to completely eliminate any traces of *fun* from scouting. It's
no longer something that you do at the War to enjoy yourself; now, it's
work. I fully expect them to introduce awards for scouting within two
years; the award-driven mentality is, in my experience, closely tied to
the bureaucratic one (after all, if it isn't fun anymore, you have to have
some reason to do it). Sorry, I shan't be scouting at Pennsic anymore.

This is one of the major problems I'm having with the Society today. It
isn't bureaucracy per se that I object to, but unnecessary bureaucracy.
I could understand all of the rigamarole about making sure that scouts
were properly trained (well, not *all* of it, but at least some) if we
were still allowing 12-year-olds into the woods. But we aren't; you have
to be an adult to go in! I can understand *encouraging* people to get
some amount of training, so that they will be more effective as scouts,
but *requiring* it? And what possible justification is there for 
requiring proof of membership? Are we really at the point where gentles
who aren't members are considered to be un-people?

It seems to me that things are worsening, gradually. I ask everyone who is
in a position of power: *think* before you make a rule. Is this rule
necessary? Is it worth the small bit of additional stratification it adds
to the SCA? Remember, it isn't the big rules that are the problem, but the
small ones. When BOD makes a grandly stupid decision (which they do about
once every two years), *everyone* in the Known World tells them so. If your
new rule is stupid, it's not so likely that it will be noticed until it
has been locked into India Ink iron. Remember: a guideline is almost
*always* better than a rule, and common sense is usually better than a
guideline.

Please, everyone, work on this problem. Otherwise, within five years or
so, I'm going to find myself in a position of having to join (or found)
a splinter group, just so that I can have some *fun*. And that would be
very, very sad.

In service to the Society (but dreading the day that he has to start filling
out paperwork in order to *dance*),

I recently saw this movie.  It was a fairly mediocre though mildly pleasant 
amateur movie.  It seemed a lot less like the SCA than a carny with cult 
overtones reflecting disillusionment with today's society.  Also, Movies that
have people distaining media productions somehow are missing a crucial link in
there somewhere (a mild reflection on the directing there) 

If you want to see motorcyclists at a RenFair jousting and angsting while 
trying to figure out what they're doing in life and sometimes having a good 
time in the process, then this is an ok movie.  But it still reminds me much 
more of some YomsVikings I know than SCA'ers.  

This is the second time I've sent this out.  Sorry if you got this twice.

*sigh*

Yes, the fate of scouting does seem to have fallen into the 
hands of the bureaucrats.  I was very shocked to find out 2 weeks
before pennsic that I had to authorize as a scout in order to
participate in the woods battle.  This was one little piece of 
red-tape I was able to cut through, although it wasn't pretty.

It seems as though it is currently more difficult to be a scout than
it is to be a fighter.  Hell... as I understand it, you don't
necessarily have to be a member to be an authorized fighter, and
fighting has considerably more potential for harm than scouting.  Why
then, is it harder to be a scout?  

  The other major problem that has been recurring for the past few
years is the matter of protection and such.  Half the of BMDL's scout
helms were made *AT* Pennsic with close supervision of the marshalls
just so we could get helms that passed.  We were trying hard to avoid
getting screwed the way we did a year before when most of our scouts
were told ~30 minutes before the battle started that their helms
weren't up to spec, and they couldn't enter the woods.  It seems that
there is no official guidelines as to what a helm should and should
not be, but everyone has there own idea as to what should be allowed.
The open faced helm that was perfectly legal two years ago has now
been deemed unsafe.

I wasn't too thrilled with the helm I wore last year at war.  It
served very well at blocking vision and restricting hearing, and all
and all, cutting down my efficiency as a scout.  The saving grace was
that it wasn't what seemed to be the standard midrealm scouting helm
which looks far too similar to a fighters helm for me to be
comfortable with.  Frankly, I have no desire to have a fighter mistake
me for an enemy fighter, and take a few swings at me.  (I generally
don't let them get that close) The open faced helms that *USED* to be
legal seemed to serve their purpose well, and I'd really like to see
them return.


I am in favor of giving new scouts some basics on not getting hurt.
It would also be a win to teach people what poison ivy looked like,
and that chivalry isn't just for fighters anymore. One thing that I
have stressed to the new scouts that I recruit is that you are there
at Pennsic to have fun.  If what you are doing isn't fun, then
reconsider why you are doing it.  People seem to be making it more and
more difficult to keep scouting fun.  If it doesn't look like it will
be fun, I probably won't do it.

enough ramblings for the moment...

	Giants Dance sounded like an interesting event last year and this 
year too, but the idea the it is close enough to anything in the Middle
to be feasable is silly.  Here in Dragon's Mark (Lexington, KY), we are
about as close as you can get to the site and still be in the Middle, 
and we're 8 to 10 hours away I've been told.  To get to the center 
of the Middle is another 5 or so hours.  So the Middle's participation
has been necessarily limited.  Add to the distance the fact that this
event has been scheduled so close to a previously established Midrealm-
Meridian event (Border Raids) and it isn't very likely that a significant
number of us attend.

	Agreed, but as a fighter I place safety first.  I havn't seen an
 arrow break *yet*, but I think it is just a matter of time.

	In related news, the West just banned golf-tube arrows...

Hmm since it seems that many of you may be un aware of it I would like to inform
you that there is another list dealing with things SCAdian. It is a csnews
discussion. To find out about it send an interactive message to
CSNEWS@MAINE (bitnet), I suggest starting with "help", but you will want to pay
close attention to csbb stuff. It is all UNDIGESTED!!! lately its been a bit
quite since there was a larger volume and readership of this list. But if anyone
else likes undigested mail please join it.

M'Lord Moderator,

An apparent mix-up has caused the SCA digests to be sent to an incorrect
address.  Please do not send the digests to RUSSELL@UMCINCOM.BITNET
or RUSSELL@CINCOM.UMD.EDU.  Although this is, in fact, my account, it
is not on my system, and the system manager gets rather annoyed at my
receiving large amounts of mail on her system.  Please instead send
the digests to RUSSELL@KING.ENG.UMD.EDU.  

I was receiving the SCA messages there before the digests, and I received
digest number two there, but I haven't heard anything else until now when I
find digest number 14 (What happened to 3 through 13???) sent to this 
different account.  It would make me very happy if you could take the time
to untangle this web.  Thank you very much.

Good gentles--

     A brief question here - when does a person's membership actually
start?
     I understand that for proof-of-membership the EK scout command
will take a photocopy of check and membership application...
     People have told me that they've gotten a kingdom newsletter for
3 months and still not seen their membership card...
     If one is planningon participating in Pennsic fighting, how much
processing time should be allowed?

I am interested in finding out what the average member of the society is like.
The best way to accomplish this it seems to me is to give a survey of some sort.
I have a rough questionaire semi-prepared and would like to work with someone to

hammer it out and maybe give it to a few people.
  If anyone is interested please drop me a note.

To any and all, I am begining to get desperate.
I am seriously considering forming a japanese persona, but I need to know
some things.
I have never seen a device for a japanese persona. Do they use traditional
banner types, steal english devices and methods of constructs, or what?

What terms do they use when addressing the royalty.

I am also interested in any impressions you may have of japanese personas.

In SCA Digest #12, Magnus de Cnoc an Iora (mka JOEL WELLING
<WELLING@CPWSCA.PSC.EDU> ) writes about restructuring the Registrar's Office.
He mentions some problems with the computer system the Office uses.  I offer
some information on that subject.

Not long ago I received a form letter from the Registrar in which I was
informed that my membership was about to expire.  Is this part of the
unproducable list to which you refer?

In the copy of the BOD Minutes I received last week, there is some discussion
about this.  They are thinking of replacing the computer with a 386-class
machine and a real database.  Naturally, there will be some problems in the
transition from the old machine to the new.  As I recall, the BOD Minutes
speak of rewriting the system rather than porting the old COBOL code.

Subject:  Sca stories

Hmm Sca stories ok here one I heard ~ 8 years ago in adenveldt at one of my
first armourers meetings, you have probably heard it.

   It seems that there was this member of the society whom was interested in
making chainmail. Well he went to the local sages and was instructed in the arts
of rolling wire into little springs, cutting said wore and connecting that wire
into that intricate mesh known as chain mail. Well this young member proved to
be quite adept at it and went from making steel pot holders to chain belts.
After he had become skilled in the art he decded to make his greatest piece to
date... a full chain shirt complete with long sleaves, and he would add matching
gauntlet backings. So all through the winter he worked on this project, fore
swearing fighter practice, homework, and other such minor disturbances. When in
the sping he looked upon his creation and it was in truth a thing of beauty.
Unfortunately the member had become so indebted for wire and such that he was
forced to take a part time job at a local conveniance store. While working there
the member had noticed a slight pauch he had developed from spending so much
time chain mailing and not fighting and other such vigorous activities. So he
decided to wear his chain shirt and gloves under his jacket while working. He
worked and wore for many a day when one night in the wee hours of morn a base
rogue crept into the members store and attempted to perforate the hale members
back. We can only imagine the shock on the varlets face as the member turned
around to see what the person who had tapped his back wanted. Now our member was
not the brightest of men but he was by no means slow so when he saw a rather
stuned looking person with a knife in one hand he quickly put 2 and 2 together
and proceeded with his instinctive reaction to the situation as he viewed it,
to wit, he punched the scoundrel. Now remeber not only was our valient member
wearing a great weight of steel on his arms he had been wearing it for days and
had built up his strength doing so. The blow was so devasting (or perhaps he
was still in shock from having his knife BOUNCE off the members back) that the
knave fell unconscious at the members feet. The bemused member called the local
constabulary to report the attempted robbery and the police called an ambulance.
When the paramedics arrived they rushed into the store with dark fears having
seen other results of conveiance store robberies and went to the police who
were bent around a figure lying on the floor wearing the conveniance store
jacket. The police waved him away pointing to the felon and explaining that they
were just trying to get the attendants shirt off.

Hmm really don't seem to remeber the moral to the story but how about " A little
chain never hurts." :-)

Subject:  More Sca Stories

I remembered another Sca story, this was told to me by Wendela Gelhorn of East?
When we were discussing Scadian legends.

      There was once a fighter in the east? whom through lack of funds to pay
forall his armour was forced to take employment as an attendant at a local
conveniance store (read stop and rob). One evening while mopping the the floor
a rather seedy looking sort of charecter walked in and produced a knife.
Pointing it at the attendant he ordered him to open the cash drawer. Well the
attendant proceeded to smile. When the villean saw this he be came enraged,
asking the attendent if he was crazy, did he not see that he (the villan) had a
knife, and didn't he (the attendent) know that he (the villan) could kill him.
The attendent smiled even broader and invited him to try. When the villan rushed
the attendent he suddenly found a mop thrust forcefully into his face, forcing
him to take an unexpected seat on the ground. When the villan got up he saw the
attendent still standing where he was calmly holding his mop with a very broad
grin on his face. Now the villan was not a complete fool he did not rush the
attendant again but instead attempted to stealthily close with him. But every
time he tried to get closer he found that devastating mop forcing him back. The
villan was persitant but he found that he was slowly losing ground and being
forced back, feeling discrection was the better part of valor he turned and beat
a hasty retreat. The attendant took down his license plate number and was able
to give the police a very good description so that later the villan was
arrested and convicted of attempted robbery.
   Oh and the attendant? Well he wento on to win the coronet list in that
kingdom, his favored weapon... polearm.

Message-Id: <4856@dasys1.UUCP>

In the high and far off times, in the great days of the real Cloisters
Festival (that was when a thriving NY mediaevalist community was developing
its centers and seasonal feasts), the Anachronist contingent would pack up
at the end of the day and make a mass descent on Chinatown. In later years,
we were overwhelmed by greenhorn whippersnappers who showed no respect for
tradition....
   Anyway, on the particular occasion in question it was a cohesive group which
arrived, and I got to lead the column down Pell St., shouting "Make way for
the King!" When a large group declined to wait out the lines at the legendary
Wo Hop's, we fetched up at the Peking Tung Lai Shun instead. The party did
not quite manage to take up three tables, and two mundanes were placed in the
remaining seats at one of them. Awestruck they gazed at these weirdly-dressed
people surrounding them. Dumbfounded they watch as They proceeded to drink
to "The King!!!" Shocked they looked on as everyone else proceeded to pull
out all manner of short weaponry to eat with. So did the waiter, who vanished
into the kitchen. A few minutes later, he emerged with two huge steel carving
knives and presented them to the mundanes. "Now everybody even!" he announced.

Subject: A couple of comments

I just got the last five issues of the digest; the following comments are
based on all of them.

Magnus de Cnoc an Iora commented (in #12) that one of the things that is in
the way of the Registry updating to a more modern system is the rather old
machine currently in their possession. According to the last Minutes of the
BoD, this is being worked on; they are hoping to upgrade to a *real* machine
(a 386-based something) Real Soon Now. This should help.

Lord Dagonell's article about a point-based system for the Crown was
fascinating; I'm not sure that it would work, but it's one of the better-
thought-out proposals I've heard. The only problem that I can find in it is
that it would discriminate in favor of those gentles who are in greater
population densities. I mean, here in Carolingia, there is an average of
one event every month-and-a-half, and there is one within a couple of hours
virtually every week. Those living in, say, the Northern Canadian groups
would have to do a *lot* of travelling to go to the same number of events
that I could go to easily. (And much though I'd love to be King, I'd like 
everyone to have similar opportunities :-) On the flip side, though, anyone
who can't get to events frequently easily is going to have some problems
as King, so I'm not *sure* that this is a legitimate gripe.

Lastly, Chaluim Dearg asked what Knightriders is. It's a *very* good movie,
which came out about five (?) years ago and sank like a stone. It is
available on videotape, but is pretty hard to find. Send me some mail
if you want more details -- I love to talk about this flick.

Greetings!

First of all, you would probably be interested in knowing that a few
years back, TI published an issue concentrating on Japan and Japanese
persona.   I'm not sure which issue it was (Siobhan?), but it was very
well done.  

Japan had its own rather sophisticated system of heraldry.  Japanese
devices are called "mon".  Mon developed along very similar lines to
Western European arms.  The insignia were hereditary, and were originally
used for identification on the field of battle.  Of course, they used
different kinds of designs, but they are philosophically very similar.
Originally (12th century, I think), mon were very simple, generally
consisting of single charges, and were almost exclusively used as
military insignia.  As Japanese medieval culture developed, mon became
closely tied to feudal rank and to political stature.  Most mon are
radially symettric, and use floral patterns. Many appear within a
circular frame.  However, there are many different types of designs
which were used, and styles varied over time.  A good source for mon
design is "Japanese Design Motifs", available at many large book
stores.  If you are interested, let me know & I'll give you the publisher
and so on.  A second important point about  mon design is that colors
were not specified.  Mon were designed with dark charges on a light
background, or light charges on a dark background.  The actual colors
used depended on the circumstances.  For example, if you have a
dark-on-light mon, and you are making a pale red kimono, you would
stamp the mon in a darker red.

The SCA College of Arms recognizes that mon are a legitimate form of
heraldry, and encourages those with Japanese persona to register
properly designed mon.  In keeping with period practice, we only
register mon in black and white.  Mon must meet the same standards of
difference as European-style armory, and must be clearly blazonable in
standard terms.  Of course, they may (and should) use Japanese design
elements.   

A note on Japanese names: the construction of Japanese names is a
tricky thing, and one which I do not fully understand.  In the SCA,
Japanese names are expected to be of the form <family name> <personal
name>, without any honorific elements.  The best way to choose each
name is from history books, lists of period names, and the like.  If
you need some specific sources, I will be glad to suggest some.  There
is a Japanese expert in the College of Arms, Monsho Herald.  If you
would like to contact him, I will send you his address.

     About a year ago the same thing bugged me until I thought about it a
little more closely. We were experiencing the usual misconceptions about
fealty and what an oath of fealty ment. Master Gerhard Von Nordflammen had
already written the first "In Defense of Feudalism" article, I was moved to
embellish upon it. This originally appeared in an issue of the MARK, the 
Barony of Westermark's newsletter and I hope it in part answers Lord Harald's 
question about what the Dream is.

Editorial - IN DEFENSE OF FEUDALISM - Part II
-----------------------------------------------

     I live in the twentieth century, a technological wonderworld where a 
man can travel faster than the speed of sound, escape the gravity of earth,
travel to other worlds. A place where I can use machines to cook, create
entertainment, adjust my environment, even think for me. A world which one
hundred years ago was as fictional as any you or I could read about in any
one of a hundred 'recreational' publications today.

     Yet I choose of my own free will to belong to a Society which harkens us 
back to the days of yore, when armour clad knights rode in defense of their
Lord's lands, where a man's word was more binding than any lawyer's 
contractual agreement, where ballads were sung about heroic deeds more awe 
inspiring than an evening of 'Miami Vice' or 'Dallas' on the one eyed monster.

     Perhaps the strangest part of all this is I'm not alone. This is a world
wide fraternity with thousands of members. We share a collective "Dream", a 
dream of the Middle Ages as we would like to see it. Sure it has some elements
of fantasy involved, the Middle Ages was a horrible place to live. But there's
something about the idea of stepping out of this century and into another one 
which appeals to us. It appeals to us so much that we've developed some pretty
sophisticated rules and regulations to insure we stay within some sort of 
boundary, a framework if you will, so that the illusion of the Middle Ages 
remains as much as possible. We understand this and are willing to work within
those guidelines so that the illusion is maintained for all of us.

    But what happens when these guidelines, these rules, disturb the illusion?

    For the most part, the rules and regulations within the Society are mostly
good, common sense rules. They are the kinds of things which help us maintain 
a level of safety, promote good relations with our neighbors, help maintain 
the illusion of the Middle Ages. Since not everyone's "Dream" is the same, 
they bind those of us together who would fragment due to minor differences of
aesthetics. Every time we get a new King, we get some new rules, every time 
the Board of Directors meets, we get a few new rules, and so on until those 
areas which were potential hazard areas are fine tuned for the benefit of all.

    No society which imposes regulations upon it's members is perfect. Usually
there is a small minority who opposes some facet of the organization because
he/she feels that it doesn't meet with their approval. Sometimes the rules 
themselves are just plain bad rules. They favor a faction or support a 
minority viewpoint to the deteriment of all. Sometimes they become political 
footballs, pushed across the field in some ritualistic contest of wills to 
prove the superior point of view. When this happens it's to the sorrow of the 
society which supports such activities. Laws or rules which trample over the 
bodies of people to support favoritism or breed elitism for whatever reason in
whatever form, should be discouraged. 

     In medieval times, the King's word was law. From the Crown the law spread
downward through the social register, each level of nobility bearing a 
responsibility to the level above and below it. Even the Crown was not exempt,
for if the peasants became to discontent they could always rise up in revolt
and overthrow their oppressors. The ruling class had to balance their 
interests and the peasants needs carefully, lest they find themselves locked 
in their own dungeons or impailed upon their own gatespikes.

     In the Society the King's word is law. From the Crown comes the changes 
in the law, which hopefully enrich the Society and help strengthen and 
maintain the illusion. During the Coronation procedure the King and his Queen 
swear to the populous of the Kingdom that they will defend and support the 
Kingdom until such times as they depart from their thrones, death take them, 
or the world end. The Nobles and Great Officers of the land come forward and 
swear fealty to the Crown, the Crown swears fealty to them, and so on down the
line. Thus is the reciprocal nature of the Society fealty, King to noble, 
noble to vassal, just as it was eons ago. Thus a part of the Dream we believe 
in, lives.

     Most of us will never kneel before the Crown to swear fealty, we instead 
look to the rest of the Nobility and Chivalry, we swear to the Knight or 
Baron, (or in the certain cases Prince or Princess, or Crown appointed 
authority) in order to fulfill our obligation. Just as in medieval times, 
nobility takes on an important role, from the lowliest Knight to the Great 
Dukes of the Realm. For in swearing fealty to them, we swear fealty to the 
Crown itself. When they then kneel before the Crown it's as if we knelt before
the Crown, we have "pledged by proxy" our support and our loyalty. Such is the
nature of the beast.

     But there exists a problem in the Society which the real medievalists had
a solution for. What do you do when a ruler abuses the power granted? In the
Society we have no way to "rise in revolt" if the ruler abuses the authority 
and trust we have placed in him. Further, if we disapprove of the Crown's 
action and are so bold as to speak out, we are reminded that the "King's word 
is law," which is tantamount to insisting that we remain silent lest we be 
found "guilty" of breaking the oath of fealty which we swore to the Crown.

     Yet, didn't the King swear the same oath to us?

     In most matters, the King, whoever he may be, usually makes good, sound 
decisions which help rather than hinder the development of the Society. Yet
we have also seen our share of "bad" decisions, those laws, edicts, and
appointments to offices or stations which have caused major factional splits, 
those which have fragmented the solidarity of the Dream, those which have 
caused dissension in the ranks. Fealty is important to all stations in a 
medieval environment, and no matter who the King of our Society is, it is
best for all concerned that the King remembers that he is responsible to the 
people in the same way the people are responsible to the Crown. The duty of 
the King therefore, as the flame of fealty illuminates it, becomes crystal 
clear. He is the Defender of the Dream first, Defender of the Land second, 
defender of special interests.....never! He must strive to work for the good 
of the Kingdom and the people in it or else he fails in his oath to his 
subjects, in his oath to the Crown.

     The Crown of any Kingdom is the symbol of the trust which the subjects
of the Kingdom place in the King who wears it. It is the emblem which squarely
rests the authority and responsibility of the Kingdom and it's subjects
directly upon one person's shoulders. It is also the symbol of love that the 
people have in their Kingdom, in their Society, in their King. It is why it's 
weight is so great, for it bears the load of the decisions made under it, now 
and forever more. Kings may come and go but the Crown is forever.

     I do not envy the rulers who wear those Crowns, for theirs is a world 
filled with decisions which must be tempered by their judgement and wisdom so
that the Dream lives on in all. I sympathize with their plight, balancing the 
needs and desires of their subjects so that all will be pleased with their 
decisions. Therefore I support them when I can and when I am able. Part of 
that support is to gently remind them of their obligations to their subjects 
when I perceive that those obligations overlooked. I would be remiss in my 
oath to my Kingdom if I didn't.

     Though the responsibility of the Kingdom lies on their shoulders, though 
the ultimate decisions for the welfare of the Kingdom must rest with them, it
is these decisions which add or subtract to the collective might of the Dream 
as perceived by their subjects. They either add to it's strength, creating a 
solid illusion which everyone believes or tear away at it bit by bit until the
mundane framework begins to show through. We as the Crown's subjects must do 
play our parts as well, including the offering of council or constructive 
criticism when needed. This doesn't mean that the Crown should change it's
opinions or decisions to meet with our criteria,(for who is to say that one
version of the Dream has any more validity than any other?), but to simply 
listen to the opinions provided, from whatever quarter they might arise.

     The Society for Creative Anachronism should be large enough to encompass 
everyone's dreams about what the Middle Ages should be like, both fantastic
and realistic. In the areas where overlap is involved, the Crown should weigh 
all factors involved, take all council offered. It is the responsibility that 
the Crown undertook when they swore their oath. It is the foundation of 
feudalism. It is the Dream of which we speak, a blending of everyone's idea
of the SCA.

     If I didn't love my Kingdom I would remain silent. But my oath of fealty 
causes me to speak thusly. For by swearing fealty through my Knight and my 
Baron I too have taken an obligation to defend my Kingdom, to help support the
collective illusion known as the Dream. To do less would be to break this 
oath, an oath I have with myself, my peers, and my King.

In Service to the West Kingdom,

Lord Arron Renyard

Subject: checking memberships

    Actually, the Midrealm Seneschal checks the membership requirements of all
    the entrents as they sign in at the list table.  A good idea, in general,
    to avoid problems such as recently happened 8-(.

They check out here in the East, too.  However, checking that one IS a member
at the time of Crown Tourney appears to not be sufficient.  Lucan *WAS* a
member the day he won Crown.  He firmly believed he had sent his renewal in -
but he screwed up.

   A number of comments about knighthoods for unassociated
   fighters:  but first a disclaimer:  
   
      I do not wish to insult anyone's intelligence.  What I have
      to say may seem obvious.  It is.  I just feel that we may
      be overlooking some of these points _because of_ their
      obviousness.
       
      
    1) Of course belts are generally given to squires:  we expect
       this, in general.  The reasons are, again, obvious:
       fighting households choose members, and knights choose
       squires, largely on the basis of their interest in
       fighting: i.e. the likelihood that they will stick
       with it long enough to acquire some skill.  They also
       tend to give a lot of "extra" encouragement and assistance
       to their novices.  That is exactly the point of being
       a squire in the first place.
       
    2) Some abuse of the rights of non-squired novices has
       been described.  My personal impression is that although
       I'm sure it is the case, it also seems to be a rare
       exception to the rule of general well-meaning
       encouragement to all.  
       
       My experience is that there is less "personal" politics
       among fighters than exists in the rest of the Society.
       Yes, this is probably because fighters take the the SCA a
       little less seriously; perhaps that is exactly the point.
       Regardless, I consider it a mark in favor of fighters (and
       "even" stick jocks). 
                           
  
  Final disclaimer:  Views expressed herein are my own and not to
              the best of my knowledge shared with anyone at all.

I believe that the time delay between check receipt and 'official' membership
is  a farce. I should be a 'member' from the time my check is received. As a 
'member' I am owed 12 issues of my kingdom newsletter. So what if after a year
I decide not to remain a member but still receive next months newsletter? It 
doesn't hurt anyone if I do. This artificial delay does hurt people and 
should be abolished.

The Barony of Windmasters Hill has won Giants Dance for the second year
in a row.  This is only the second year that Giants Dance has been run and
it looks as if it will become a MAJOR event.  People were saying that the
fighting this year was some of the hardest they have ever seen.  The biggest
problem was the weather.  Leave it to the Barony of Sacred Stone to have
a winter event in the middle of June!  Sweltering heat to fight in and
then you have to scrape the ice off your tent the next morning.  Lord
Eldred Tremane has been invested as the new Baron of Windmasters Hill.
 
An side issue:  What do people think of the Atlantian combat arrows?  I
undersand the need for safety, but golf tube arrows sort of loose something.

Subj:	Re: midrealm crown tourney

SInce my lord competed in the Midrealm crown, I know for a fact
that Mistress Myrra checked all the memberships of the unbelted
fighters and prospective consorts when (then) His Highness
submitted his list of unbelted invitees, and checked the
memberships of the Chivalry who reserved when they sent their
letters in (two weeks in advance). This enabled her to contact
folks who were expired and let them gracefully withdraw early,
rather than being turned down at the list table., Some Chivals
who were affected this way were Count Fuyuzuru, Sir Dag, and one
or two others.
 
Memberships are handled in this way:
 
Checks are received and journalized in the first twenty days of
the month. The last ten days of the month are reserved for
late-arriving checks, and for finalizing data-entry of the new
and renewed memberships. Sometime between the 25th and the first
of the next month the database is updated and the new memberships
are "run". This creates a list of folks whose memberships will be
current as of the first of the NEXT month. For example:
 
My membership expires Nov. 1 of 1988. I should send a check to
the Registry by September 15th. That check will be journalized,
my entry in the database will be updated, and my name will appear
on the list which is printed October first. This list contains
the names of people who have valid memberships as of Nov. 1. If I
do not send my check 6 weeks in advance, my membership will
lapse. The reason for this lag time is the need to print
newsletter labels in advance.
 
The mailing labels for each month are run between the 5th and the
10th of the month PRECEEDING the cover date of the newsletter.
They are mailed priority mail to the CHroniclers so they arrive
about the 15th: Chroniclers must mail their newsletters on or
before the 20th of the month Preceeding the cover date.
 
Does this help?

As moderator of sca_digest & sca@mc I find your letter of 3_June_88 
distressing.  None of the letters posted in digests 1-13 have mentioned
any one fencer by name, any group of fencers, or directed any criticism
to the marshalate structure.  

Flaming is not tolerated in this newsgroup, digest, and redistribution list.
We *ARE* honorable people.  If you feel that personal attacks have been made,
would you please forward direct evidence of those attacks, and as moderator,
I will investigate your claims.

PLEASE recognize that any organization within the SCA, any of its officers, or
any other member of the society which is in the society's view may be discussed
in public.  This is the laws of the United States as they pertain to the rights
of privacy of an individual.  I will try to ensure that these rules are adhered
to.  To date, they have.  

Under the aforementioned statutes, the Kingdom Marshalate, its leading marshals,
and the Dons may be discussed and criticized. One may not make libelous 
statements about these individuals.  I recommend you to the AP Handbook for 
further discussions of libel.  Under the rules of honor and flaming, one may
not make personal attacks at an individual.  

Have you seen personal attacks at individuals?   If you have, please, please
refer me to those messages.

As to the attendance of meetings.  The meetings I have attended, while never
publicized, where always well attended.  As to letters sent, I have sent many,
and these represented the opinions of many of my students.  Never once did I
receive a written response to these letters. I might ask, who complained about:
"not being able to feed into the rules"?  I will leave the matter of "is this
true of not" to the overall opinion of the EK fencing population.

Yours in Service,

Greetings, good gentles!

	[Coronation preparations having settled down long enough for me to read
here again...]

	Along the lines of encouraging the non-fighters to participate at 
tournaments, the May Day Tournament here with the Voyagers has one traditional
contest which is very fun _and_ in period: Body Looting.
	The fighters who wish to participate walk into the eric, spread out, and
practice their death scenes one more time. Then, with all the bodies ready, the
signal is given, and the looters swarm out to the field of battle. The signal to
end is given when no more noticeable activity is seen on the field. The scores
are tallied for each individual or team, and the winner/winning team is awarded
an appropriate prize. Scoring: armor piece 1 point, helmet 5 points, cup 10 points
(no, NOT drinking cup!). Other items are normally negotiable, such as jock strap
3 points, cloth items 1 point. Historical notes on body looting: at May Day, it's
been getting more fun-filled every year- Yaroslav the Persistent got pantsed, and
it took 15 minutes to collect all of his gear [and ransom his pants]. The tradition
is set for the winners, though, since the jock strap that the team Caravan was a 
negotiable item this year. Team Caravan was winner 1988, and Zantina (my lady
sister) was winner 1987, both with a winning score of 69.
	Gee, doesn't tradition just get so inspiring sometimes? :-)

If the deputy Earl Marshalls receive a complaint about a member of the
marshallate or if I get one it will be investigated.  If an authorized fighter
consistently does not play by the rules that fighter will have his/her 
authorization pulled.   Basically we can't
afford any problems now, with the problems people are having with liability
insurance (the barony I practice lost its ten-year-old practice site due to
an accident in a Dagorhir group using the same park (Cleftlands).

I can also tell you that the Chivalry of the Middle watch each other quite
carefully, giving suggestions and criticisms quite freely.  Everyone eventually
makes a mistake; the problem is to keep it from becoming a habit.

There are a few sources; most of them are in either the Folger or the
Huntingdon Libraries.  The Book of the Sword (newer edition) has a list of
"period sources" but misses some major ones, for example a 15th century
manuscript that was used for backgrounds in catalog for the Tower of London
Exhibit here in the U.S.  Late 16th century tournaments are documented
in the woodcuts that decorate one of the late Elizabethan books on 
the code of honor (they show two people in three-quarter harnesses with
burgonets and two weapoons, one a long armor-smasher and the second a
shorter parrying dagger (still 2 feet or so long.)

The estoc was the arming sword of the earlier period, and it was basically a
long metal punch.  The Italians like war hammers, which were basically also
sheet metal punches on one side and hammers on the other.  The halberd was
useful as a can opener; local experiments with the Middle Kingdom's halberds
(conducted by the makers) showed that even light blows would split heavy sheet
metal.  Armor was basically ended by the gun, not the rapier; descriptions of
16th century tournaments (including some on foot) suggest that good armor
was not easy to punch.  There is a so-so book called "Old Sword Days and
Old Sword Ways" that has a little information on this, but with no sources.

I would be very interested.  I have some things to share; I took extensive
films of some of the Midreal Crowns a while back and did some work with
a light box that allowed me to draw some of the better fighters as stick
figures.  I learned, for example, that one of our masters could only hit
when both feet were planted (he uses hip motion to propell the blow); 
a Duke clearly telegraphs a shot when he's tired by dropping the tip 1/2"
or so; etc., etc.  These people have undoubtedly changed since then, but
the films are interesting.  I also republished George Silver's "Brief
Instructions on My Paradoxes of Defence", an Elizabethan (1595) text
on fighting with the sword, bastard sword, great sword, pole weapon,
etc.  Silver clearly describes something that is similar to both saber
and SCA fighting.  

There is also a 15th century poem on fighting with the two-hand sword;
it turns out to be a series of offensive and defensive katas.

Good Gentles,

I have recently relocated to the Chicago area (Naperville) and am looking

the Kingdom contact as the phone number in my most recent TI was wrong :-(
I am also seeking sources of period wind instrumentation (Shawms!) in the

  Many thanks in advance,

Over the last few weeks a great deal of SCA news has come across this net.
Having a national communications net is a wonderful way of getting news out,
stories shared, and knowledge distributed. Unfortunately, something not so
wonderful is happening. The knives are going in deep and personal attacks
are being made. We are forgetting the main idea of the society,
HONOR. There will always be politics and problems, but making attacks on 
people not plugged into the net and unable to defend themselves is hardly
worthy of a group pledged to honor. 

Lately, there have been some complaints about fencing in the East Kingdom,
and some of the Kingdom's fencing rules. We are not saying they are perfect,
but we are having trouble getting most of the marshalls to respond to letters
or come to meetings at events. If you have a beef with "an un-named and un-local
but highly placed marshall", and if your facts are correct, confront this 
person face to face in an honorable way, not behind his back on a national net.

As for complaints about not being able to feed into the rules, and the
allegation that only a small group is controlling them, why have there
never been responses to the letters that have been sent to the marshalls
asking for your input to controversial rule changes? Why are the marshalls
not polling their local fencers then bringing those responses to the
marshall meetings called at events (at least send them in). The letters
started going out because there has not been great attendance at the meetings,
so the thought was send out questions and get responses. What else can be done?
Every marshall gets a copy of the rules after changes, and letters before the
changes from those wanting input. The communication paths have been open, use
them. We have had people interested in starting a kingdom fencing newsletter
to share event ideas and fencing tips, but due to non-response from the
marshallate letters sent, figure why try?

We are sorry to air our bad linen on the net, but some folks in the East
seem to forget that this small population they are complaining about got
fencing recongnized in the East. It wasn't easy, but finally there is a
structure and set of rules that were acceptable to the crown and BoD, we
have to start somewhere. Some minor points like titles and that have yet
to be ironed out, but at least we are FENCING! Instead of poking flames
at people who do not have access to the net, we should be helping to tweak
and hone this infant system. Most of all, FENCE AND HAVE FUN, that's what
it is really all about (isn't it?).

For anyone out there interested in a set of our rules and order the June
Pikestaff tells you how to get them (sorry they are not in ascii form for
email). We in the East also have great ides for fencing events and tournaments.
I don't know about you folks but some of the role playing tourneys have been
a blast! Let's share some of the good with the bad, OK?

Subject: on restructuring the Registrar's office

I recently had a bit of a discussion about the Registrar's Office with a
well-informed source.  I think there is a general perception that the office
is not being well handled, even among the powers that be, but since there
exists (as far as I know) no written statement about what the office *does*
it is hard to judge.  So please understand that the suggestions I am about
to make may be founded on inadequate information.  If anyone out there can
send me a formal statement of the duties of the Registrar's office, please
do so!

One problem with the office is that membership records are kept using a
home-brewed and apparently suboptimal piece of Cobol code.  For example,
one restriction of the code is that it cannot produce lists of memberships
that must invariably expire.  If a person has not submitted a check by a
certain day in a given month, there is no question that that person's
membership will expire and not be renewed at the end of the month.  If a
list of such people could be generated, it could have (for example) prevented
the bit of unhappiness with Lucan's brief tenure as Prince of the East.
As a programmer it seems pretty trivial to me to extract such a list, but
it is (as I understand it) beyond the capabilities of the current code.

The obvious solution to this is to replace the code with any of a number
of off-the shelf databases.  There are some hindrances to this, however.
The computer on which this stuff runs is neither terribly new nor terribly
popular, so it would probably have to be replaced at a cost of perhaps
$5000.  Also I get the impression that the project has not met with resounding
support from the Registrar, whose husband wrote and maintains the current
code.

Another problem is that membership is currently inexorably linked to getting
a newsletter.  A person is by definition a member the first month their
newsletter arrives.  This introduces delays which are, in my opinion,
unnecessary.  A more natural solution would be for the Registrar to immediately
note the membership of a new member, and then forward his or her newsletter
requests to the appropriate chronicler(s) for processing.  Let the chroniclers
maintain their own subscription lists;  that way non-members can subscribe
to newsletters too.  I believe this is the way the publications of other
organizations I belong to (admittedly larger than the SCA) are handled.

I agree that the Registrar's office could be decentralized.  I don't think
the idea of having local exchequers process membership forms is desirable.
They are a scurvey bunch;  I've been one for a number of years so I know.
However, it seems simple enough to me to create a Kingdom office to handle
new memberships.  That officer could enter the new names and other data
into a computer of his or her own, print up the membership cards and mail
them out, and (say monthly) download the new names to the corporate office.
If we assume 1900 payed members in the Kingdom (true of the East, the largest
kingdom), that comes out to about 37 renewals per week.  This seems pretty
manageable.  

Of course, I can't comment on the Registrar's other duties because I don't
know what they are, but I suspect that memberships are a large part of the
job and the whole office would run more smoothly if they were straightened
out.

Gentles, with all of the discussion currently on the net about "Cabbages and
Kings", I thought I'd post an article I recently wrote for AESTEL, the newletter
for the Western Region of the East Kingdom.  Feel free to comment.
 
 
		       AN ALTERNATIVE TO CROWN TOURNAMENTS
		  by Lord Dagonell Collingwood of Emerald Lake
 
Every once in a while at a post-rev, I hear somebody say that the SCA puts
too much emphasis on sword-fighting and not enough on the other things that
we do.  This usually leads into a discussion of Crown and Coronet Tourneys and 
other possible methods of choosing a ruler.
 
I'd like to offer one possible method that I worked out strictly as an
intellectual excercise.  I am NOT starting a campaign to change the way we
elect our sovreigns for either the kingdom or the incipient principality.  
I offer it only as a topic for discussion.
 
There are basically four categories of activities in the SCA; sword-fighting,
archery, fencing and a catch-all called arts and sciences.  I am not putting
down arts and sciences, my lady and I are co-MOAS for our barony.  I am simply
stating that A&S covers a wide variety of activities.
 
There are also three levels of activities; barony, region and kingdom.  I
realize that other levels exist i.e. canton, shire, province, dominion,
principality, etc. but my example only concerns itself with the three listed.
It could easily be expanded to include these others as separate or equivalent
levels.
 
Anyone who wins *any* competition at a barony level event receives one point.
Be it a fighting tourney, archery shoot or baronial bard contest, s/he gets
one point.  Winning first place at a regional level event is worth three
points.  Second place is worth one.  At a kingdom event, winning a 
competition earns five points; second place, three; and third place, one.
After six months, whomever has the highest point total is the new prince.
 
Advantages :
1.) You can eliminate any residency requirement because the competition
itself takes six months of *active* involvement.
 
2.) You can eliminate any previously-attended event requirement because
anyone who only attends a few events a year isn't going to win.
 
3.) The system favors the Renaissance type of individual.  A person who
does moderately well in several areas is more likely to win than someone
who is superior is just one field.  We would be very likely to get a ruler
who has at least a working knowledge of a number of areas of the SCA rather
than just expertise in fighting.
 
4.) It lessens the temptation to "rhino-hide".  The final round of a Crown
Tourney is winner-take-all.  The temptation to call a just-barely-acceptable
blow as "light" is enormous.  Under this new system, the difference between
first and second place in a tourney is only two points towards a cumulative
total.
 
5.) The bias against women is eliminated.  I know women are allowed to
enter Crown but they are at a physical disadvantage.  
 
	"Men have an average of 17 percent more muscle mass than women."1 
 
	"Female physiology dictates that the average woman is simply not 
	as fast on her feet as the average man. Witness the winners of 
	marathons.  Though the gap between men's and women's times has 
	been decreasing over the years, men still consistantly beat women.  
	The reasons for this are not mysterious.
 
	Women possess a large pelvis which is required in the process of
	reproduction, consequently, their strides are shorter and less 
	efficient than men's.  In addition, muscles and the brain rely on 
 	oxygen to perform at peak levels.  Because men generally have larger 
	hearts, their hearts pump more oxygen carrying hemoglobin per beat 
	than do women's hearts.  Obviously, the more oxygen the muscles and 
	brain receive, the more energy they can produce."2
 
6.) The system has been tried and proven workable.  The U. S. Chess Federation
runs a year long competition each year on a similiar system.3  The American
Junior Golf Association and Golf magazine select each year's Junior All
American Golf Team this way as well.4
 
Disadvantages :
1.) It would require changing the current laws regarding Crown and Coronet
Tourneys to adopt this system.
 
2.) It would mean more paperwork but not as much as would seem at first glance.
All of the activities listed, sword-fighting, archery, fencing and arts &
sciences, have baronial level officers who report to kingdom superiors.  In
the worst case, you'd have to create a minor Kingdom officer whose job it
would be to co-ordinate the reports and keep track of everyone's score.
 
3.) We've been using the old system for over twenty years.  People would be
mistrustful of a new system simply because it is a new system.  If the old
method has worked for twenty years, why bother to change it?  Changing the
system would require a huge amount of effort.  And some people would be
against it.
 
4.) There would be less suspence and anticipation.  The morning of Crown
Tourney, no one knows who's going to be the next King.  Under the point
system, it might be well known if someone has a commanding lead, which might
discourage other competitors.  One possible solution might be to keep the
point totals a secret until the winner is announced in court.  The archery
points at Pennsic are handled this way.  You get rumours and speculation,
but nobody is quite sure.  Another possibility would be to have the COUPLE
with the highest point total become the next King and Queen.
 
5.) The Ice Dragon Festival doesn't fit anywhere in this system.  The 
rattan fighting and the fencing would probably count as baronial competitions, 
but how do you rate the Arts and Sciences Pentathlon?  Technically its a 
baronial competition because it takes place at a baronial level event.  But the
scores are reported to the East Kingdom Arts and Sciences Office, so is it 
baronial or kingdom level?  One competition or two?  And then there's the 
structure of the Pent itself.  It's 1 pentathlon with 12 categories and 47 
sub-categories.  Do you count it as 1 competition? 12? 47?
 
Things That Stay the Same :
1.) Surprise!!  We still have a Crown Tournament.  Its one last chance to
win just a few more points before the new Crown Prince and Princess are 
announced at dinner that evening.  What's changed is that its not a do-or-die 
proposition anymore.  You can lose the tournament and still be declared 
the next Prince/ss.
 
2.) Letters of Intent are still required.  Someone may just like entering
( and winning! ) competitions and not be interested in the throne.  The other
rules about suitable consort, etc. would still apply as well.
 
Finally, I would like to remind everyone once again, that I developed this
system strictly as an intellectual excercise and I offer it only as a post-revel
discussion topic.  I am NOT interested in trying to change the system.  I 
welcome all correspondance and my mailing address is : Lord Dagonell Collingwood

Subject: Mead making
Message-Id: <8806030117.AA00333@davids.UUCP>

Greetings,

A gentle recently inquired as to a recipe for making mead.  I am
yet but an egg at this game of making mead, but do have a small
amount of knowledge in such matters.  It also happens that I am
a bit of a pack rat when it comes to knowledge and while rummaging
around the insides of my home computer found some postings which
I'd saved on the subject.

First the recipe which I've been using so far.  It's really pretty 
simple ... A quart of honey to a gallon of water.  Then add in
a little bit (1/4 tsp) of tannin and acids (3 tsp of malic acid,
and 1 1/2 tsp of tartaric acid).  Also some "energizer" which
is a yeast nutrient.  Finally you sterilize the mixture, which
means to either heat it to boil or near boil or to mix in some
chemicals which kills bacteria (campden tablet).  You let this 
sit a day then add the yeast to it, attach a fermentation lock,
and wait for the vigorous fermentation.  The last batch I started
started fermenting almost immediately...!

The recipe came from _Winemakers_Recipe_Handbook_ which was given
to me by the people at Semplex of U.S.A. (PO Box 11476, Minneapolis
MN 55411).  It works.  I've seen the same basic recipe in other
places including the Knowne World Handbook, a book which is sold
by Cariadoc, the _Making_Mead_ book which will be talked about
below, articles in TI, and so forth.

Anyway, the results of my pack-rat fetishes ...

Where to look for information on mead--these books are likely to be found
at your local beer/wine making supply shop; otherwise they can be ordered
from the American Homebrewers Association (AHA):

_Brewing_Mead_, Lt Col Robt Gayre and Charlie Papazian, 1986

_Making_Mead_, Bryan Acton and Peter Duncan, revised 1983

Gayre's section of the Gayre/Papazian book is most informative on the
history and traditions.  Gayre is somewhat of an authority; he was sought
out by the AHA for his expertise as they were trying to uncover knowledge
about meads.

If you want to know about making mead, FIND HOMEBREWERS!  There are lots of
homebrewing clubs--if you can't find one in your area, email a note back to
me and I'll find the info on the closest one.  There are mead categories
in AHA competitions.

What is mead?  It's a fermented beverage in which honey provides the sugars
for fermentation.  Some clarifications/corrections from other articles:

> The historical references aren't always clear...

and the matters have become somewhat worse because, as Gayre notes, mead
fell by the wayside some centuries ago as a cheaper (and not necessarily
better) substitute came along.

>...In one of my books, the author references
> a historical thing talking about a mead being served to some troops
> and the ingredients included Hops and ale yeast!  Yet usually Mead
> is thought of as a wine...
(and from another posting)
> Mead is honey beer, or honey wine. There is no real distinction between
> these two beverages except the amount of alcohol used,...

First, let's use narrow definitions of wine=fermented fruit (juice), beer=
fermented malt--then mead is neither.  If it doesn't have honey in it, it
isn't mead; if it has honey (as the main fermentable), it's either mead or
one of the variants (see below).  Alcoholic strength of mead is normally
stronger than beer; it may range from 10% alc vol up to wherever the yeast
give out (which is seldom over 15% vol).

Acton and Duncan explain the confusion mentioned:  The Anglo-Saxon word
"alu" (which sort of looks like "ale") really means mead; moreover, during
the Napoleonic wars, mead was made with a brewer's yeast, had hops added,
and was fermented to 4-6% alcohol--beer strength.  But it was still made
with honey.  Gayre also provides various historical bits.

> ...The weaker the mead, the sweeter it is...

No.  The normal procedures will either lead to (a) complete fermentation of
sugars or (b) as much fermentation as the yeast can handle, with some
residual sugar.  If you want a low-alcohol sweet mead, you have to take an
extra step to stop the yeast; this isn't as common so the sweet meads tend
to be the stronger ones.

Proper terms--although lots of homebrewers use "mead" for all sorts of
honey-based beverages (and not incorrectly so), the more precise terms are:
	mead = just fermented honey
	melomel = honey plus fruit juices
	pyment = honey plus grape juice (a "grape melomel")
	cyser = honey plus apple juice (an "apple melomel")
	metheglin = honey plus herbs
	hippocras = honey plus grape juice plus herbs (pyment flavored
		with herbs)
In the case of fruits, there is enough fruit or fruit juice added to make a
significant contribution to the alcohol.

If you want recipes and techniques, look at the books suggested in my
previous article--
	_Making_Mead_ by Acton and Duncan, or _Brewing_Mead_ by Gayre and
	Papazian
There is a brief treatment of mead in:
	_The_Complete_Joy_of_Homebrewing_, by Charlie Papazian, 1984 (be
	sure you get the recent version, 300+ pages with a color cover)
and it's a good book on procedures anyway.

> I currently have a batch of "Barkshack Ginger Mead" aging in my "mead cellar".
> The recipe is from Charles Papazan's (sp?) book,...

Techniques for making mead have been evolving pretty rapidly in the past
few years.  Charlie's "Barkshack" recipe has been around for quite a while;
it's a very beer-like recipe which gives a lower-alcohol, sparkling, dry
mead (with some melomel variations possible).  Homebrewers have also
thought of the obvious: add honey to beer.  I've had some excellent amber
and dark beers with a couple of pounds of honey in a 5-gal batch.

>...You can make mead by following the beer recipe I posted recently,
> substituting honey for malt, and using champagne yeast...

Although Charlie's Barkshack has hops in it, it's probably a better idea to
start making meads without hops.  It will be easier to figure out what
you're doing and how it matures...there is an astringent character from the
honey which changes over time, and the taste is easier to follow without
hops in the way.  (If you make mead at a reasonable strength, you won't
need hops to preserve it.)

Also, you need either fruit/fruit juice or some source of acid added to a
mead--something you wouldn't do with a beer--plus yeast nutrients (see
below).  You don't boil a mead the way you do beer wort.

As I've said, a lot of the interest in mead comes from homebrewers, so
we've started working with beer-like procedures and recipes, working
outward as we've figured out what works.

But Charlie is well beyond what shows up in either _Complete_Joy_ or
_Brewing_Mead_ (and I sort of wish he'd write about his meads some more!)
He made a sweet still mead which was served slightly warmed at a winter
party a couple years ago; I still haven't forgotten how good it was!  He's
done still and sparkling, with and without fruit, sweet and dry, and he's
gotten good results for most of the combinations.  But one of the keys to
his success is that he just keeps on making meads, so that they have time
to age.  For most meads, drinking them too young is a waste.  (If it has a
taste like Listerine(R), it's probably too young!  That's the result of
immature honey flavors.)

A few recent changes in meads:
	- Boiling the honey is not favored as in the past.  This is said to
	  damage the flavor of the honey (and my experience confirms this).
	  It can be heated and held just below boiling long enough to
	  sterilize it--but you DO need to sterilize most honey that is of
	  interest for mead.
	- Hops aren't as common.  We're getting away from beer style, and
	  frankly, people aren't making the mistakes that produce off-
	  flavors which require something to hide them.

An interesting effect:  I've had several blueberry meads--all excellent,
and all retaining some sweetness even though the initial gravity is low
enough that they should have fermented out.  It would seem that there's
some non-fermentable sugar in blueberries that doesn't exist in most other
fruits.  (I don't like that explanation--seems pretty unlikely.)

A leftover question:

Honey, in its natural state, tends to resist fungi and bacteria because of
the extremely high sugar concentrations.  It is also supposed to be
slightly bactericidal.  However, these properties are lost when the honey
is diluted to the strength appropriate to mead-making (which is why the
honey has to be sterilized).  The real problem is that honey is deficient
in certain nutrients needed by the yeast--they can grow for a while without
these nutrients, but not very well, and they won't complete the
fermentation properly.  You just use standard yeast nutrient; it should be
dissolved before adding to the mead, but need not be boiled.

Plain mead (without added fruit juices) is not sufficiently acidic, so it
also needs an addition there--some standard winemaking acid blend will
work.  (See the references for details.)

When using fruit or fruit juices (for melomels) you need to sterilize the
fruit but you should NOT boil it.  If you use whole fruit, boiling will
extract tannins from many fruits.  It will also extract and set pectin from
some fruits, enough that the mead will remain cloudy.

Reply-To: Wegeng.Henr@XEROX.COM

In the past few weeks several people have expressed interest in brewing mead.
Here are a couple references that I'm aware of:

	Title:	Brewing Mead/Wassail! In Mazers of Mead
	Authors:	Gayre & Papazian
	Publisher:	Brewers Publications
	ISBN:	0-937381-00-4

This is actually two books in one. The first part is a reprint of the book
"Wassail! In Mazers of Mead" by Lt. Colonet Robert Gayre, which is considered by
many to be the definitive history of the beverage mead. The second part is new,
called "Brewing Mead". This is a few short chapters on how to brew mead,
including some simple recipes.

Also, in the Winter 1987 issue of Zymurgy (vol. 10. no. 5) there is an article
titled "The Art of Making Mead" by Brother Adam. This is reprinted from his book
on beekeeping. The article is kinda technical, but very informative.

<swiftly ducking vegetables>

I thank Baron Alfgar for the writeup on period usage of titles.  This 
will be another neat bit in my file of interesting period information.

The original point, I believe, was missed.  Perhaps I worded that
sentence badly.  The idea I wanted to get across was that this
particular king wanted nothing to do with 'acting royal'.  He didn't
want to be bowed to, or called by any honorific 'greater' than Sir.
This person is very outspoken about having no persona and no particular
period.  IF he had wanted to revert to a medieval usage, there would
have been no objection whatsoever.  I also never meant to imply that 
he was barbaric.  Socialistic, yes.  I hope I have corrected any 
misunderstandings that may have arisen, and I apologize for taking up 
digest space dodging vegetables that I rather expected would be flung.

Over the last few weeks a great deal of SCA news has come across this net.
Having a national communications net is a wonderful way of getting news out,
stories shared, and knowledge distributed. Unfortunately, something not so
wonderful is happening. The knives are going in deep and personal attacks
are being made. We are forgetting the main idea of the society,
HONOR. There will always be politics and problems, but making attacks on 
people not plugged into the net and unable to defend themselves is hardly
worthy of a group pledged to honor. 

Lately, there have been some complaints about fencing in the East Kingdom,
and some of the Kingdom's fencing rules. We are not saying they are perfect,
but we are having trouble getting most of the marshalls to respond to letters
or come to meetings at events. If you have a beef with "an un-named and un-local
but highly placed marshall", and if your facts are correct, confront this 
person face to face in an honorable way, not behind his back on a national net.

As for complaints about not being able to feed into the rules, and the
allegation that only a small group is controlling them, why have there
never been responses to the letters that have been sent to the marshalls
asking for your input to controversial rule changes? Why are the marshalls
not polling their local fencers then bringing those responses to the
marshall meetings called at events (at least send them in). The letters
started going out because there has not been great attendance at the meetings,
so the thought was send out questions and get responses. What else can be done?
Every marshall gets a copy of the rules after changes, and letters before the
changes from those wanting input. The communication paths have been open, use
them. We have had people interested in starting a kingdom fencing newsletter
to share event ideas and fencing tips, but due to non-response from the
marshallate letters sent, figure why try?

We are sorry to air our bad linen on the net, but some folks in the East
seem to forget that this small population they are complaining about got
fencing recongnized in the East. It wasn't easy, but finally there is a
structure and set of rules that were acceptable to the crown and BoD, we
have to start somewhere. Some minor points like titles and that have yet
to be ironed out, but at least we are FENCING! Instead of poking flames
at people who do not have access to the net, we should be helping to tweak
and hone this infant system. Most of all, FENCE AND HAVE FUN, that's what
it is really all about (isn't it?).

For anyone out there interested in a set of our rules and order the June
Pikestaff tells you how to get them (sorry they are not in ascii form for
email). We in the East also have great ides for fencing events and tournaments.
I don't know about you folks but some of the role playing tourneys have been
a blast! Let's share some of the good with the bad, OK?

Gentles,

The May 1988 draft of the Society Publications Handbook is (finally)
available for anonymous ftp, for those of you to whom this is of use.

Connect to larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (42.2.4.3) and change into the sca
directory.  There are two files there; they are the same except that
one is a text file and the other has been compressed with the UNIX
`compress' utility (the .Z file is, of course, the compressed one).

	We sign the waivers for insurance purposes.  According the May West
Kingdom newsletter, we have insurance covers  to the tune of 5 million dollars
liability.  I assume that Canadian SCA would be covered as well, or at least
have some equivalent coverage.

	Sad.  But, I was almost this bad when I got started.  Then one day
I asked myself if I would still go to events if I couldn't fight.  When I
realized that the answer was "I don't know" I realized it was time to get 
involved in more things.  Now I stress participation in things other than
just fighting to the people that I train, and try to think up ways to get
non-fighters involved in tourneys as well as fighters.  I now try to at
least touch base with all the things going on as well.  It makes things
more interesting, a fine goal in an of itself.

	 I have seen unafilliated fighters get knighted, though it is a less
common occurance than seening a squire knighted.  You do need to be noticed to 
get knighted, so someone with a household that can travel and have people
mentioning his or her name is going to have an advantage over someone from
The Shire of No-place-you've-ever-heard-of.  But I don't really know how
we can avoid this. 
	The second part of this is, if not criminal, at least sickening.  There
is no reason to cause brusing other than inadequite armor, and certainly
those training new fighters should be the people who know better.  And if,
as you imply, this is done to keep them from regular practices then you 
have a problem that the local Knight's-Marshall should be interviening.
His job includes the safety of all the fighters in his teritory, not just
those who show up at the local practice.  


>Ideally, the Chivalry are the people to go to in order to *solve* problems
>like this. So what do you do when the Chivalry *are* the problem?

	See above.  If this officer is one of the problems... then about all 
that can be done is to talk to A) the local seneschal, or B) His or her boss.
Fighting, and the safety of the fighters, is the provence of the Marshallate,
of which the Chivalry is a part.  And the Marshallate answers to the Seneschal 
and the Crown.  Any suggestions Sir Allen?

Actually, the Midrelm Seneschal checks the membership requirements of
all the entrents as they sign in at the list table.  A good idea, in
general, to avoid problems such as recently happened 8-(.

I also think that the lag time between mailing out the check and getting
a renewal membership is far too long, but I don't have _any_ idea how
membership is handled (like how many memberships per month, how many

 There's a difference between coordinating inter-kingdom affairs
 and controlling them. Surely the Kingdoms would agree to honor
 ( at least some ) of their fellow kingdoms' awards, without the BoD's
 help ? Awards are presented by Kingdoms, why involve the BoD ?
 I think treaties about honoring titles would be great : any excuse
 for a war !! E.G. "How dare those snivelling mid-realmers not
 honor the titles of Duke Sir Splendid !! THIS MEANS WAR ! Break
 out the party hats !!"

 Inter-kingdom treaties about fighter-qualification,
 chiurgeon-qualification, rights-of-foreign-visitors,
 all these would be possible without the BoD.

 I don't think the Kingdoms should be separately incorporated,
 although they could be. I don't think every Kingdom should
 carry its own insurance, although they could. I think someone
 should publish TI. So I think there is a good reason to retain
 the BoD. But not as the all-powerful dictator it is now.

	Begging your pardon, but (not)knight .and. (not)peer != peasant.  
The SCA assumes that all members are of Gentle birth, no higher, no lower.
And an imbalanced representation is still imbalanced, regardless of what the
peasants want to read about...

We seem to have lost a lot of alt.sca items during feed problems here, and I no
longer have the digest the original message appeared in. But this is in re-
ply to the person who classed "not wanting to be called Your Majesty" as a
solecism ranking with wearing blue jeans in court.
  The truth is that "Majesty" as a style for kings is not mediaeval.
As EB (11th edition) relates:
  'The term "majesty" was strictly confined in the middle ages to the suc-
cessors of the Roman emperors in the West, and at the treaty of Cambrai 
(1529) it is reserved for the emperor Charles V."
Its adoption by kings dates from the 16th century, when they mystique
of THE Empire was wearing off, and every Tom, Sebastian and Harry started
claiming imperial status.
  In England, for instance, it was taken by Henry VIII, at the same time
that he declared England a "crown imperial" [contrary to popular fallacy, the
"Imperial State Crown" has nothing to do with the Indian Empire], and changed
his title from "Lord" to "King of Ireland". Previous kings had been
"Grace" or "Highness". Scotland never made the change during its independ-
ent existence. (In MONTROSE, Nigel Tranter has a hilarious scene where the
Duke of Hamilton, holding a Commissioner's audience, demands to be called
"Your Grace"; and to his consternation the Scots nobles decline to call him
by a style which they are accustomed to use only for the King, but announce
that they have no objection to calling him "Your Majesty", which has no such
unfortunate connotations.)
   So, if some King wants to revert to a _mediaeval_ usage, attacking him
for an alleged barbarism simply shows igorance; as did the ad demanding
that Corpora enshrine the Victorian "Prince Consort" in the name of "authenticity".

Sir Reynard and Mistress Brynhildr Kormaksdottor are the new Heirs to
the throne of the Midrealm.  I am positively certain that their
memberships are in order.  Some of you may recall Sir Reynard as the
fighter who was named Most Chivalrous in the Drachenwald tourney at the
last Pennsic.  The prize was a gorgeous amber necklace, which he
promptly presented to his lady.

I have been apprenticed to Mistress Brynhildr for about three years and

	The winner of the Crown Tourney for the Middle was Sir Reynard the 
Grey.  I fear I do not recall the name of the Lady he fought for (for which
I am *extremely* embarased).  The tourney had about 32 entrants and was 
(to my somewhat trained eye) well fought by all.  The tourney was well-hosted
by the March of the Crossing of the Red Spears (mka Toledo, OH).

	In other news of note, Sir Logos passed on the office of Earl-Marshall
to Sir Alan Culross, who happens to be on the net.  Also, the Queen's Guard
was renamed Eislinn's Guard in honor of the late Duchess Eislinn the Patient.

Subject: Reorganize Power within the SCA
Message-Id: <11043@steinmetz.ge.com>


  It seems here in the East matters have gotten a tad unpleasant.
  Things have been resolved, and I am not in the minority in
  praising the honor and nobility of our King and Queen, and
  the other principles in the affair. But enough on the past.
  This incident wasn't a problem in itself, so much as it is
  a SYMPTOM of a problem.

  It's time to decentralize power and responsibility in the SCA.

  The current system of obtaining membership is too slow. There
  is a better way.

  Why not allow the exchequer of any SCA group accept payment
  for and issue membership cards for the SCA ? Then the
  exchequer would send the new members names and their payment to
  the regional, principality or kingdom exchequer. Kingdom
  would extract that part of the payment needed for TI and
  BoD maintenance, and send it to the BoD, while keeping
  that part of the money associated with kingdom newsletters,
  and kingdom overhead. Kingdom would maintain a computerized
  list of members of the kingdom, and would periodically forward
  this list to the BoD and it's brother kingdoms.

  Exchequers would have spare copies of kingdom newsletters
  sent to them each month, which they would forward to new
  members not on the kingdom mailing list. This way, new members
  can immediately find out what's going on.

  I believe the fighter's registry is handled by kingdom ?
  If not it should be as well !

  The BoD still has a place in the SCA, as a handler of mundane
  affairs and a unifying influence between kingdoms, especially
  through its publication of Tournaments Illuminated.

  But the time has come for power to move closer to the people,
  and what better place than the persons and officers of our
  King and Queen ? I think most of the 1900 paid members of the
  East Kingdom probably agree with this.

	This is scary.  I fight in a 10 gauge helm that has yet to be dented.
But the blow described here isn't really denting 8 gauge.  The surounding
metal was still only 16 gauge, so the blow, while still too hard, wasn't 
quite as horrific as it sounds.  Even so, I'd hate to be on the recieving

Curiously enough, this debate follows closely the discussion in George Silver's
"Brief Instructions on my Paradoxes of Defense", an Elizabethan fighting manual.
Silver argues that the rapier-fight is of no use to the monarch in the wars and
therefore is mere conceit and vanity.  The only proper fight that a courtier
must learn is those that aid his/her King in the wars - which at least in the
Middle Kingdon rules out all but "heavy weapons".  (Silver wrote about 1595;
his manual jibes closely with many heavy weapon techniques.  Duke Master 
Moonwulf's "Florentine" is described exactly in Silver, who also gives the
counter-strategy :-) ).  

I've never done it, but I've heard that it's been done:  give me my three-
quarter harness and a bastard sword and I suspect that the only fight with
the rapier (of the 17th century variety or later) that would work would be
"Cobb's traverse".

Silver describes a battle between an unarmored Englishman with a two-hand
sword and an Italian with the rapier; the encounter was fatal to the Italian.

Silver's book is reprinted in "Three Elizabethan Fencing Manuals" by Scholar's
Press (? on the press).

As those of you who read the signature will note my interest in this area is
not just academic.  I actually have not made a decision on this issue for the
Middle Kingdom; that would require a wider consultation and much more
discussion and collection of information.  I am looking forward to talking
to some fencers at the War.

Good Gentle:

I agree wholeheartedly that the current BoD structure is unworkable,
inefficient, and frequently dictatorially unfair.  However, you must
consider the mundane necessities.  The SCA, Inc. is a non-profit
educational organization incorporated in the State of California.  The
IRS and similar external organizations are very touchy about what they
will let such a corporation do with its internal structure.  If we
want to retain our free-exempt status and if we want to maintain our
insurance policies, we have no choice but to have a strong & active
Board of Directors.  Many of your specific suggestions have great
merit, and I suggest you write the BoD and ask that they consider them
(not that that is likely to produce any results).  It is necessary for
the BoD to maintain some control over in-Kingdom affairs, such as
fighting standards and definitions of awards and titles...the
membership of the Society is too mobile to allow wild variations in
such standards: How would you feel if you moved 50 miles into the next
Kingdom and discovered that your noble rank of many years had ceased
to have any meaning?

Yes, at one time I was doing this regularly out of San Antonio.
I was first exposed to it in Atenveldt where in some places
(i.e. Phoenix) it is so big that they have shinai wars. Most of
what Michael says is true although hockey gloves can be
overkill. The idea behind this weapons form is that of 
'counting coup'. You want to land the blade on your opponent
rather than thru. I have comfortably fought in a fencing
mask, gloves, cup, and gambeson with no problems. Of course
this was with someone I trust!! Official rules also require
elbow and knee pads, no bare skin, and I believe gorget/coif.
I once took a full force blow across the ribs from someone
who had just come out of heavy weapons armor. All I was 
wearing was a light gambeson and all I got was a welt. The only
thing that I have ever had happen was when two new fighters got
a little cranked up (easy to do with such light weapons!!) and one
got hit on the elbow when his pad slid down. His elbow was
tender for a couple of days but that was it.
     This form imitates kitana and therefore assuming you are 
wearing silken robes at best makes for very little contact required.
Fighting shinai helped my great sword technique a lot although
you should always fight light first then fight heavy. It can be
very difficult to calibrate down.
     Anyone from the areas that does this a lot is welcome to
add, I have been having problems getting any acceptance for
this fighting style especially here where period fencing is so
popular.

Things have gotten kinda quiet here this past week. In order to do something
about this, let's try to get some story-swapping going. I suppose that it isn't
fair that I ask everyone else for anecdotes without providing some of my own. 
This one was re-told to me recently by Mussttapha, and his version is pretty 
close to mine, so I will guess that this is fairly close to something that 
actually happened.

			    "Vis and the Cliff"

Once upon a time, there was a young prince of the East Kingdom named
Vissevald (hereinafter referred to as "Vis", for ease of writing). And it
came to pass that Vis found himself a member of that elite force known as
The National Guard. And Vis (and his CO) found that he was pretty good at
this stuff. And such was the state of things.

One day, Vis' Guard unit found itself training in the same camp as a unit
of Green Beret recruits. The Green Berets, as such are wont to do, felt that
they were the finest fighting force in all the land. And so, one day, while
passing the time over a bottle of mead, Vis' CO bet the Berets' commander that
his men could attack and destroy the Berets' encampment. Bet a great deal of
money, at that. The Green Beret commander took the offer happily, for he was
certain that such a feat was not possible.

You must understand the lay of the land that the Berets were on. Their
encampment lay at the top of a steep cliff, jutting out into the ocean. There
was only one narrow path up to the encampment, and the Berets had that path
heavily guarded at all times. Since the cliff was tall, and almost vertical,
and their sentries were among the best, they reasoned that none could enter
the camp to destroy it. Here, they did not reckon with Vissevald.

Vis' CO, having made the bet, went back to Vis to tell him about it. Vis
was none too happy about having a plan that centered on him made without
his being consulted, but he eventually consented, on the grounds that he
get a cut of the money wagered. As the bet was for a substantial amount,
the CO agreed happily.

Part one of Vissevald's plan was surprise. The Guard unit would attack with
the dawn. Now, such units *never* wake that early, and Vis knew that the
Berets knew that. Thus, he hoped to take the Berets off-guard with an
early-morning mass attack. This was, of course, the distraction.

Part two was Vis himself. Early that morning, before cockscrow, he set out
to scale the steep cliff. Rubber knife clenched in his teeth, plastic hand
grenades strapped to his belt, he began to climb, foot by slow foot. His
reasoning was that the Berets would not have more than one guard at the
cliff; their entire defense was based upon the fact that the cliff was
unclimbable. He would reach the top of the cliff at the same time that his
distraction hit the front gate, sneak in, plant the granades, then leave.
Simple.

Thus, Vis reached the top of the cliff just as the dawn broke, only to
find the one thing that he hadn't expected: an alert sentry. As he pulled
himself over the top of the cliff, the sentry attacked, and a scuffle
ensued. Both Vis' rubber knife, and the sentry's fake gun were lost in the
struggle. As they separated for breath momentarily, they both began to cast
about for weapons, and each came upon a stout stick.

Vis smiled; after all, he was one of the finest fighters in the land, and
now, he was in his element. He swung a mighty blow --

-- and was blocked. Now puzzled, Vis fell into fighting posture, and began
trading blows with the man before him. Though Vis' blows were skilled and
quick, each was blocked by the mysterious sentry. Occasionally, he would
just slip a blow by, and was told, "Glance".

Finally, after a hard bout, Vis delivered a solid blow to the sentry, who
thought for a minute, then fell over. Vis came up to the man, but before
helping him to his feet, asked, "Where did you learn to fight like that?"

"Atenveldt...", said the sentry.

Vis pondered this for a moment, then said, "When you return to your home
land of Atenveldt, tell them of this battle. For there is no shame in being
defeated by the Crown Prince of the East!"

And so, the lone sentry defeated, Vis snuck into the camp, planted his
bombs, and won the bet. And from that day forward, he carried the certain
knowledge that you can meet allies in spirit in the *damnedest* places.

Ooh!  Ooh!  See here, "Poor Mundane", don't let the prevalence of fighters
scare you off the SCA.  The Society needs more like you and your wife.
As for camping, I would go ahead and take my standard large tent, but not 
pitch it directly adjacent to the eric (where the fighting goes on); later
on, you can build a nice big pavillion with little difficulty (mail me
privately and tell me your USnail address, and I'll send you some patterns).
As for your camping gear, here are a few hints: put a nice rug over your
ice chest; buy a few yards of decent-looking fake fur to cover your
sleeping bags.  Unfortunately, I can't think of any way to camouflage a
Coleman lantern that would still allow it to function; I prefer hurricane
oil lamps or alpinists' candle lanterns (neither strictly period, but still
look nice and have the right atmosphere); later on, you can make candle
lanterns out of perforated tin (if you're doing 1600's, that should be
close enough to your period for authenticity).

But the point of the Society (or so this optimist believes) is to have fun.
People should (and hopefully will) be patient with you as you get used to
the atmosphere.  They'll really appreciate the harping and (especially if
you're good) the piping (hint: don't pipe at 5am!).

his men could attack and destroy the Berets' encampment. Bet a great deal of
money, at that. The Green Beret commander took the offer happily, for he was
certain that such a feat was not possible.

You must understand the lay of the land that the Berets were on. Their
encampment lay at the top of a steep cliff, jutting out into the ocean. There
was only one narrow path up to the encampment, and the Berets had that path
heavily guarded at all times. Since the cliff was tall, and almost vertical,
and their sentries were among the best, they reasoned that none could enter
the camp to destroy it. Here, they did not reckon with Vissevald.

Vis' CO, having made the bet, went back to Vis to tell him about it. Vis
was none too happy about having a plan that centered on him made without
his being consulted, but he eventually consented, on the grounds that he
get a cut of the money wagered. As the bet was for a substantial amount,
the CO agreed happily.

Part one of Vissevald's plan was surprise. The Guard unit would attack with
the dawn. Now, such units *never* wake that early, and Vis knew that the
Berets knew that. Thus, he hoped to take the Berets off-guard with an
early-morning mass attack. This was, of course, the distraction.

Part two was Vis himself. Early that morning, before cockscrow, he set out
to scale the steep cliff. Rubber knife clenched in his teeth, plastic hand
grenades strapped to his belt, he began to climb, foot by slow foot. His
reasoning was that the Berets would not have more than one guard at the
cliff; their entire defense was based upon the fact that the cliff was
unclimbable. He would reach the top of the cliff at the same time that his
distraction hit the front gate, sneak in, plant the granades, then leave.
Simple.

Thus, Vis reached the top of the cliff just as the dawn broke, only to
find the one thing that he hadn't expected: an alert sentry. As he pulled
himself over the top of the cliff, the sentry attacked, and a scuffle
ensued. Both Vis' rubber knife, and the sentry's fake gun were lost in the
struggle. As they separated for breath momentarily, they both began to cast
about for weapons, and each came upon a stout stick.

Vis smiled; after all, he was one of the finest fighters in the land, and
now, he was in his element. He swung a mighty blow --

-- and was blocked. Now puzzled, Vis fell into fighting posture, and began
trading blows with the man before him. Though Vis' blows were skilled and
quick, each was blocked by the mysterious sentry. Occasionally, he would
just slip a blow by, and was told, "Glance".

Finally, after a hard bout, Vis delivered a solid blow to the sentry, who
thought for a minute, then fell over. Vis came up to the man, but before
helping him to his feet, asked, "Where did you learn to fight like that?"

"Atenveldt...", said the sentry.

Vis pondered this for a moment, then said, "When you return to your home
land of Atenveldt, tell them of this battle. For there is no shame in being
defeated by the Crown Prince of the East!"

And so, the lone sentry defeated, Vis snuck into the camp, planted his
bombs, and won the bet. And from that day forward, he carried the certain
knowledge that you can meet allies in spirit in the *damnedest* places.

Subject: Books "about" the SCA

Just two quick comments --

Yes, Christopher Stasheff didn't find out about the SCA until after writing
The Warlock in Spite of Himself. *However*, he was so taken by the Society
that he appears to have immediately gone out and written a book about it,
called Escape Velocity, which is a prequel to Warlock. Sadly, Escape Velocity
isn't anywhere near as good a book as Warlock; I'd only recommend it to SCA
completists. The group in it isn't the SCA, but it's clearly based on an
outside view of the Society.

Regarding the portrayal of the Horde in Murder at the War, I must agree with
David le Casse that they were somewhat misshown. It seemed to me that Margaret
blended the Horde and Tuchux into one group, to the extent of attributing
several stories that I have always heard as being Tuchux stunts to the Horde.
It was the only major flaw I found in the book (aside from the normal problems
of a first novel), but it did bother me a fair amount.

Subject:  light was tried

I was talking with a friend who usually plays in Bryn Gwylad, Ansteorra (Austin,
Texas) and he told me that at one time someone tried to implement a light
weapon fighting style.
It consisted of  people using shinai ( a practice sword used in kendo, usually
made of four cut strips of bamboo lashed together at critical points.) and
wearing a fencing mask, gorget, elbow, knee, hokey gloves, and a cup.
(basically kendo armour )The nice part of this, as those of you who have ever
used a shinai can tell, is that shinai will not do serious damage, at worst
they will sting. It however did not last becuase the established people were
too attached to the status quo.

 In reference to Lady Deonora's note, and before this goes too much further,
it was my understanding that the Gentle involved was yanked for unsafe
fighting, not rhinohiding.  To be specific, too many of his blows were landing
on or below the knee.  Most likely due to it having been an overly long 
tourney.  There was much uproar and confusion as to whether the incident was
handled correctly, but it was not attributable to the rhino hiding problem.

I saw Stasheff at Chattacon the year before this one and in the panel
he led he eventually came around to talking about that book.  He hadn't
heard about the society until long after the book was written, and he
said he was pleasantly surprised that the society existed much as he

Yeah!  It is nine volumes, plus a volume of short stories, plus one
or two short stories elsewhere.  I highly recommend it -- especially
for the detail she goes into.  Not too surprising considering her 
background.

The author is Mary Monica Pulver -- SKA Margaret of Shaftesbury.  The
same person who wrote Deer Abbey for The Complete Anachronist.  It's
a nice book, especially as a "first book".  She does manage to capture
the spirit of things rather well, for the most part.  However some things
feel wrong -- especially her treatment of the Horde members.  She has
one of her characters call them the Motorcycle Gang of the SCA, something
which she must believe herself from the way they are treated.  Another
thing is that it seems that all the guys are either nights or squires
or down on themselves because they're neither.

But those are really minor complaints.

One of the really interesting undercurrents is a survey handed out
to people at the troll booth upon checkin.  "Why I joined the Society
for Creative Anachronism" in 25 words or less.  There was quite
a range of answers.


Another book I highly recommend is _The_Lion_Of_Ireland_ by Morgan
Llywelyn.  It's partly a modern re-telling of the Norse saga's
concerning Brian of Boruma (The first Ard Ri of Ireland to actually
unite the whole island and almost drive the foriegners out).  There's
also some fiction along with the truth as told by the saga's.  All
in all it's a very good book however.

If the results aren't too large and or technical maybe you could ask for
permission to post them?

It's been 5 years since I had any involvement in the SCA. But I'd been on 
the fringes for about 10 years. I've seen the armor increases and heard
fighters complain about both "too-hard" blows and "unkillable" fighters.
Judging by what I have heard as to current armor requirements, it does
indeed sound like time for the fighters to say "enough is enough". 

I don't know how hard is hard enough, but I do have a rather graphic
example of too hard. A wrist snap that made 4 inch long by quarter inch
deep dent in *overlapping* plates of a helm. I forget what the legal
requirements are? 16 gauge? whatever they are this was two gauges 
*heavier* than required! And it still got mashed.... 

I have *no* doubt that with a real weapon and a "normal" helm, the
fighter would have had considerable difficulty in extracting his sword from
the remains of the helm...

	My sympathies to our eastern cousins.  It is indeed unfortunate when
one of the rule we need to function traps us.

	I am disturbed to hear that this has become a common occurance.  
I did note when I sent in my renewal (in Jan.) that it took a long time to

Is there a problem at the registrar that is causing this delay?

	A brief story... 

	A couple of years ago, in the Barony of Sternfeld, in the Middle,
I and some friends were attending an event in countryside of the Barony.
The Site was wonderful, with a roofed enclosure and the wains parked some
distance away.  A few of us were a mite discomforted by some omminously
LARGE tracks not far from the Tourney, but our hosts reasured us that these
were of no consiquence.
	The day of the tourney went well, with a fine list followed by 
other diversions, one of which was a siege weapon contest.  All was well
until the ground started to shake.
	Then, with a great roar and much belching of smoke and steam, a 
HUGE dragon, with black shiny hide and legs moving so fast that they were 
but a blur, rush out of the woods and thundered past the campsite, following 
the tracks that we had noticed earlier.  So great was its speed that before 
we could grab lance, nock arrow or move the catapults to bear on it it had
passed from our sight, leaving only the stench of its breath.
	Our hosts of Sternfeld took all of this in great peace, though
several of the visitors took alarm.  When asked the Sternfelders merely
waved it off as if it was of no consiquence.
	Indeed, twice more during the evening the dragon (or one of its 
cousins) roared past, but non took the slightest not of our knights and
men at arms, nor any of our fair ladies that were present either.  I think
it just as well, for I doubt that any of our weapons, even the weapons 
throwing 20 lb stones, could have done much to the beast.

*****************************************************************************

	In any event, calling the craft we sail or ride to events in dragons
is doing the beast we encountered a great injustice.  And the sight of four
or five score anachronists looking up in surprise, some of them yelling
"DRAGON!!!" at the tops of thier voices was hilarious...

>First off, some historical facts.
 
>1.  Tournaments, as we know them and recreate them in the SCA, are a 
>RENAISSANCE phenomenon, *not* a medieval one.

	I beg to differ.  Tournaments were indeed popular in the Middle
Ages.  Look up William Marshall and note when he lived and how he made his
fortune.  I assure you, tourneys are indeed a Medieval phenomenon, as well
as a Renaissance one.

 
>2.  MOST of our cooking, ALL of our dancing (the earliest dance manuals extant
>date from the mid-1400's), and a large chunk of our heraldy and costuming as
>seen in the SCA, is RENAISSANCE, *not* medieval.

	Ah, I see part of the problem.  The Italian Renaissance did indeed 
start in the 15th Cen., but that does not include most of Europe.  England
cannot be said to have entered its Renaissance until the late 16th or even 
early 17th century, the time when the BOD set our cut-off.  

	Second, your assesment totally ignores those of us from periods
significantly before your period.  I'm an 11th century Varangian, I know 
of several well researched and realized pesonna dating centuries before
*me*.  Are you implying that our efforts are for naught?  We have 
12th cen. Norman French cookbooks, are those not Medieval enough for you?

	In short, because much of what *you* do and see in your area
may be Renaissance, does not mean that *all* the Society is so inclined.

 
>Considering these facts, and considering the fact that these are the activities
>we see the most of in the SCA, how can anyone claim that we are PRIMARILY
>a medieval re-creation society?
	
	Your facts are only a limited expresion of the Society's activities.

 
>The BOD notwitstanding, if you go out to the West, you're going to find a lot
>of fighters in full, 16th century plate armour.  And if you're in the east,
>you are far more likely to find the nobility attending court in Renaissance
>garb than you are in medieval garb.  And EVERYWHERE, if they're dancing, they're
>cookbooks (since they are the most readily available period sources).
[Sorry, this paragraph was garbled.]

	Given the evidence I've seen, the armor thing is more of a survival
trait than an indication of the persons persona.  And at Pensic last year
I saw a great deal of variation in costume.  I'll admit that the Ren. 
stuff is more eyecatching, but it is not the most common.


>So it's plain silly to claim that we're a primarily medieval recreation

>animosity towards the East?  All of this because a finalist in the lists
>got called for rhinohiding?

	I hadn't forgotten it, I'd never heard of it!! I'm not from the
East.  Yes, I have seen instances of people not taking blows like they should
have, but not only in Crown Lists.  And I've seen these things get worked out.
There may be exceptions, but *as a rule* I would venture to say that the person
who wins Crown Tourney *is the best fighter who *wants* to*, not simply the 
person who is taking the hardest blows.  In any judged competition there is
the spector of politics, at some level.  I'm *not* saying that this problem
is insuperable, only that it is a serious one that will take far more 
precautions to impliment than a Crown List.

 
>And as for fairness... I have attended 5 or 6 crown torneys, and I have seen

	Evidence for my point.  The people taking heavy blows are *not* the
best fighters.  And they don't seem to be winning do they?

>kings who refuse to do their paperwork, do things against the near

	And there is no evidence to support the unstated position that a
Laurel would automatically be better.

	Do you fence?  Like heavy fighting, there is a considerable physical
component as well as a mental one.  As many people can fance as can heavy,
most will still choose to do neither.

	Also note that the person you are proposing as Winter King would still
be Crown Prince(sse) at Pensic as well.

One of the things that I am noticing lately is that people's definitions of 
what is allowed because of periodness is radically different.  

We often also seem to have decided that because the "SCA" has been doing 
something for a good long time that it becomes legitimate by that reason 
along.

In addition, I see a "multiple-standard" for different types of activity.  
There have been comments about the periodness of plate armor.  There is no 
reason for people to make styles of plate armor that are not period.  There 
are certainly examples of types of plate armor and chain armor etc that come 
from before 1600 that are legitimate AND safe.  Many of our fighters don't 
wear period armor but that's all right with most people.  We use rattan 
weapons for safety reasons.  These have legitimate reasons for being this way, 

The real problem that I see is that we have a number of weapons and fighting 
styles in rattan fighting that just cannot be shown to be period to most 
people.  Many people are using advance modern oriental martial art styles that 
didn't exist until the last two hundred years.  Weapons are frequently more 
employed as katana than broadswords.  Many "halberd" styles are naginata 
based.  This is fine for Master Kobayashi, who has a japanese persona.  
Shields have been specially adapted for SCA combat styles.  We've even 
probably invented a number of totally new techniques not used by others 
anywhere.  The is little evidence in our rattan fighting styles of people 
attempting to be strongly in period.  

Yet people fight voraciously over what style of grip a fencer is using.  I 
have heard that our esteemed Baron here in Carolingia is going to a great deal 
of trouble to measure, weight, and examine period fencing weapons in order to 
be able to accurately replicate them for our use.  I think that this is dandy, 
but if people wanted to use modern foils and fencing techniques the rattan 
fighters and the chivalry should be the last people to complain.  

We have medieval documented materials on war styles and techniques, armor and 
arms (though there is endless debate about what armor and weapons were 
actually used when and where over a large percentage of it).  We have evidence 
of period small tactics and small group combats.  I would be interested in 
seeing some documentation on fighting styles for one-on-one combats in the 
medieval period, because I've never seen it.   I would be much more in favor 
of working rattan fighting as melee groups and whole baronies, with leaders 
being not only reasonably good fighters, but strategists and tacticians as 
well.  I would expect for a person to become king then to be someone who has 
demonstrated the true medieval kingly arts of war.   Not someone who is simply 
the best duelist.  I like the notion of Crown Tournaments becoming real wars.  
Sophia also suggested creating a wargame using medieval tactics and 
strategies, which could be another list ( a real wargame on paper).  A 
different scenario could be created for each tourney.  As such, the high 
person winner combining the dueling and the wargame would become king.  

It was also my experience and impression that many of the older fighters when 
I joined in 78 were using fencing styles with rattan as much as they were 
able.  There seemed to be two major reasons for this.  

1.  The older fighters seem to be mundance fencers often.
2.  Those fighters interested in period documentation could find fencing 
styles for duels (one-on-one), but nonjousting documentation for "real 
medieval knights on foot" was not as evident.  

I also remember when I joined that there were lots of people with ridiculous 
heavy, long, 2-handed bastard swords with large awkward guard pieces that look 
like things you see in medieval armories and textbooks.  They went out of 
fashion even while I was fighting because they weren't particularly as good as 
the faster lighter eastern style swords, and people were more interested in 
winning than in fighting in period, with western medieval styles.  

I also seem to remember that one of the reasons the rapier was invented was to 
deal with nuts in plate armor.  And that in any given area of Europe, plate 
armor was only in style for less than a hundred years, as only a massed unit 
of cavalry in heavy armor was good against rabble armies with pitchforks, and 
a lone "knight" would be pulled down and off in a matter of minutes.  

Well this is enough to give people something to *chew" on for awhile.  I can 
hear the howls on the horizon already from the people who will continue to 
like things just the way they are :-).  That's all right.  

By the way, I (like Master Kobayashi said of himself) often like to play 
devil's advocate.  If you get too upset reading anything I say, remember that 
I probably really sympathize with most people's positions and do not have real
malice towards anyone, not even the political kind.

Hmmm.  Others have already commented some on this, so I'll try to keep it

There are easy ways to judge chess and wargames,  more explicit than a 
fighting tourney.  Heraldry can be judged by a test, rather like the ones you 
may have had in college.  Questions can be asked, and there are answers, wrong 
answers, and better answers.  Heralds have established ways of handling this 
already.  

Certain arts can be more easily judged than others.  On the other hand, having 
a qualification as opposed to a real list may work just as well.  If you 
haven't demonstrated a certain amount of activity and/or ability in a 
some art or craft, why you just wouldn't be qualified to be king.

I wish to thank Eduardo for his courteous reply, and I happily accept
his apology.  The fencing ban in the West may have been as much a 
political ploy as a move for safety.  (No, I have no idea what could be
gained from this)  When King William the Lucky came out with this
proclamation a couple of years back, it appeared that he was banning
something that did not exist, as I hadn't ever seen fencing at an
event.  

As an aside, I am collecting all the postings on the fencing debate,
and I may very well prepare it into a presentation for the current 
royalty (who are actually interested in the opinion of the populace
and the welfare of the kingdom in spite of the King being first and
foremost a rattan man).  

Most, if not all, of the sites we use for events require some form 
of insurance (proof thereof) before they will rent us a hall or 
reserve us a cow pasture.  This is just covering their tender 
pocketbooks in case this unknown group of crazies with swords trashes
their hall.  I don't understand the inner workings of insurance (having
an innate dislike of insurance salesmen doesn't help), but I think the
waivers help us keep our insurance by saying we won't sue if we get
hurt.  Any Pelicans out there with more autocratting experience than I
have?  Can somebody else explain this silliness?

************

||have spoken to, the period of the SCA is the age of the armored
||knight.  In that culture, and in the ethical code that comes with it,
||noblemen do not brawl in the streets with foils, they fight on the
||field of honor with sword and lance.  The paragon of the medieval
||warrior is the chivalrous and honorable knight.  The paragon of the
||fencer is The Three Musketeers, and their dirty tricks.  I have been
||told by a fencer at a tournament "Chivalry has no place in the list of
||fence."  This attitude seems to run exactly counter to the fundamental
||ideas of the SCA.  I do not believe this attitude is prevalent, but I
||do think many non-fencers perceive fencing in that light, and
||disapprove of it for that reason: it just doesn't fit in the SCA.

I have already commented on this to a certain extent.  It has always been my 
perception from actually reading Dumas that the musketeers were VERY 
CHIVALROUS in many ways, fought for the honor of King, Queen, and the glory of 
fighting, fought to protect the status quo, and fought those whom they 
perceived to be enemies of the right.  

The true chivalrous and honorable knight would have rather died than 
relinquish his honor, not that there are many documented examples in fact (not 
in literature) of there being what we would like to "recreate" as knights.  
Any historical text on the crusades will give lots of evidence to support this 
viewpoint. 

FLAME ON***
If we are "recreating" a fantasy/literature viewpoint of what things should 
have been as opposed to the way they really were, then a lot of this talk 
about periodness can just be thrown out the window.  Why not have heraldry as 
it should have been.  Color on Color and Wild crazy devices.  Why not do 
dances that are fun and interesting like Hole in the Wall as opposed to some 
of these hard, ridiculously fast bizarre performance dances that are danced to 
the wrong music anyway.  (oops, I didn't say that.  Please nobody tell my 
knight I said that :-).  Why can't we have food at events that is food as it 
should have been, not some the of awful spiced things I've eaten.  Why can't 
we have zippers (if they're hidden well).  
FLAME OFF***

Please note that I'm not advocating one way or the other here.  I just feel 
that the Society if amazingly schizophrenic with regards to this topic.  I 
think that historical research is neat, and should be done so we know what we 
want to change.  But denying anything on the grounds of periodness (which 
seems to happen an awful lot whereever it's convenient for the person arguing 
it, and never when it's not) just doesn't seem to hold up under careful 
examination.

Subject: Reply to: In Defence of Rattan Fighting

Good Master Kobayashi, I would never throw vegetables at a member
of the chivalry  :-) 

These two "outrageous claims" are actually sound points.  The arguments
for arts kings come up every so often, and have so far always died down
again.  Putting myself at considerable political risk here, I will tell
some truths:  The same guy that came up with the five-fold tourney 
was the one who banned fencing in the West.  His queen wore blue jeans
to court.  He changed the laws of the Order of Precedence and knighted 
a person that 98% of the Chivalry despised.  He didn't want people to
address him as 'your majesty'.  These seem to typify the sort of things 
that many people want to avoid in kings.  The man in question is
a Triple Peer.  Not even Laurels can be counted on to be great kings.
I'm not saying that rattan fighting is and always shall be the best way
to determine a monarch, but just because they can herald, and 
calligraph, and dance, and play chess doesn't guarantee that the winner
would be any "better" as a monarch than Joe Stickjock.  

On the art of rattan fighting in the SCA:
My knight and my squire-brother have been writing down moves, shots,
footwork, feints, etc.  in an attempt to look at fighting in a similar 
way to how other marshal arts are viewed.  Rattan fighting doesn't have
set katas, but the elements of fighting break down in interesting ways.
Have other people tried this sort of thing?  Would others be interested 
in Eric and John's notes?

I must most heartily agree with Master Kobayashi's claims.  It is NOT
true that any dork with a sword can be king.  Once you know what  to
look for, you can tell if a fighter has tight control of his blows, 
good stance, good targeting, and such that make a fight elegant.  
[one of the most beautiful things to watch is a bout between two 
skilled greatswordsmen}  Non-fighters are generally quicker to think
that bogus blows should have been taken.  Shots do glance, and hit tippy
and catch shield, and hit flat.  Come out to a couple fighter practices,
climb inside some armor, and see how accurately you judge blows,
especially when you're new.  Now, I know most of you don't yap about how 
Sir X should have taken that leg shot, but I have heard people,
experienced SCA people, do so.  I hope to be given the benefit of the
doubt when I'm on the field, and I'm careful in extending this courtesy
to others.

Good Gentles--particularly Master Kobayashi Yutaka--

As I read the quantity of mail accumulated, including Master Kobayashi's
note, it did sound like the fighters were getting beaten up on the net
as well as on the field.  The high visibility, opportunity for flashy
power roles, and idolization of fighters practised by some gentles, although
not unpleasant, also make fighters excellent targets.     And as in all
areas of the SCA--fighting, fencing, arts, etc--there will always be
certain individuals whose actions will give credence to any criticisms.

The fighters are most certainly part of the charm and beauty (under the
dirt, sweat and odd makeshift armor) that is uniquely SCA and helps create
the illusion of another time.  Those fighters who combine chivalry, fair
play and skill in their weapon form (of which there are many, but could
always be more) are especially to be admired.  I must confess that as the lady
of a fencer and list mistress for the Carolingian Rapier Company, I would like
to see greater note taken of fencing and for it to grow to an equal footing
with heavy lists, but it is comparatively young and these things take time.

Speaking as someone who used to fight (though by no means well), I must
agree with Master Kobayashi.  Sure, there are some "stick jocks" out
there.  There are also people who *only* dance, or *only* scribe, or
*only* do heraldry, or *only* brew/drink, or *only* play music, or ...
My point is that *anyone* who does only one sort of thing in the Society
is being narrow.  I think that a lot of the "problem" with the stick
jocks is that they are a quite visible group.  Tournies take a long time
in public places.

And yes, fighting well, and especally learning about medieval combat in
the process, takes a *lot* of time dedication, and _skill_.  Many people
don't believe it, and therein lies quite a bit of the "stick jock"
problem.

Living in the MidRelm, I think that the quality of royalty we have had
during the time that I have been a member is no worse than if it were
selected from any other arbitrary group.  (On the other hand, some of
this qualtiy may be the result of a non-chivalry-by-invitation-only
Crown List, but I think that the benifits of it far outweigh the
problems, but I digress.)

So, lets try to cut each other a little bit more slack, and try to
appriciate the work of others, no matter what it may be.

Subject: Re: sca: fencing blade inspection
Message-Id: <5020001@hpfcmr.HP.COM>

Pardon me, but the discussion looks much like detecting metal flaws.....


An inexpensive method to detect metal cracks is to apply a dye called
Prussian Blue to the metal of interest let it soak for awhile, then 
wipe the PB off with a cloth. Following the wipe, a white powder (like talc)is
applied to the metal. PB absorbed into a crack in the metal will re-emerge
into the white powder and stain the powder. Voila! Indication of 
a crack. 

An alternative method is to use something called  "ultrasonic inspection" 
where a transducer is applied to the metal and a sonar-like process of
transmission and reflection from material boundaries occurs. The 
machine isn't cheap and requires significant training to use properly.
But it can detect subsurface defects.

Yet another technique is called "magnaflux" where a magnetic field is
induced so as to permeate the metal. Iron powder is sprinkled onto the 
metal and the orientation of the iron particles is studied. Discontinuities
such as cracks and voids will have a different magnetic field and thus
a different distribution of iron particles around them.This also can
detect subsurface defects.

And for the ultimate environmental insult, RADIOGRAPHY. Use a radiation
source to "illuminate" the metal. Capture an image on film using the 
radiation source. (This is effectively like medical or dental X-rays).
This will also detect subsurface defects.

For use on small items such as fencing equipment, the Prussian Blue 
method is most practical. (outside of ignoring the problem of course)

The above are standard techniques for metal fabricating trades.
I happened to have learned about it in the Navy.

Warmest Greetings from Trimaris.  Yes, we even receive you down here...

A quick comment on the Consort's Melee mentioned a ways back:

What about letting the performance of a consort in such a melee *add* to
that of the lord/lady fighting for her/him instead of making it 2 completely
independent contests?  It becomes a mutual effort.  It would also alter the
philosophy of chosing a consort...

And one personal request:

I've been trying to start a chapter of Arachne's Web, the lace making guild,
started here.  I could use some advice from the established chapters in
other kingdoms but I've been unable to find who to contact.  If anyone can
send me the name and address of your local Web guildmistess or relevent
gentle, I would be deeply grateful!

My two shillings worth m'lords n ladies ...

It is seemly that the usual crown tourney should tend towards selecting
"sword jocks" as Kings.  The only thing to prevent this is the selection
of who competes in the crown tourneys -- in most kingdoms the chivalry
and invited guests.

Is this necessarily bad?  Well, speaking for the Middle Kingdom I
think we would do well to have our war king be something more than
a normal sword jock.  :-)  He/she should be capable of diplomacy
in making allies and in mass battle strategy.  Other kingdoms surely
have similar needs.

By adding in extra competitions to the crown tourney a kingdom
could improve this some.  But it's up to each individual kingdom.

non-fighters were essential participants.  Hence the team idea.

	I didn't mean to imply any of that.  I mean have a clear fighter-
consort link as we have now, only have the consort compete as well.  The
best combined score for the two wins.  Thus all of your objections are
null.

	I beg to differ, if only in the definition of the word 'safe'.  While
I'll agree that injuries are less likely in fencing than in heavy, when those
injuries do occur they are more likely to be life-threatening.  I've seen 
injuries in both forms, and fencing wounds are *much* scarier.  So the
injuries may be less common, but that doesn't mean it is 'safer'.

Subject: Fencing Crowns


I have heard a large number of people come down in favour of fencing
as a way of deciding the crown tournaments.  I must respectfully
disagree with them, even though I am a fencer myself.

To begin with, I must say that switching from rattan to fencing as a way of
deciding crowns will cause no improvements.  Rhinohiding is as
potentially as large a problem in both lists, and a "wire-jock" as
crown could be just as disasterous as having a "stick-jock."

Let us look at what is really required of the Monarch.  First Their
Majesties must be able to provide sufficient bread and cirrcuses for
the masses.  Unfortunatly, there is no way to test for this one before
the Monarchs assends the throne.  Secondly, their Majesties must be
able to judge in matters pertaining to all activities going on with
the society, but in particular, with give out awards.  True, Their
Majesties do and should rely heavily on the populace (in particular in
the members of their poling orders) to carry out those duties, but
they need at least a passing familiarity in order to perform those
duties well.

Perhaps we should require that potential Monarchs have a passing
familiarity with the other aspects of life in the Current Middle Ages.
The East Kingdom already requires a residency (of I believe 1 year)
and travelling to a sufficient number of events during that time over
sufficiently diverse locations that Their Most Royal Majesties will
provide bread anc circusses for at least a large portion of the
masses.  We might further go on to require that Their Majesties had
some passing familiarity with the other arts as well.

Thus a typical requirement for entry in the Crown Tourney would be:
For the Monarch 
	1) SCA member
	2) Residency and Travelling
	3) Must practice 1 art or science at a sufficient level to be
able to display his/her at crown Tourney.
	4) Must perform sufficient service to the society that at
least 5 people (2 out of local group) will testify in writing to the
service.
	5) Qualified Fighter (to enter Tourney)
For the Consort
	1-4) above
	5) Either a qualified figher to fencer (i.e., has some
familiarity with the fighting arts) or an extra art/science or extra
service.  

The new reigning Monarch would still be selected by the tourney as
before, it is just that now the Monarch cannot be purely a
"Stick-jock" (or "Wire-jock") as in the other proposals.  This system
is I think both workable and practical, however, I offer it mainly for
the sake of disscussion.

I just wanted to apologize to the Lady Coranna, as I in no way intented for 
her to think that I doubted her word or was calling it into question.  I 
certainly believed what she was saying.  What I could not believe was that 
there was anybody who would attempt to ban fencing on the basis that it is 
more dangerous than rattan fighting, and that allowing insurance people to 
classify rattan fighting in the same category as pingpong is silly, if not 
dangerously stupid.  How come we sign these waivers anyway?  We have 
insurance?  Canadian SCA has insurance?  Hmmmmm.

Greetings to all!

For those of you who I haven't had the electronic honor of meeting

since this SCAnet began a few weeks ago, and it seems to have been
well-received.  So, if anyone wants to talk heraldry, either their
own, or someone else's, via e-mail or on this bboard, I would love to
help, argue, or otherwise schmooze.  At last count, we have some 25

since I can't really fight but I can do (or learn) the others.  Not to

Subject: SCA Bureaucracy

So the new prince of the East isn't -- because he forgot to renew his
membership.  Not very smart, was it?  Of course, he's still a member, but his
membership expires at the end of the month.  And it takes a couple of months to
renew.

Is there any earthly reason it should take more than a few days?  And even if
there is (e.g. the person handling renewals prefers to do several hundred at a
time instead of as they come in) when did we become so inflexibly rule-bound?

I'm not particularly upset over the oversetting of the Crown, but I *don't*
care for the bureaucratization it implies.

We have a local member whose name was rejected, not for inappropriateness or
lack of authenticity, but because it was longer than the number of characters
the SCA database allows for names.  (Yes, it was very long.  What of it?)

The past couple of years have seen an explosion in the volume of reporting
being demanded of local officers by their Kingdom superiors.  Some of the
requested reports make some sort of sense -- others will never be read.

OK.  Let's grant that a society of 10,000 members requires more structure than
a society of 1,000 members.  It's still a case that that structure is there to
serve the membership, and not the other way around.  IT IS A MYTH that a large
bureacracy is necessarily impersonal and unresponsive.  Those are
characteristics not of large bureacracies but of bureaucracies whose members
have no stake in what they do and no incentive to do it well.  That should not
characterize the society.

Subject: In Defence of Rattan Fighting

I am Master Kobayashi Yutaka of the East, Seneschal of Carolingia,
and Various Other Things.  The "Master" is for "Master-at-Arms".

I must admit to feeling a bit put upon.  The general impression that
i'm getting is that if all the fighters in the Known World, and everything
associated with them, were suddenly to vanish into a black hole, the
rest of you would breathe a collective sigh of relief, all of your
problems solved.  No more stupid stick jocks on the throne.   No more
boring tourneys.  No more macho braggarts strutting their ignorance
about.

Well, i want to make two outrageous claims on the subject:

Outrageous Claim #1: There is as much art in fighting as there is in
	anything else.

Outrageous Claim #2: If you are not a fighter, you know not whereof you speak.

[pause to dodge vegetable matter flung in my direction.  effort not entirely
successful.]

Let me explain...

Number 1 is actually not that difficult, but people forget so it deserves
mentioning now and again.  If the spectators only cheer the winner, then
that is what the fighter notices.  If the spectators cheer both impartially,
because the bout was well-fought, or the kill was particularly spectacular,
the fighter will notice that as well.  When is the last time you went up to
a fighter and said, "Well-fought.  I enjoyed watching"?

Which brings me to #2.

Nothing will glaze a fighter's eyes faster than some bozo coming up after a
fight and describing "the perfect move" that would have carried the day.  The
description is confusing, and the move itself was gleaned from the most
recent episode of Flying Fists of Death Theatre.  The encounter ends more
or less politely, depending on the individuals, and the fighter's opinions have
not changed one iota.

People feel foolish if they find they've been holding forth on an art and one
of the listeners turns out to be a Laurel in that art.  Why don't fighters
get the same respect in their field?  It's just as ill-defined as many arts
i can think of, has at least as many schools of practice, and is amenable to
the same sort of snobbery.  Why doesn't anyone feel badly when they haven't
bothered to learn *our* jargon-words and we can't understand them, or they
us?  Why do all these people hate us *when they haven't even taken the time to
see what's involved*?  [Whine.  Whine.]

The more one knows about something, the more one can appreciate it.  *Learn*
about fighting, ask questions of fighters, and the tourneys won't be so boring.
As a side effect, when you want to say something to a fighter it will have
more impact, because you will be knowlegeable and be able to convey your idea.

This is already too long.  I have *much* more to say, but would rather
not flood the net with my ravings.

Message-Id: <389@lehi3b15.UUCP>

Greetings unto the knowne world from David Waxthorn, a simple Norman
administrator with a funny name.

I am mundanely a member of the fencing club here at Lehigh, and we do
not participate in electronic tournaments.  The style of fencing
taught here is much more 'nasty' than tournament rules allow -
although we are taught the rules of dry-fencing.  (Please - no USFA
flames.  We view fencing as a martial art, and happily abide by all
USFA rules when fencing others).

One of the first things we are taught is how to break a blade (#2
foil) and stab someone in the throat.  It is simply a hard 2 or 5
extension without turning the wrint over.  The blade tries to bend
along the wrong axis, breaks, and impales your opponent.  The reason
we are told this is that not turning the wrist over is a common
mistake of novices, and fear of causing injury is a great motivator
for correct technique.  Therefore, a blade does not need to be
fatigued or cracked in order to break.

In my experience with SCA fencing, I have used an epee blade.  I have
NEVER used a hack/slash attack - it is too dangerous.  I do, however,
use draw cuts often; therefore, I do not agree that the edge of an
epee should be disallowed.

Fencing should be fun.  It does not matter to me if I win or die -
only if I have enjoyed the duel.  Too many people take this too
seriously, and they are the ones that make it less enjoyable.

Now, how do I fit this in with my persona ;-)

(An aside to Michael Squires--I tried to send you mail but don't know

I think this is a fascinating and legitimate (certainly!) area of
inquiry in the SCA.

The Barony of Carolingia (Boston, Mass., area) runs a University each
year, which is like a combined event and demo--mundanes may attend, and
it is publicized mundanely on a limited scale.  The lecturers are SCA
scholars, who give their lectures in persona.  The topics are strictly
medieval ones (such as astronomy, or the hierarchy of angels.)  This 
comes closer to re-creating the medieval sort of university, than other
types of Schola/University events seem to.  Our yearly Schola event
here in Debateable Lands is run by our College of Cour d'Or, and seems
to be moving in the direction of becoming more authentic, but the
process is necessarily slow.  There is always a need to offer
instruction about the SCA itself, for the benefit of newcomers, and
because it helps us gain some perspective on our organization.

My lord, Magnus, admires the medieval ideal of the itinerant scholar
but has yet to construct a persona around it.

I think this is a fascinating area which is large unplumbed in the SCA.
Are there any groups out there who have tried to re-create university
life?

Subject: fencing kinda stuff


	Greetings to you all.  I have fenced mundanely for 4 years and
fenced in the Society for one year and I have seen only 3 accidents in 
that entire time.  1) A bloody nose (mask was too big). 2) A teammate 
didn't wear his cup. 3) A small cut on the back of a teammates neck
from a sabre cut - back of the head protection is a good idea.
	A friend of mine claims to have been at the infamous World Games where
the Russian took one through the mask, she said it was pretty spooky but
accidents happen.  Obviously, we can only take safety so far, but don't 
throw out the baby with the bath water [I always wanted to say that :-)]
Procedures have been developed to determine whether blades and masks are
safe and the marshallate should enforce safety regs concerning conduct on
the field and equipment safety.
	As far as calibration levels go, I have noticed how hard it is
to sometimes get a touch acknowleged.  I don't think I 'RhinoHide' but
when you are in a tourney situation and the adrenalin is racing...
One thing I usually will *not* acknowledge is a slap in lieu of a draw
cut.  It may not be the best way to reduce the chance of getting beaten
to death but you do get your opponents attention concerning the subject.
Luckily its only happened to me once or twice.
	I have noticed that if people are hitting harder I do tend to 
get a little numb, but a lot of time this happens when I work with 
new people, both in mundane and period fencing.  When I was learning
to fence I would have bruises on my body because myself and the other 
novices had no concept of proper fencing distance and we'd sit there
and whale on each other while being way too close.  Proper distance
and footwork will reduce these kinds of injuries and would reduce
calibration levels.  While I am far from being a fencing teacher
the first thing I try to work with new people is proper, classical
footwork  (which is definitely not the way I first learned) and we go
slowly from there.  When I was on the college team, I had hardly any
bruises or injuries, our coach really drilled us in footwork. 
	Consequently, the main reason the Europeans do so much better
than Americans in mundane fencing is their stronger emphasis on 
footwork.

	Here in the East Kingdom, pistol grips will be outlawed in
August.  What is the current status in other kingdoms?  It seems to
me that the marshallate should legislate safety not what is period.

	
	In other things, My Lord Baron Arnulf Adler can be reached thru
email sent to me...

A good intro I recently picked up is: The Medieval Machine -- The Industrial
Revolution of the Middle Ages by Jean Gimpel (Victor Gollancz LTD, London,
1977).  The 10th thru 12th centuries were a period of significant intellectual
ferment.  For example, the eleventh century Archbishop of Canterbury, Saint
Anselm wrote:
        It seems to me negligent, if after we have been confirmed in the
        faith, we do not strive to understand what we believe.

The ideal scientific library of the time (most likely located in Toledo) would
doubtless contain the following  recent (for the time) translations:

On the contrary, wagon or wain works well for a wagon, not for a smoke-snorting
contraption that moves without anything pulling it, and valet or butler works
well for a person who takes messages, not for a box which does so.

Terms like dragon and golem  are not used to turn our medieval recreation into
the creation of a fantasyland.  They are used in reference to inescapably
mundane aspects of life in the modern middle ages.  I don't think it detracts
from the magic to give the products of modern technology the sorts of names
that could indeed have arisen from the collision of such products with a
medieval world view.

--Dani

Au contraire, I think part of the problem lies in the fact that WE most 
certainly CAN tell the difference between our fairly advanced technology
and magic.  And for anyone who still believes a little bit in dragons, it
is an annoyance to have someone else refer to a mere automobile as one.
   "Wagon" implies horse-drawn, and is incorrect only in the absence of 
the horses.  The cultural aspects are all proper--anyone can own one,
a peasant will have a wagon whereas a lord might have a carriage, and
so forth.

Subject: Arrgghh!!  That word!  Not again!

I refer, of course, to the word "Dream". Capitalized.  Frequently preceeded
by "The", also capitalized.  To return to the discussion of religion, somehow
in the last three or so years, a new religion has been invented, and not 
content with proselytizing, the practitioners have wholesale, not to mention
willy nilly, inducted us all into it, without so much as a by-your-leave or
'nuttin.
	I am *not* "following The Dream", nor will I teach people (new or 
old) about it, nor do I even know what any given individual *MEANS* when
he/she refers to "The Dream".  In the same way that "may the blessing of 
the One Supreme Being, there is no other, be upon you, unworthy error-prone
disbeliever that you are" could be construed as (just possibly) mildly
annoying to the person addressed, so I find exhortations to "keep The Dream
alive", or signatures such as "in service to The Dream".  
	Flame Off.  I mean it.  It really bugs the h*ll out of me, it has
connotations of cultism, it implies a Greater Purpose to the SCA (which I
don't believe exists), and finally, it seems like a modern (well, 19th
century) turn of phrase.

For those who don't know, or who didn't understand the brief signature at
the bottom, this was originally written by the Chronicler of the Society,
smor@<i dont remember the machine> and posted by her. 

Furthermore, Lord Arval's article regarding the relevance of fencing
in the SCA and exactly what was being recreated (to wit, that in the
period we are recreating "fencing" was actually street brawling) is
practically verbatim from some comments made by Her Majesty Sedalia at
this weekend's East Kingdom Crown Tourney.

Lord Arval, it is generally considered polite to properly attribute
what one is repeating. This is usually taken to mean including the
entire name/appelation of the person, which in the case of the net is
usually their originating uname@machine.

From Arval Benicoeur, Brigantia Principal Herald,
To the people of the East, Greetings!

Hear these, the words of Gavin Rex Orientalis:

East Kingdom Crown tournament, fought Saturday 21 May, has been
voided.  Quondam Prince Lucan discovered on reaching home after
winning the tournament that his SCA membership is going to expire for
the month of June.  Current BoD policy requires that all Royalty and
heirs must maintain their membership without lapse through the entire
period as heir and crown, so Lucan cannot serve as Crown Prince.

Crown Tournament will be re-fought Sunday 3 July in the Shire of Black
Rose, where they are having a three-day camping event over the long
4th of July weekend.

Nobody likes this situation, but BoD policy is inflexible.  This is
the third Crown Tournament which has been so voided this year.



As a postscript from Brigantia to all Eastern heralds: please try to
arrange to be at Crown Tourney.  I can use all the help I can get
heralding the lists.

		Arval.

First question:  where is this person?  Sometimes groups overlap a little,
perhaps by traveling a bit farther, he can find more congenial folks.

We have an armourers' guild.   One of the things it does is to help new
people make armor.  We also have a Knight Marshall who is supposed to
help new people learn to fight without extracting fealty.  Contrariwise,
I did not find it easy to learn to fight until after I left college, as
a car was real useful, and it IS an expensive hobby.  I still don't fight,
but now its my own fault.

Good luck, keep trying, don't worry about your persona (its more typical than
you might think), and finally, consider trading fealty for training, at 
least on a temorary basis.  One of the big differences between then and now is 
that it doesn't have to be forever.  Helping someone else schlep their armor
in exchange for having them help you make and use yours is not such a bad
deal.

To the Knowne World, Greetings!

I received massive response to my test posting to this group, for
which I thank you all.  I have determined that this group does indeed
get distributed from Maine to Australia.  Don't bother to send any
more replies to that request: I am quite satisified!

Many of you asked what the SCA is.  This posting, prepared by the
Chronicler of the Society,  should help.  Feel free to followup with
questions...they will be happily answered. 

 
             Life in the Current Middle Ages
             _______________________________
 
SCA is the Society for Creative Anachronism, which is a group
dedicated to recreating the Middle Ages in the present. Many
groups meet weekly, and at these meetings we dance, talk, study,
learn, revel, and make plans. But first, let's get a little bit
of info about the SCA in general.
 
              Where did the SCA come from?
              ___________________________
 
 The avowed purpose of the SCA is the study and recreation of the
 Middle Ages, its crafts, sciences, arts, traditions, literature,
 etc. The SCA "period", its definition of the Middle Ages is 600 AD to
 1600 AD. Under  the aegis of the SCA we study dance, calligraphy,
 medieval martial arts,  cooking, metalwork, stained glass, costuming,
 literature.... 
 well, if they did it, somebody in the SCA does it (Except die of
 the Plague!).
 
 As you can probably guess, the thing that separates the SCA from
 a Humanities 101 class is the *active* participation in the
 learning process. To learn costuming, you design and build
 costumes. To learn SCA infantry fighting, you make armor,
 weapons, shields, etc., and put them on and go learn how it
 feels to wear them when somebody is swinging a (rattan) sword at
 you. To learn brewing, you make (and sample!) your own wines,
 meads and beers.
 
 You will frequently hear a SCA person describe the SCA as
 recreating the Middle Ages "as they ought to have been." In some
 ways this is true -- we have few plagues, indoor plumbing, few
 peasants. In the dead of winter we have other things to eat besides
 King's venison, salt pork and dried tubers.
 
 The SCA was invented (? discovered? begun?) in 1966 in Berkeley,
 California by a group of Science Fiction and Fantasy fans who
 wanted a "theme" party. Following the party, a group got
 together to discuss the idea of a medieval re-creation and
 re-enactment group. (which has ended up being much like the
 Civil War, Revolutionary War or Buckskinning re-enactment groups
 that were beginning to form in the US.) In Britain Medieval and
 British Civil War recreation societies had existed for any
 number of years. The Californians incorporated as a non-profit
 educational society, started forming groups, and away they went.
 
 Since 1966, the society has grown to include nearly 13,000
 paying members in the US, Canada, Mexico, Great Britain,
 Germany, Italy, France, Korea, Okinawa, New Zealand, Australia
 and Greenland. Current demographic estimates indicate that for
 every dues-paying member there are 4 non-subscribing members
 active in local groups.
 
               How is the SCA Organized?
               ________________________
 
 The SCA is a feudal society. No democracies for us! The SCA
 "Knowne World" is divided into twelve Kingdoms, each with a King
 and Queen (who rule by right of arms), a Prince and Princess
 (heirs to the throne), and a council or Curia of Great Officers
 who handle the mundane, day to day details of running the
 kingdom.
 
 A feudal society takes its form from the idea of honor and duty.
 A noble owes duty of service to his lord, a Baron or Knight.
 Knights owe in return the duty of protection from danger and
 food, money, etc. when times are bad.
 
 On the next level up, the Knights owe fealty (the word that
 encompasses this idea of reciprocal responsibilities) to the
 King. In return for their service as good stewards of the land
 and readily available warriors, the King owes the Knights and
 barons protection, honor, and a return of money, food, etc in
 times of hardship. It is something like the idea of a Pyramid
 club, but the benefits are greater and the idea of personal
 honor and mutual responsibility, not profit, tie the structure
 together (or at least it did in Europe for nearly a thousand
 years).
 
 In the SCA this structure underlies our Society, although not
 nearly as rigidly as in the medieval days. Our King, the head of
 our Kingdom and our liege lord, has fought for the right to bear
 the crown by fighting in a Crown Tourney for the right to make
 his Lady Queen. <In the case of female fighters, she has fought
 for the right to make her Lord King Consort.> In some Kingdoms,
 like the West (middle California), the King's word is law, and
 the people willingly obey his every whim. Of course, four months

 interesting.
 
 Fighting in the SCA, or Why are those people hitting each other?
 _______________________________________________________________
 
 Fighting in the SCA evolved from what happened when two armed
 knights were unhorsed and had to fight on the ground. It
 resembles nothing so much as medieval infantry fighting. There
 are two basic types of SCA fights: single combat, and group or
 team battles, known as melees. SCA fighting does have rules. The
 first, and most important rule, is that each and every fighter
 on the field has honor. The fighter keeps faith with his honor
 by accepting blows that would be killing or wounding (more about
 this a little later).
 
 The second is like unto it; A fighter keeps faith with his
 brother fighters by acknowledging his opponent's word -- if he
 says it was light, it was light. Since we prefer that no one get
 hurt, SCA fighting is done with real armor (made with leather,
 metal, padding, kydex, etc) and rattan swords. Rattan is that
 bamboo-y stuff, only with a solid core, that furniture is made
 of. Rattan, surprisingly enough, is springy enough to absorb
 some of the force of the blow (although blows are *real solid*)
 and light enough to approximate a real steel sword. Swords are
 made by wrapping rattan staffs with strapping tape, covering
 them with duct tape (known as silver tape) for esthetic reasons,
 and attaching some sort of hilt or handle. Armor is much more
 complex -- some armor, being made of steel, rivets, leather,
 etc, can take more than 40 hours per piece of armor (for
 example, a armored "glove" with moving fingers and joints can
 take upwards of 75 hours to complete).
 
 There are several essential and required pieces of armor --
 helm, neck and cervical vertebrae protection, elbows and knees,
 kidneys, hands, groin. After that, most SCA fighters wear chest,
 leg, arm and forearm, and feet protection.
 
 If a blow hits hard enough that a sword would have cloven mail,
 it is "good". Beginning fighters, as they are being trained, are
 taught blow calibrations. Fighters are trained, by the way.
 Aspiring fighters attend some months of fighter practices where
 they learn the rules and learn how to protect themselves on the
 field. After some time, they attempt to "authorize" -- they go
 before a panel of experienced fighters, fight a couple of
 rounds, and if the panel decides the fighter is safe (not good,
 you understand, but unlikely to hurt him or herself or an
 opponent) they are authorized to fight in Tourneys. This process
 (from starting to fight to being authorized) can take from a
 couple of months to a year or more.
 
 Fighting brings us to *the Chivalry.* The Chivalry is a group of
 elite fighters -- those who have gotten very very good at
 fighting, and who at the same time have absorbed the concepts of
 Honor and Chivalry (they're basically good guys), have learned
 something of basic Heraldry, Chess, something about the Arts and
 Sciences, can behave well in public, and are generally good
 examples for people everywhere.
 
 (The word Chivalry comes from the Old French *chevalerie*
 <related to the Spanish *caballeria*>, meaning horse-fighter,
 cavalry, "knight". It came to French and Spanish from Latin
 caballerius, horse rider. As only the wealthy could afford the
 horse and trappings of a mounted warrior, it became the province
 of the nobles to be mounted and fighters. Thus the elite status.
 The word has come down to us from a different route as
 *cavalry*. Oh, well!) <There are rank-equivalents to Knights in
 the Arts and Sciences, called "Laurels", and in the Services,
 called "Pelicans". I will discuss them later on!>
 
 A King (if he is himself a Knight, and not all Kings are) can
 knight a fighter if he (or she) thinks the candidate is
 deserving. Usually the other Chivalry have agreed, or it doesn't
 happen. (If the King isn't a Knight, another member of the
 Chivalry can hold the sword with the King. Only a Knight can
 make a Knight.) The Knights swear personal fealty to the Crown.
 Since some people, for religious reasons, reasons of personal
 honor, etc, feel that swearing fealty is inappropriate for them,
 a branch of Chivalry has been created, called Masters, who do
 not have to swear fealty. Upon receiving the accolade of
 Knighthood, the candidate receives a Gold chain to wear about
 the neck, a white belt, and gold spurs. Some receive a *real*
 sword, as well.
 
       Why Do you all have such funny names?
       _____________________________________
 
 Every person in the SCA picks a name to use in the Society. It
 could be something simple (George of Wardcliff) or something
 elaborate (Dughall Aislean nic mac Lathurna). Most people pick a
 time period in the SCA "period" (between 600 and 1600) and a
 country (any place that can documentably be proven to have had
 trade with western Europe during the period), and choose a name
 from that. Some people just pick a name and forget about it;
 some have elaborate persona stories to go with their names.
 
 Even our towns have new names. Lansing, MI, is Northwoods,
 Toronto is Septentria, Boston is Carolingia, the San Francisco
 bay area is the Principality of the Mists, etc.
 
 Most folk in the SCA register their names and a heraldic device
 that they design to represent them. Also, later in their SCA
 careers, they may be given awards and rank, at which time their
 devices become "Arms" and they are most properly called "Lord"
 or "Lady So-and-So."
 
 Rank in the SCA, or How Come She is Wearing a Crown?
 ____________________________________________________
 
 There are two sorts of peers in the SCA; Royal Peers and Peers.
 Royal Peers are folk who have worn the crown of a Kingdom or
 Principality at least once. Ex-Princes are Viscounts,
 Ex-Princesses Viscountesses, and from there it gets complex.
 Those who have been King or Queen once are Counts/Countesses.
 Those who have been King or Queen twice are Dukes/Duchesses.
 Those who have been King or Queen more than that are generally
 considered masochistic! (Small in-joke!) Seriously, there are
 many who have reigned at least three times, and in the West
 there is a legendary Duke who has been King eight times.
 
 Other sorts of Peers are folk who, through dint of talent, hard
 work, and long effort, are recognized for their contributions
 and skills. We have already talked about the Knights. There are
 also the Laurels (Talented craftsmen and artists, recognized for
 having talents and being willing to teach and be gracious), and
 the Pelicans (generally skilled bureaucrats -- somebody *has* to
 do the hard paperwork of running a Kingdom with 3000 people in
 it, and some people keep working at this sort of task for
 years.). The Pelican was thought in medieval times to be the
 most self-sacrificing animal -- it was thought a Pelican would
 pierce her beast to allow her heart's blood to drip into the
 mouths of her offspring when food was short. Peers are made by
 the desire of the King and Queen in accordance with the
 recommendations of the rest of the order.
 
          Feasting, Dancing and Merrymaking
          ________________________________
 
 One of the most interesting parts of the SCA is the Events --
 the times when we put on our costumes, go out and dance those
 dances we've been practicing, flirt, eat, talk, and generally
 party. Events are held almost every weekend of the year
 somewhere in the country. Most groups hold at least one event
 per year; some larger groups will hold two or more.
 
 At events there are often tourneys, art exhibits or
 competitions, dance classes, workshops, and, later in the
 evening, Royal or Baronial Court, and dancing. Many times there
 will be a Feast in the evening. Other times, for smaller events
 or if a newer group is holding the event, there will be a
 dessert revel (People go out for dinner and then come back for a
 dessert buffet).
 
 The events are the most fun to most folk, because you get to go
 and show off all the things you have been learning in the past
 few months.
 
          What Kind of Person Joins the SCA?
          __________________________________
 
 SCA folk tend to be people like you and me -- just plain folks,
 but people who enjoy doing something more with their weekends. A
 high percentage of SCA members are involved in high tech fields
 -- Computers, Aerospace, high energy physics, etc. This has been
 attributed to the fact that people who play all week with highly
 complex, modern technology find it highly relaxing to spend
 their leisure time working with a different kind of technology,
 in a less modern setting. There are lots of people in all fields
 in the SCA -- historians, writers, secretaries, law enforcement
 personnel, teachers, programmers, insurance agents -- the appeal
 of the SCA is widespread.
 
 A housemate of a SCA person recently said: "From what I can tell
 about these wild and crazy SCA people, they do more than just
 this fighting thing. They really like to make and wear the
 medieval clothes (garb), eat the medieval food, dance the
 medieval dances to the medieval music, maybe even make their own
 medieval music, and other medieval party type activities. They
 also seem to like to be medieval so they can relax and have a
 good time. They are quite willing to talk about SCA or invite
 you to the SCA stuff or whatever."
 
               How You Can Get Involved
               _______________________
 
 We welcome you to our local meetings and our events. You needn't
 join the SCA, Inc, to attend and participate (although if you
 decide to be with us regularly you may wish to join). The only
 requirement to come to an event is that you make some attempt at
 pre-1600 costume -- and most groups have "loaner" costumes for
 people who want to come to their first event.
 
 If you want more information about groups near you, you can call
 our corporate office in Milpitas, CA, at (408) 262-5250, or send
 a notice to this mailing list or newsgroup, or contact the

>>(or whatever failure mode it is that causes fencing blades to break,

Unexpected?  Well not exactly, one may say, not predictable.  Blade breakage
occures due to fatigue of metal, which the USFA chair of its tech committee
described to me as microscopic cracks develop... these are the points where the
blade will break.  (Yes, the meterials people will also talk of crystalization 
and...)

So to detect these cracks, one may use an experimental sonic device which shows
stress formations within the metal... well that is a bit expensive, and not
readily available to any marshal. :-)

The FIE requires the use of "miraging steel" blades.  This is a treatement
process that resists cracking.  The blades are much more reliable and break
less often... and not usually under dangerous conditions.  IE: The blade will
break in an attempt to straighten it... not in the lunge that actually did the
bending.  These blades are still new and are still undergoing the test of time.

How do you detect metal fatigue?  Well, it is really easy to test 90% of the 
cases.  In a straight blade (you do not even pass "bent" ones... now the person
may have straightened a bend, that may be ok if it passes this following test..)
you simply bend the blade with a gentle thrust against an inanimate object
(floor or a wall works) in excess of what a normal thrust would be... an extream
thrust. Release the tension, if the blade holds a bend, it should be discarded.

What this test shows through "dynamic testing" methods is if the metal has
softened/lost its temper.  Blades that have been "over bent" or retain "s"
curves will fail this test in most cases.

You may notice mundane fencers "jabbing" the blade into the floor after they 
straighten one, this is why...

Message-Id: <10245@agate.BERKELEY.EDU>

(My appologies if this has already been sent to the outside world.  I'm
getting a wide variety of returned mail messages that seem to indicate
nothing's going out.)

My lords and ladies, I feel I must strongly protest Lord Benicoeur's 
suggestion that we restrict our discussions in alt.sca.  The Society
is not a secret organization, and whatever "dirty laundry" we might
have is almost certainly of no interest to anyone who doesn't follow
SCA politics.  My Lord Benicoeur, you seemed to suggest that the discussion
concerning paganism and the Society would be inappropriate for an open
environment.  How can you justify this?  Obviously, paganism is a part
of the SCA.  Is this something that you feel we need to be ashamed of,
and should attempt to conceal from anyone not a part of the Society?
And what else should we attempt to hide?

I just cannot see any circumstances where censorship is justified.  I
can think of many instances where it can be destructive.  The Society
is supposed to be a place where we don't have to deal with the mundane
world, a place where people respect each other and each other's
judgements, and where we don't have to worry about what people are
going to say, because we know that they won't try to hurt us or our
friends.  If we think it becomes necessary to censor ourselves, we've
lost these ideals.

The thought of that happening hurts me greatly, my lord.  I haven't
been a member of the Society for a great amount of time (perhaps two
years), and until this weekend I hadn't realized how much the Society
meant to me.  I was faced with a situation where a few people refused
to trust other people, and used methods that I thought were more
appropriate to a kindergarten classroom than an SCA event to
illustrate their mistrust.  If I had been anywhere other than with the
Society, I doubt I would have been bothered significantly.  But it
bothered me greatly, because it destroys all that I hold dear in the
SCA.

Please don't let that happen here.  Think about what you want to say.
Think about how it will affect the Society, both from within and from
without.

Subject: SCA: STATUS: the mailing list, the digest
Message-ID: <384102.880524.DANA0@AI.AI.MIT.EDU>

On Friday the 20th the mailing list SCA@AI was shut down by SCA system
management after it overloaded AI and its mailer COMSAT.  The mailing 
lists moderator had already been working on alternate distribution meathods
to avoid this problem in the future.  Some users may not like what has been
done.  Recognise that if these changes were not made SCA@AI would not have 
every come back on line.

The changes and the problems the arose from these changes are as follows:

FIRST:

	SCA distribution is now out of SCA@MC.AI.MIT.EDU.

All mail for sca distribution should be sent to SCA.MC.AI.MIT.EDU.  Simularly,
all mail to its moderator should be sent to SCA-REQUEST@MC.AI.MIT.EDU.  Mail
sent to AI.AI.MIT.EDU will work, but is simply routed to MC.

SECOND:

	ALT.SCA newsgroup is gatewayed to and from SCA@MC.

Therefore, ALL USERS who can read ALT.SCA should inform the moderator (at 
SCA-REQUEST) so that he may remove them from the distribution list.

THIRD:

	SCA@MC supports DIGESTION.

To reduce mailer overhead mail is now digested. BY DEFAULT users of SCA@MC will
receive their mail in digest form.  IF YOU WILL DIE receiving it in that form
(billboards, gateways and redistribution points are examples of those who might
die) then inform me.  I can provide UNDIGESTED/RAW mailings as was done 
earlier.  Please think before requesting this.  I cannot support more than
fifty undigested distribution sites.

--------
PROBLEMS:

Your moderator cannot type... he typed a "U" instead of a "V" and Digest #1 and
the majority of mail received on Sunday and Monday was lost.  It went to "NULL"
land.

AI had a head crash... this did not help matters.

The mail received Friday, Saterday, and Sunday morning will be digested and 
distributed in digest #3 with the mail received after digest #2.

--------
SOLUTIONS:

The moderator has more time for list maintenance.  Maintenance will be easier.

You will not receive COMSAT and FAILED-MAIL errors nearly as much... and these
errors will go directly to the moderator so that he may QUICKLY deal with the
problem.

Less load on AI lab machines will mean continued existance and support from the
AI lab personel and facilities.

Your mailboxes will not be overstuffed!

	Prescriptive spelling has its origins in the mid- to late 18th
century, really gaining speed during the 19th.  Prior to that it was
descriptive rather than prescriptive, at least as regards to English.

	If it can be shown to have existed in the (loose) period from

This could lead to severe problems.
1)	The concept of fighting for your lady disappears.
2)	The consort may be the king(queen)'s worst enemy.
3)	The consort may be the same sex as the tourney winner.

How about a more radical idea. In the East we have a war king and a winter
king. Keep the war king a king by right of arms as currently done. Since
winter is a time emphasizing Arts and Sciences, have the winter king elected
by the attendees of an Arts/Sciences contest, limiting the slate to winners
of any individual category.

This omits the Order of the Pelican from an easy shot at crown but maybe we
can invent some criteria for allowing dedicated workers a place on the slate.
Maybe anyone who stepped down from a term of office lasting more than 12
months sometime during the previous 18 months.

However, as I said earlier, the East is too big to allow deserving candidates
a fair shot at the crown. I would like to see the East dissolve into a bunch
small kingdoms where some of these ideas could be worked out. The celtic idea
of having minor kings oweing allegiance to a High King might work. The main
purpose of the high king would be to keep the minor kingdoms working to the
same standards and to lead the nation in times of war.

====================================

             Life in the Current Middle Ages
             _______________________________
 
SCA is the Society for Creative Anachronism, which is a group
dedicated to recreating the Middle Ages in the present. Many
groups meet weekly, and at these meetings we dance, talk, study,
learn, revel, and make plans. But first, let's get a little bit
of info about the SCA in general.
 
              Where did the SCA come from?
              ___________________________
 
 The avowed purpose of the SCA is the study and recreation of the
 Middle Ages, its crafts, sciences, arts, traditions, literature,
 etc. The SCA "period" is defined to be 600 AD to 1600 AD. Under
 the aegis of the SCA we study dance, calligraphy, martial arts,
 cooking, metalwork, stained glass, costuming, literature....
 well, if they did it, somebody in the SCA does it (Except die of
 the Plague!).
 
 As you can probably guess, the thing that separates the SCA from
 a Humanities 101 class is the *active* participation in the
 learning process. To learn costuming, you design and build
 costumes. To learn SCA infantry fighting, you make armor,
 weapons, shields, etc., and put them on and go learn how it
 feels to wear them when somebody is swinging a (rattan) sword at
 you. To learn brewing, you make (and sample!) your own wines,
 meads and beers.
 
 You will frequently hear a SCA person describe the SCA as
 recreating the Middle Ages "as they ought to have been." In some
 ways this is true -- we have few plagues, indoor plumbing, few
 peasants. In the dead of winter we have other things to eat than
 King's venison, salt pork and dried tubers.
 
 The SCA was invented (? discovered? begun?) in 1966 in Berkeley,
 California by a group of Science Fiction and Fantasy fans who
 wanted a "theme" party. Following the party, a group got
 together to discuss the idea of a medieval re-creation and
 re-enactment group. (which has ended up being much like the
 Civil War, Revolutionary War or Buckskinning re-enactment groups
 that were beginning to form in the US.) In Britain Medieval and
 British Civil War recreation societies had existed for any
 number of years. The Californians incorporated as a non-profit
 educational society, started forming groups, and away they went.
 
 Since 1966, the society has grown to include nearly 13,000
 paying members in the US, Canada, Mexico, Great Britain,
 Germany, Italy, France, Korea, Okinawa, New Zealand, Australia
 and Greenland. Current demographic estimates indicate that for
 every dues-paying member there are 4 non-subscribing members
 active in local groups.
 
               How is the SCA Organized?
               ________________________
 
 The SCA is a feudal society. No democracies for us! The SCA
 "Knowne World" is divided into twelve Kingdoms, each with a King
 and Queen (who rule by right of arms), a Prince and Princess
 (heirs to the throne), and a council or Curia of Great Officers
 who handle the mundane, day to day details of running the
 kingdom.
 
 A feudal society takes its form from the idea of honor and duty.
 A noble owes duty of service to his lord, a Baron or Knight.
 Knights owe in return the duty of protection from danger and
 food, money, etc. when times are bad.
 
 On the next level up, the Knights owe fealty (the word that
 encompasses this idea of reciprocal responsibilities) to the
 King. In return for their service as good stewards of the land
 and readily available warriors, the King owes the Knights and
 barons protection, honor, and a return of money, food, etc in
 times of hardship. It is something like the idea of a Pyramid
 club, but the benefits are greater and the idea of personal
 honor and mutual responsibility, not profit, tie the structure
 together (or at least it did in Europe for nearly a thousand
 years).
 
 In the SCA this structure underlies our Society, although not
 nearly as rigidly as in the medieval days. Our King, the head of
 our Kingdom and our liege lord, has fought for the right to bear
 the crown by fighting in a Crown Tourney for the right to make
 his Lady Queen. <In the case of female fighters, she has fought
 for the right to make her Lord King Consort.> In some Kingdoms,
 like the West (middle California), the King's word is law, and
 the people willingly obey his every whim. Of course, four months
 later there is a new King, with different ideas. Life can get
 interesting.
 
 Fighting in the SCA, or Why are those people hitting each other?
 _______________________________________________________________
 
 Fighting in the SCA evolved from what happened when two armed
 knights were unhorsed and had to fight on the ground. It
 resembles nothing so much as medieval infantry fighting. There
 are two basic types of SCA fights: single combat, and group or
 team battles, known as melees. SCA fighting does have rules. The
 first, and most important rule, is that each and every fighter
 on the field has honor. The fighter keeps faith with his honor
 by accepting blows that would be killing or wounding (more about
 this a little later).
 
 The second is like unto it; A fighter keeps faith with his
 brother fighters by acknowledging his opponent's word -- if he
 says it was light, it was light. Since we prefer that no one get
 hurt, SCA fighting is done with real armor (made with leather,
 metal, padding, kydex, etc) and rattan swords. Rattan is that
 bamboo-y stuff, only with a solid core, that furniture is made
 of. Rattan, surprisingly enough, is springy enough to absorb
 some of the force of the blow (although blows are *real solid*)
 and light enough to approximate a real steel sword. Swords are
 made by wrapping rattan staffs with strapping tape, covering
 them with duct tape (known as silver tape) for esthetic reasons,
 and attaching some sort of hilt or handle. Armor is much more
 complex -- some armor, being made of steel, rivets, leather,
 etc, can take more than 40 hours per piece of armor (for
 example, a armored "glove" with moving fingers and joints can
 take upwards of 75 hours to complete).
 
 There are several essential and required pieces of armor --
 helm, neck and cervical vertebrae protection, elbows and knees,
 kidneys, hands, groin. After that, most SCA fighters wear chest,
 leg, arm and forearm, and feet protection.
 
 If a blow hits hard enough that a sword would have cloven mail,
 it is "good". Beginning fighters, as they are being trained, are
 taught blow calibrations. Fighters are trained, by the way.
 Aspiring fighters attend some months of fighter practices where
 they learn the rules and learn how to protect themselves on the
 field. After some time, they attempt to "authorize" -- they go
 before a panel of experienced fighters, fight a couple of
 rounds, and if the panel decides the fighter is safe (not good,
 you understand, but unlikely to hurt him or herself or an
 opponent) they are authorized to fight in Tourneys. This process
 (from starting to fight to being authorized) can take from a
 couple of months to a year or more.
 
 Fighting brings us to *the Chivalry.* The Chivalry is a group of
 elite fighters -- those who have gotten very very good at
 fighting, and who at the same time have absorbed the concepts of
 Honor and Chivalry (they're basically good guys), have learned
 something of basic Heraldry, Chess, something about the Arts and
 Sciences, can behave well in public, and are generally good
 examples for people everywhere.
 
 (The word Chivalry comes from the Old French *chevalerie*
 <related to the Spanish *caballeria*>, meaning horse-fighter,
 cavalry, "knight". It came to French and Spanish from Latin
 caballerius, horse rider. As only the wealthy could afford the
 horse and trappings of a mounted warrior, it became the province
 of the nobles to be mounted and fighters. Thus the elite status.
 The word has come down to us from a different route as
 *cavalry*. Oh, well!) <There are rank-equivalents to Knights in
 the Arts and Sciences, called "Laurels", and in the Services,
 called "Pelicans". I will discuss them later on!>
 
 A King (if he is himself a Knight, and not all Kings are) can
 knight a fighter if he (or she) thinks the candidate is
 deserving. Usually the other Chivalry have agreed, or it doesn't
 happen. (If the King isn't a Knight, another member of the
 Chivalry can hold the sword with the King. Only a Knight can
 make a Knight.) The Knights swear personal fealty to the Crown.
 Since some people, for religious reasons, reasons of personal
 honor, etc, feel that swearing fealty is inappropriate for them,
 a branch of Chivalry has been created, called Masters, who do
 not have to swear fealty. Upon receiving the accolade of
 Knighthood, the candidate receives a Gold chain to wear about
 the neck, a white belt, and gold spurs. Some receive a *real*
 sword, as well.
 
       Why Do you all have such funny names?
       _____________________________________
 
 Every person in the SCA picks a name to use in the Society. It
 could be something simple (George of Wardcliff) or something
 elaborate (Dughall Aislean nic mac Lathurna). Most people pick a
 time period in the SCA "period" (between 600 and 1600) and a
 country (any place that can documentably be proven to have had
 trade with western Europe during the period), and choose a name
 from that. Some people just pick a name and forget about it;
 some have elaborate persona stories to go with their names.
 
 Even our towns have new names. Lansing, MI, is Northwoods,
 Toronto is Septentria, Boston is Carolingia, the San Francisco
 bay area is the Principality of the Mists, etc.
 
 Most folk in the SCA register their names and a heraldic device
 that they design to represent them. Also, later in their SCA
 careers, they may be given awards and rank, at which time their
 devices become "Arms" and they are most properly called "Lord"
 or "Lady So-and-So."
 
 Rank in the SCA, or How Come She is Wearing a Crown?
 ____________________________________________________
 
 There are two sorts of peers in the SCA; Royal Peers and Peers.
 Royal Peers are folk who have worn the crown of a Kingdom or
 Principality at least once. Ex-Princes are Viscounts,
 Ex-Princesses Viscountesses, and from there it gets complex.
 Those who have been King or Queen once are Counts/Countesses.
 Those who have been King or Queen twice are Dukes/Duchesses.
 Those who have been King or Queen more than that are generally
 considered masochistic! (Small in-joke!) Seriously, there are
 many who have reigned at least three times, and in the West
 there is a legendary Duke who has been King eight times.
 
 Other sorts of Peers are folk who, through dint of talent, hard
 work, and long effort, are recognized for their contributions
 and skills. We have already talked about the Knights. There are
 also the Laurels (Talented craftsmen and artists, recognized for
 having talents and being willing to teach and be gracious), and
 the Pelicans (generally skilled bureaucrats -- somebody *has* to
 do the hard paperwork of running a Kingdom with 3000 people in
 it, and some people keep working at this sort of task for
 years.). The Pelican was thought in medieval times to be the
 most self-sacrificing animal -- it was thought a Pelican would
 pierce her beast to allow her heart's blood to drip into the
 mouths of her offspring when food was short. Peers are made by
 the desire of the King and Queen in accordance with the
 recommendations of the rest of the order.
 
          Feasting, Dancing and Merrymaking
          ________________________________
 
 One of the most interesting parts of the SCA is the Events --
 the times when we put on our costumes, go out and dance those
 dances we've been practicing, flirt, eat, talk, and generally
 party. Events are held almost every weekend of the year
 somewhere in the country. Most groups hold at least one event
 per year; some larger groups will hold two or more.
 
 At events there are often tourneys, art exhibits or
 competitions, dance classes, workshops, and, later in the
 evening, Royal or Baronial Court, and dancing. Many times there
 will be a Feast in the evening. Other times, for smaller events
 or if a newer group is holding the event, there will be a
 dessert revel (People go out for dinner and then come back for a
 dessert buffet).
 
 The events are the most fun to most folk, because you get to go
 and show off all the things you have been learning in the past
 few months.
 
          What Kind of Person Joins the SCA?
          __________________________________
 
 SCA folk tend to be people like you and me -- just plain folks,
 but people who enjoy doing something more with their weekends. A
 high percentage of SCA members are involved in high tech fields
 -- Computers, Aerospace, high energy physics, etc. This has been
 attributed to the fact that people who play all week with highly
 complex, modern technology find it highly relaxing to spend
 their leisure time working with a different kind of technology,
 in a less modern setting. There are lots of people in all fields
 in the SCA -- historians, writers, secretaries, law enforcement
 personnel, teachers, programmers, insurance agents -- the appeal
 of the SCA is widespread.
 
 A housemate of a SCA person recently said: "From what I can tell
 about these wild and crazy SCA people, they do more than just
 this fighting thing. They really like to make and wear the
 medieval clothes (garb), eat the medieval food, dance the
 medieval dances to the medieval music, maybe even make their own
 medieval music, and other medieval party type activities. They
 also seem to like to be medieval so they can relax and have a
 good time. They are quite willing to talk about SCA or invite
 you to the SCA stuff or whatever."
 
               How You Can Get Involved
               _______________________
 
 We welcome you to our local meetings and our events. You needn't
 join the SCA, Inc, to attend and participate (although if you
 decide to be with us regularly you may wish to join). The only
 requirement to come to an event is that you make some attempt at
 pre-1600 costume -- and most groups have "loaner" costumes for
 people who want to come to their first event.
 
 If you want more information about groups near you, you can call
 our corporate office in Milpitas, CA, at (408) 262-5250, or send

The SCA is a lot like the outside world when it comes to piping - some
people love it, some people just don't have any taste and can't stand
it :-).  I've been told a story (several times) about a king out here
in the West who really liked pipes, and asked a piper to play for the
entire encampment.  At eight in the morning.  Now, I love pipes and
pipe music (after seven years playing with a mundane pipe band, I'd
better love it :-)), but I would cheerfully help to quiet any piper
playing at such an hour, hopefully by tossing him/her in the local
lake.  My point (bet you didn't think I had one) is that for some
reason, bad pipers love to play at truely godforsaken times and
perpetuate the myth that pipes are an awful instrument.  By all means,
tell your friend to bring his pipes, and let the populace hear what a
good piper can sound like.

Subject: sca: the mailing list and the digest status (corrected)
Message-ID: <384121.880524.DANA@AI.AI.MIT.EDU>

On Friday the 20th the mailing list SCA@AI was shut down by SCA system
management after it overloaded AI and its mailer COMSAT.  The mailing 
lists moderator had already been working on alternate distribution meathods
to avoid this problem in the future.  Some users may not like what has been
done.  Recognise that if these changes were not made SCA@AI would not have 
every come back on line.

The changes and the problems the arose from these changes are as follows:

FIRST:

	SCA distribution is now out of SCA@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU.

All mail for sca distribution should be sent to SCA.MC.LCS.MIT.EDU.  Simularly,
all mail to its moderator should be sent to SCA-REQUEST@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU.  Mail
sent to AI.AI.MIT.EDU will work, but is simply routed to MC.

SECOND:

	ALT.SCA newsgroup is gatewayed to and from SCA@MC.

Therefore, ALL USERS who can read ALT.SCA should inform the moderator (at 
SCA-REQUEST) so that he may remove them from the distribution list.

THIRD:

	SCA@MC supports DIGESTION.

To reduce mailer overhead mail is now digested. BY DEFAULT users of SCA@MC will
receive their mail in digest form.  IF YOU WILL DIE receiving it in that form
(billboards, gateways and redistribution points are examples of those who might
die) then inform me.  I can provide UNDIGESTED/RAW mailings as was done 
earlier.  Please think before requesting this.  I cannot support more than
fifty undigested distribution sites.

--------
PROBLEMS:

Your moderator cannot type... he typed a "U" instead of a "V" and Digest #1 and
the majority of mail received on Sunday and Monday was lost.  It went to "NULL"
land.

AI had a head crash... this did not help matters.

The mail received Friday, Saterday, and Sunday morning will be digested and 
distributed in digest #3 with the mail received after digest #2.

--------
SOLUTIONS:

The moderator has more time for list maintenance.  Maintenance will be easier.

You will not receive COMSAT and FAILED-MAIL errors nearly as much... and these
errors will go directly to the moderator so that he may QUICKLY deal with the
problem.

Less load on AI lab machines will mean continued existance and support from the
AI lab personel and facilities.

Your mailboxes will not be overstuffed!

	With all due respect, _BIRD BLEEP_.

	_ALL_ of the original fighters in the Society were fencers, wearing
very slightly reinforced mundane fencing gear.  Rattan came along somewhere in
the first year, tentatively and experimentally.  It was only in A.S. 5 or so
that it became obligatory, and fencing was outlawed.

Subject:  Fencing


The normal test we use on fencing blades is to deliberately bend it,
say by thrusting against the floor, and then to see if it holds a
bend.  This of course will not find all blades before they break, but
it does tend to get blades which show obvious signs of metal fatigue
out of circulation.  As with all sports, we can't make fencing 100%
safe, we can only try to eliminate the accidents that could have been
avoided.  After all, even crossing the street is a risky proposition
these days.

PROBLEMS:

Your moderator cannot type... he typed a "U" instead of a "V" and Digest #1 and
the majority of mail received on Sunday and Monday was lost.  It went to "NULL"

SOLUTIONS:

The moderator has more time for list maintenance.  Maintenance will be easier.

You will not receive COMSAT and FAILED-MAIL errors nearly as much... and these

Message-Id: <8WYrQny00XcNyJY0Ao@andrew.cmu.edu>

I am Jas Clarion, Master of Fence for the BMDL
(Barony Marche of the Debatable Lands - Pittsburgh).

I cannot more heartily applaud Elektra's post on fencing.
I fence both mundanely and in the Society and I too (as well as others
 here) have noticed the rising calibration levels in fencing in the Society.

In fact an interesting situation occured during a bout at a tourney in the
BMDL, where an un-named (and un-local, but highly placed) marshal
observed his student bearing an epee and facing one of our newer fencers,
who was using a foil.  After the bout when the student noted that all she
could feel were "slappy slappy things" the marshal said
"Yeah, at the next rules-meeting we are going to have to get around to banning
foils.  With all the armor we are wearing now days you just can't feel 'em."

I was rather appalled by this comment and also rather scared...
Currently I think our (BMDL) fencers have the lowest calibration in the East
(with possible exceptions on the East coast where I haven't had the chance
 to fence much).  Where are we going???
Are we fated to go down the same path as heavy-weapons????
I have also fought rattan, and I will again in the BMDL - with people I know.
However I KNOW that I don't want to get hit with blows that I have often
seen called light in rattan combat.

P.S. I can add one fatal fencing story... I heard that (also I think at a high
level
-World champs???-  meet a foil fencer was fatally impaled with a broken (#2)
blade.  This was quite awhile ago.  So that makes three serious incidences.
I have heard of many, many more in professional sports (football...racing....
crossing the street...getting out of the bathtub...walking home through South

Message-Id: <21683@amdcad.AMD.COM>

Well, I am 6'2" and only 150 lbs. (can we say
skinny?) and I'm not sure I see as much problem
as the rest of you. I have been fighting off and
on for about 5 years starting in Atenveldt and
now Ansteorra. I use essentially the same armor
as when I started except now I have leather legs 
instead of metal (!!). Yes I occasionally run into
the heavy hitter who scares me but I just try not
to fight him/her if I can avoid it. This is only 
possible during training and things like melees but
that is a start. I think armor will eventually reach 
the opportunites for injury will require an advance 
in weaponry or someone outon the field trying really 
hard. In other words arms  escalations (which we are
seeing in microcosm) requires continuing advances on
both the offensive and defensive sides to remain an
escalation. With the strict control of weapons (when
was the last time there was a fundamental change in 
the basic rattan sword with a basket hilt) offensive
advances will only come from the fighter wielding
the weapons. What I am trying to say is that if you had
frozen weapons advances in the middle ages at broadswords
(i.e. no maces, great swords, etc. etc.) would plate
armor have come into being? Fighting in the "Good old
days" with maybe elbow pads a cup and a helmet seems
silly when the other person is carrying essentially a
baseball bat. Now that offense and defense are at a bit
of equilibrium and one stays the same, the arms race should
slow way down. In summary (about time) I haven't seen
anything other than minor advances in 5 years and don't
see much other than small rule changes for a while. This
is to me an indicator that we have reached a staus quo
of some sort.

First, there is no way to get everyone using the same force every time.  The
same fighter in the same bout will hit people differently.  I have hit people
with what I thought was a light blow and gotten complaints; sometimes what I
thought were heavy blows were considered light by people whose judgement I
trust.

Secondly, we cannot allow blow forces to escalate.  In the Middle we currently
use "active marshalling" - a marshall can call a fighter dead if there are
repeated failures on the part of the fighter.  It is a judgement call, and
should be done very carefully - but if someone is consistently failing to
block a blow and refuses to accept it, then it's time to at least discuss
it.  I don't buy the argument that active marshalling compromises a fighter's
honor; failing to acknowledge blows is a much more serious problem, and
a fighter should be happy to find out that there are questions.

Finally, I got started in the S.C.A. as a dancer but eventually moved to
SCA fighting.  Dancing was more dangerous; I have  never been seriously
hurt fighting but I have suffered near heat stroke, injured ligaments,
cuts, etc., from dancing.  Most of these occurred at demos - here's your

Subject: On the choosing of monarchs

First off, some historical facts.

1.  Tournaments, as we know them and recreate them in the SCA, are a 
RENAISSANCE phenomenon, *not* a medieval one.

2.  MOST of our cooking, ALL of our dancing (the earliest dance manuals extant
date from the mid-1400's), and a large chunk of our heraldy and costuming as
seen in the SCA, is RENAISSANCE, *not* medieval.

Considering these facts, and considering the fact that these are the activities
we see the most of in the SCA, how can anyone claim that we are PRIMARILY
a medieval re-creation society?

The BOD notwitstanding, if you go out to the West, you're going to find a lot
of fighters in full, 16th century plate armour.  And if you're in the east,
you are far more likely to find the nobility attending court in Renaissance
garb than you are in medieval garb.  And EVERYWHERE, if they're dancing, they're
doing Renaissance dance.  And probably eating food prepared from Renaissance
cookbooks (since they are the most readily available period sources).

So it's plain silly to claim that we're a primarily medieval recreation 
society.  The simple fact that fencing IS so popular and growing very 
rapidly should make it clear that the Renaissance is a large part of what
we do.

Also, I don't know how anyone can claim that an Arts competition would be
anymore disputable than a heavy-list crown tourney.  Or have you forgotten
the Crown Tourney which placed Gavin I on the eastern throne, which 
caused such controversy that the kingdom was nearly torn apart, and we ended
up with a very large splinter group which, to this day, still bears great
animosity towards the East?  All of this because a finalist in the lists
got called for rhinohiding?

And as for fairness... I have attended 5 or 6 crown torneys, and I have seen
obvious rhinohiding in all but two of them -- and one of them the King felt
bound to warn the fighters that anyone caught rhinohiding would be banned
from the lists for a YEAR!  Fortunately, the rhinohiders never made it to the
finals, but, still, I have heard many stories of people who won crowns
simply because their threshold to pain was higher than anyone else's.

We in the East have had considerable problem with "stick jock" kings -- 
kings who refuse to do their paperwork, do things against the near
unanimous advice of their Curia and polling orders, and start problems which
have taken 3 or 4 reigns afterward to straighten out.

Our present systems is not perfect -- changing it could make it better or 
worse.  

However, if we don't try to change it, we'll NEVER be able to improve it.

Since we have two Kings per year, I'd like to see the system split into
two DIFFERENT crown tourneys.  I'd like to keep the present system for the
selection of the Summer King, since he must be our Commander at the Pennsic
Wars.  Someone who is a good heavylist fighter and is well-known within
the heavy lists will have a better chance of being a strong War King than
a fencer or artists.

However, I'd like to see the Winter King, who has no martial duties and is
more of a courtier than a warrior, be selected by another method -- perhaps
a fencing tourney (since very few people CANNOT fence, if they wish --
it does not require physical strength or a tolerance to pain and bruising,
but rather skill that any may learn) coupled with a competition in dance
and other arts -- chess and heraldry and extemporaneous oratory perhaps.

After all, sometimes the King ended up being he who was best able to 
OUT-THINK his oponents -- not outfight them!

Is this different from the blow inflation that you seem to be experiencing?  
Unless you are a Borgia, the politics over arts judging have to be less 
dangerous than the Crown Tourney, which (just from reading here...) seems to 
encourage cheating (denying blows), dishonorable conduct ("striking to maim" 
in friendly competition), and kings who are "slime and scum and unfit to wipe
your shoes on."  Certainly it is much more period to have the kingship in 
question due to politics, than to have a king who is proven in the lists but 
not:
			as a strategist
			as a politician
			as a diplomat (such as things existed before my
						time {1450+ Florence})
			as a courtier in general
			as a good (at least competant) lord respected 
						by his vassals

This last includes such qualities as being known to be loyal and reasonably 
generous to those who serve him, and ideally would include a certain amount of 
Solomon's wisdom.  But you probably can't ask for too much. :-)

Unless he is a GOOD king, of the sort who understands the reasonableness of 
the banks and the exchequer...

In this, I beg that I might clarify.  It is not the fairness that makes it

that requires no discretion from the observer.  "Fairness" is a fiction based
on mutual respect by opponents.  I do not believe that you are involving the

Greetings;
   Anarchy does not lie in Arts competitions.  And perhaps an arts competition
can never be judged fairly, but fighting isn't always fair either, especially
when crown is at stake.  Calibration goes way up when it comes to crown, and
calibration differs from person to person.  Yes, the king definitely wins
crown tourney, but this isn't neccessarily any fairer than an arts competion
just because it is more definite.
   Why cannot an arts competition be judged fairly by qualified personnel
(meaning those who have shown exceptional ability in doing what they are to
judge)?  If names are left off of entries then there should be no bias
when it comes to judging arts.  Have an odd number of judges, maybe even
one or two who don't know what they are really doing, but who can judge such
things as good workmanship (as opposed to authenticity).  Find a new
person or two who is not yet involved in politics to judge.  It seems that
measures can be taken to ensure a fair contest.
  With this I leave you for a couple of months, hope to chat next autumn.

Subject: Loaner Armour

Good day;
   The Dominion of Myrkfaelinn has a large supply of armour which is loaned
out to new fighters.  Since we are located on the campus of a major
university we often get several new fighters each semester.  By having a
closet full of loaner stuff, these prospective fighters may try fighting
before they must invest time and money for their own armour.  The loaner
armour policy says that if a fighter wishes to continue fighting they
may use the loaner armour so long as it is unneeded by a newer member.
Older members are expected to acquire personal armour.
   This system seems to work well, but I must say that we also have a full
time armourer in the group who often does repairs to keep the loaner
stuff in good, safe condition.  The armour has come from various sources:
cast-off stuff as fighters get new gear, lost/found unclaimed bits and
pices, armour created specifically for loaner purpose, stuff left behind
by former group members who are no longer active, etc.
   The best thing about loaner armour is that one need not jump into a
large investment before knowing whther to make a commitment.  We have
several helms with various amounts of padding, a very large box of hockey
gloves picked up at yard sales, sevarl gorgets and elbow cops, about 8
sets of metal leg armour, shields, weapons, and sets of carpet body armour, and
two metal coats of plates.
   It seems to be worth any group getting some loaner armour through a purchase
or a workshop.  This semester we did a carpet armour workshop and produced
several set of body armour -- the carpet came from the steps of a frat house
which had discarded it, so the only cost was two evening's worth of work by
maybe 8-12 people.

Subject: Crocks

Whereas I have been called upon to substantiate the statements made
in my last posting, I have collected the True Scoop on this matter,
and will elucidate:  I got this from Sir Eric, who got it straight from
the Baron of LionsGate in AnTir.  The insurance company in question is 
Canadian, and a policy was purchased to cover SCA fighting in Canada
(how much of Canada I don't know, but certainly all of Canadian AnTir).
The insurance company asked many questions about our sport, as
insurance companies are wont to do.  These included the numbers of
people participating, the injuries *commonly* received, and how often
these sorts of injuries are received.  Canadian sports insurance 
recognizes four categories of danger or risk in sports.  The first is 
chess, board games, etc. where risk is very low.  The second group 
includes curling, golf, and such sports where injuries exist but are 
uncommon(this is where the ping pong came in).  the third group includes
such sports as basketball, baseball, and football, where injuries are
relatively common and deaths are not unheard of.  The fourth group 
includes skydiving, shark-wrestling:-) and sports which are considered 
quite hazardous.  I apologize if my posting made SCA fighting seem 
harmless, but it IS (in my kingdom anyway) safe.  If the lord, Eduardo,
is typical, the day fast approaches when we will be mourning a fighter
who has lost his life in the list.  If these injuries are more commonly
given by many fighters who hit harder than Eduardo does, I am not 
going to drive 3000 miles to Pennsic to get turned into hamburger.  
There are stickjocks who want people to think that rattan fighting is 
a macho thing for macho people.  Where I come from, this is not the
case.  I may have eight bruises on one thigh, but not any broken bones.
Calibration is one of the things in which kingdoms may vary widely, and
I would like to hear from other Easterners (fighters or not, injuries
are usually talked about) about the frequency of injuries there.  The 
VAST majority of Western fighters have neither had this type of injury 
nor inflicted it upon others.  I think that most fighters agree that 
"light, clean" blows will make a solid impact, but not break, fracture,
or dislocate people.  

Apologies for the long insurance spiel, but I felt that my word had 
been called into question and that I must elucidate.

Im not sure where you are from; that is the one problem with this medium.
From what you said, I assume you are in the West, or at least have most of
your experience there. In recent years, it has been noticed locally that
becoming a knight is in many ways a popularity contest. I have overheard a
pair of white-belts talking, one saying to the other "No, he shouldnt
become a knight, I dont like him. He doesnt show proper respect to me." By
the tone of voice, this was serious and not sarcastic. This was at a
Pennsic, I was close enough to the battle line to hear a pair of marshalls
talking during a hold. I am reasonably sure (based on their garb) that they
were Easterners. A few Pennsics ago (2 I believe), a knight who moved here
from AnTir, who I know as Fast Eddie and can never remember the rest of his
name, brought some of his squires up before the king and made a point to
mention that his squires knew Dances (they demonstrated), needlepoint (for
the Arts), and a few of them even had real chess ratings. The rest of the
Chivalry looked sort of sheepish. The rules state "must have knowledge of",
they dont state that the Chivalry must "know" dance or chess or anything
besides how to fight. I know lots of knights who sound as if they are
boasting when they claim they dont know how to dance. The largest local
fighting household only shows up at events for the tourneys. The only time
I see them at events otherwise they usually say "Yeah, I had to come to
something besides a fighting event in order to compete in crown." 
 
Specifically, it has been said by a few fighters in our local group, that
to get offered a white belt one has to be in the right household.  I have
*never* seen an unafilliated fighter, no matter *how* good, become a knight
OR a master. There are two local fighting households. *Both* of them rather
routinely bruise novices such that they cant fight for a week or so. This
has the side (?) effect of making them unable to fight at regular baronial
practice. 

Ideally, the Chivalry are the people to go to in order to *solve* problems
like this. So what do you do when the Chivalry *are* the problem?

I dont know if it matters. On the plus side, it means higher signal
(message) to noise (headers) ratio. On the other hand, it makes it more
difficult to follow a single discussion thread.


As for mailing list vs newsgroups, what is more likely to be noticed: one
more newsgroup out of thousands, or one person's suddenly blossoming mail
file, taking up space that is *directly attributable* to *one* person?

Not even a mailing list is private, Arval. If you learn one lesson from
your stay at Rutgers, learn this: There Is No Privacy On The Net. Not in
mail, not in news, not even in your home directory. There are just too many
loopholes in the transfer system. Fixing most of them would entail such a
huge rewrite that it will never get done. And as long as there are assholes
on the net, there will be people with the priveleges to do so reading other
people's mail. (read this as: it wont change)


Besides, if it is in one group only, it is dirty laundry. If it is a
Society-wide occurrence, then it is an epidemic and something should be
done about it. And the only way to find out is to talk about it.

The usual explination that I give is something like this:

Winston Churchill once said that "democracy is the worst form of
government -- except for all the others".  The SCA provides a
demonstration of this.  The SCA is the only organization that I know of
that makes absolutely no pretense of being democratic.  Note that
autocracy is *far* more period than any form of democracy.  It adds a
definate flavor of its own.  Of course, you may not like it ...

Here in the fair Barony of Storvik, one of the things that helps keep us
honest (so to speak :-) is the presence of another medievalst group, the
Markland Mercinary Militia.  With them, you can have any title you want
(assuming it's not already in use) for $25 per year.  It's one of their
main sources of income.  Is that what you want?  The way to get an SCA
title (in theory :-( - see the politics discussion) is to earn it.

We've tried variations on this, albeit with very light bags.  It turns out to
be a nontrivial problem to set it up so that it keeps swinging (as opposed to
barely quivering) for a reasonable length of time -- such as the time it takes
the swinger to get back behind the firing line.  Also,, the elegance of the
solution disappears after the first arrow penetrates.  I'm not sure how much a

Wonderful!!  There's a good deal of music around, but never enough.  As to what
kind, it depends on the circumstances.  During an official sca function or
event there is a strong preference that the music or song be period (or a
reasonable facsimile).  In more relaxed circumstances, such as campfires or
parties (e.g. post revels) this gets relaxed a good deal, particularly in the
direction of folk and filk, but the jarringly modern should be avoided.  As for
choice of instruments, yours are fine.  Again, only the jarringly modern are
really frowned upon.

Different kinds of events feature different balances between fighting, music,
dance and other activities.  Crown Tourneys, of course, have a moderately heavy
emphasis on fighting.  I don't know if I would have suggested it as a first
event, but I hope you enjoy it and are motivated to attend others.

I don't know how good an idea this would be for a crown tourney, but it has
merit in its own right.  Before it's seriously advanced as a way to select
royalty, I'd be interested in seeing it tested for practicality at an event.
Or, if it already has been tried, I'd be interested in knowing how it came out.

Subject: Clarification on Earlier Message re:  blows and real damage

Having recieved two separate ambiguous replies which lead me to believe that I 
was being ambiguous myself:

Clarification:

The injuries which I described happened in 1978 and 1982.  They are not 
current indications.  I have no idea what the recent injury list in the East 
Kingdom looks like.  I was not a primary advocate of light blows then.  I was 
striking in accordance with the policy of the day.  Repeat:  I nonetheless 
consider all three blows to be unfortunate acccidents after discussing them at 
length with others. It just was one of the reasons I've been converted to 
believing that all good clean blows should be accepted, as the book says.  All 
three incidents also involved people who has previously claimed that I had hit 
them with light or glancing blows.    

I would hope and expect that heavier armor requirements have grown faster than 
heavy blow increases.  This should have resulted in fewer real accidents as
time has gone by.  

By the way, when I WAS fighting, it was my perception that there were many 
more injuries in the Middle and West kingdoms than the East.  

If and When I do make statements that do not apply to current situations, 
please try to correct me (but gently, I'm tender :-), I am a bit out of touch.

	Anyone using an Epee blade like a sabre should slowly roasted over

	Maybe some one should dig up the specs for old-style rapiers and sabres,

This is partially a response to Elektra's comments about injuries in
fencing and a plea for some help.

There have actually been several major injuries including one more
death.  That was; however, caused by an electrical malfunction wherin
a 220 volt line managed to cross the B of a weapon. Grounded on sweat
and the fencer was electrocuted.  That is why all major international
competitions are run using 12Volt batteries to power the scoring boxes
and optoisolation is used for overhead scoring towers.  In the US we
tend to use GFCI isolated circuits to give a margin of safety.

The plea I am making is to watch for old and battered masks.  There
exists a standard test for the strenght of mask mesh and it should be
used.

The test consists of attempting to broach the mesh with a punch of
carefully controlled size and force.  I intend to bring several to the
Pensic War. If you want details or a dealers name please contact me.
I have access to enough punchs so some can be loaned to list folk for 
specific events.

I haven't seen any responses, and I don't have the article, so I 
thought I'd provide my advice.

Although some areas may be set aside for period-style camps, most
people will probably have modern ones. Yours will be perfectly
welcome, Coleman stove and all. Going to a camping event in a
backpacking tent is a crazy-making experience. 

Bring bread, fruit, cheese, and a LOT to drink; minted iced tea
or lemonade is good. That will do you for lunch, and for keeping
from dying of thirst.

You'll want more than one outfit. For the day, your basic T-tunic in a
solid cotton is cheap, easy to make, and comfortable. If you don't
feel comfortable wearing what is basically a dress, you can wear a
short one over dark colored pants - preferably not your blue jeans.
Save the good stuff for the feast. Otherwise you'll feel left out when
everyone else changes. (A hint on material for T-tunics; try quilt shops.
I have the luck to live near a really good one, and they have nearly
a hundred bolts of solid colored cotton and cotton blends. Also some
good border prints to use for trim.)

	Good luck,

Subject: Repost

As requested by Lord Tofi, here is a repost of my original article.


My lords and ladies, I feel I must strongly protest Lord Benicoeur's 
suggestion that we restrict our discussions in alt.sca.  The Society
is not a secret organization, and whatever "dirty laundry" we might
have is almost certainly of no interest to anyone who doesn't follow
SCA politics.  My Lord Benicoeur, you seemed to suggest that the discussion
concerning paganism and the Society would be inappropriate for an open
environment.  How can you justify this?  Obviously, paganism is a part
of the SCA.  Is this something that you feel we need to be ashamed of,
and should attempt to conceal from anyone not a part of the Society?
And what else should we attempt to hide?

I just cannot see any circumstances where censorship is justified.  I
can think of many instances where it can be destructive.  The Society
is supposed to be a place where we don't have to deal with the mundane
world, a place where people respect each other and each other's
judgements, and where we don't have to worry about what people are
going to say, because we know that they won't try to hurt us or our
friends.  If we think it becomes necessary to censor ourselves, we've
lost these ideals.

The thought of that happening hurts me greatly, my lord.  I haven't
been a member of the Society for a great amount of time (perhaps two
years), and until this weekend I hadn't realized how much the Society
meant to me.  I was faced with a situation where a few people refused
to trust other people, and used methods that I thought were more
appropriate to a kindergarten classroom than an SCA event to
illustrate their mistrust.  If I had been anywhere other than with the
Society, I doubt I would have been bothered significantly.  But it
bothered me greatly, because it destroys all that I hold dear in the
SCA.

Please don't let that happen here.  Think about what you want to say.
Think about how it will affect the Society, both from within and from
without.

My interest in fencing was spawned just this past January. While mundane
tournament-style fencing indeed has it's merits, it is, in my opinion, rather
unrealistic of the form being replicated. I prefer the style used in the SCA,
because it is hands-down more realistic. Never, if I am in a swordfight with my
life on the line, am I going to move only forwards and backwards. But on to the
more relevant topics: I am appalled to find it forbidden in the West Kingdom.
Safety indeed. Fencing, if conducted properly, is considerably more safe than
heavy weapons. Fencers are required to have 3-4 layers of trigger over their
bodies. This means full legs and arms, as well as chest and torso. You must
wear a hoodthat fully covers the neck region and spills over to the shoulders.
Over this hood, you wear a fencing mask, similiar to the ones used mundanely,
but these have leather laces in the back to hold them on better. You must wear
a strong glove on each hand, covering to the sleeve of your tunic. And lastly,
you must have boots with enforcedtoe and such, as the foot is also a target.
It is impossible to break a bone with the light blades of foils. You can raise
nasty welts, but nothing compared to the clubs used by others. True, if the
fencing tip (a colored plastic bulb over the blunt tip of the blade) were to
snap, the resulting sharp edge could be harmful. However, if you enforce the
inspection of equipment prior to matches, you can usually prevent this. Also,
an observant marshall can tell when there is no longer a red/green/<your 
favourite bright color> tip to your blade. Believe me, if it were that danger-
ous as a sport, world-wide interest in it would not be so strong (participant-
wise, that is).

From: daver@amdcad.uucp  (Dave Rubin)
Subject: period fencing
Message-Id: <21702@amdcad.AMD.COM>

Here in Ansteorra period fencing is very, very popular.
It has been around for a while then Don Tivar Moondragon
and many others (especially in Austin) codified it and
regulated it. At the last Queen's Champion, which is
the largest light weapons tourney, there were upwards
of 80 fighter I believe. Living about an hour from Austin
which is a real hotbed of period fencing we get a lot of
exposure here. Let me make some comments.

There are minimum and maximum armor requirements. Min is 4
ounce leather or equivalent over the torso. Equivalent is
often four layers of trigger cloth. The test for equivalency
is to punch test the material 4 times with a broken foil and
have no penetration. This is usually done with the material
on the ground. Maximum is as follows (quote from the
Ansteorra rules of the lists) "Any armor that prevents a
duellist from calling a blow or drawcut shall be barred from
use".  Duello is another term for period fencing. To gloss
over the remaining requirements: no bare skin, cup (holes 
plugged), mask, back of head, and armpit protection. These
are more detailed than I put here.
     Only a #5 french foil is used. Epees were used for a while
but have been discontinued (I don't know why). There has
been a lot of research done recently on force of blows 
required including some work with cadavers. The basic 
premise of requiring a blow of sufficient force to make the
blade bend at least 2 inches has been found to be consistant with
real world experiences. Draw cuts are being acknowledged as well.
     Accomplished duellists can become Dons (or Donas ??) which
is the fencing equivalent to a knight. This is not a peerage but
is I believe one tier down. (I know this is a poor way to look
at SCA awards, but....). Dons wear white scarves and may take
cadets who wear red scarves.
     With respect to chivalry, most of the period fencers here
are trying to fight from a question of honor rather than as street
brawlers. Some lists are run where you draw an opponent by random
and there is assumed to be a question of honor between you. At this
point the match is arranged by seconds and the bout is an honorable
(albeit deadly) one. Many fighters will change hands if they hit
your sword hand forcing you to change, and many will go to their
knees if you lose your legs.	
    The major safety question (and really the only one of
significance that I see) is broken blades. I have seen two broken
blades and both times the armor was completely sufficient to stop
the blow. Blades that become kinked or get an 'S' curve are
discarded. As long as masks, throat/neck protection, and torso
armor is well regulated I see very few problems. And this is from
a die-hard heavy fighter who would rather get a broken bone than 
pierced by a foil. However the times I have fenced I have felt
fairly safe.
     The Ansteorran Rapier Marshall is:
	      Don Blayne atteWood the Juggler
	      (James Barnes) (512) 371-0900
Don Tivar, the Society Rapier Marshall, is a good source as well.
Unfortunately I don't have his number handy. The fencers try to make
it to Pennsic every year to 'spread the word' and make Don's from
other places. I assume only a Don can make a Don (or the crown can 
probably do it as well). I will hopefully be attending the Academy
of the Rapier in June which is an Ansteorran event to teach period 
fencing. If I get any good material I will try to condense it to 
the net. Please e-mail me if you want more info, I am new to this
but as K.M. of my barony I am learning and have some good resources
handy.

P.S. Anyone want to comment on Shinai? We do a little here and this
can be an elegant substitue for period fencing if you wish to fight
light but retain the idea of slashing swords instead of thrusting.

Of course, there *was* an incident a few years ago between a Polish
and a Russian fencer (in a Soviet bloc championship, I believe) --

The Pole lunges, hits the Russian's bell guard or somesuch, blade
snaps at the foible, lunge continues (maybe Russian was trying
a stop thrust?) through the Russian's heart. Now this is a
testament to Russian training: Pole jumps back, aghast (well,
hopefully aghast), Russian jumps back, goes on guard, dies.....

But realistically, I must agree that fencing overall must be 
considered safer than SCA fighting. I also agree that foil
fencing is particularly safe -- Once I bruised my thumb, but that's
about the extent of damage I've seen that was actually due to being
hit by an opponent's blade. Of course, saber fencing leads to bruises,
but so does SCA fighting....

This is not true.  Inspecting a blade before its use will not give you
any hints as to whether the blade is about to break or not.  Blade breaks
are almost always completely unexpected.  You cannot *see* metal fatigue
(or whatever failure mode it is that causes fencing blades to break,
anyone out there know?).

Greetings to all!

Since many of the gentle folk who wish to communicate by email are not
able to get this newsgroup, an automated mailing list has been
established by Lord Danulf Donaldson in Carolingia (Boston).  To
subscribe, send email to SCA-REQUEST.ai.ai.mit.edu, with the following
info:

1) SCA & mundane names
2) SCA & mundane locations
3) titles, offices, etc.
4) brief summary of SCA interests
5) email address (ARPANET preferred)
6) Do you want to be added to the mailing list?
7) May your address be given out to other SCAfolk?

Subject: sca: status of the mailing list and digest
To: sca-digest-humans@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU
Message-ID: <384117.880524.DANA@AI.AI.MIT.EDU>

On Friday the 20th the mailing list SCA@AI was shut down by SCA system
management after it overloaded AI and its mailer COMSAT.  The mailing 
lists moderator had already been working on alternate distribution meathods
to avoid this problem in the future.  Some users may not like what has been
done.  Recognise that if these changes were not made SCA@AI would not have 
every come back on line.

The changes and the problems the arose from these changes are as follows:

FIRST:

	SCA distribution is now out of SCA@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU.

All mail for sca distribution should be sent to SCA.MC.LCS.MIT.EDU.  Simularly,
all mail to its moderator should be sent to SCA-REQUEST@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU.  Mail
sent to AI.AI.MIT.EDU will work, but is simply routed to MC.

SECOND:

	ALT.SCA newsgroup is gatewayed to and from SCA@MC.

Therefore, ALL USERS who can read ALT.SCA should inform the moderator (at 
SCA-REQUEST) so that he may remove them from the distribution list.

THIRD:

	SCA@MC supports DIGESTION.

To reduce mailer overhead mail is now digested. BY DEFAULT users of SCA@MC will
receive their mail in digest form.  IF YOU WILL DIE receiving it in that form
(billboards, gateways and redistribution points are examples of those who might
die) then inform me.  I can provide UNDIGESTED/RAW mailings as was done 
earlier.  Please think before requesting this.  I cannot support more than
fifty undigested distribution sites.

--------
PROBLEMS:

Your moderator cannot type... he typed a "U" instead of a "V" and Digest #1 and
the majority of mail received on Sunday and Monday was lost.  It went to "NULL"
land.

AI had a head crash... this did not help matters.

The mail received Friday, Saterday, and Sunday morning will be digested and 
distributed in digest #3 with the mail received after digest #2.

--------
SOLUTIONS:

The moderator has more time for list maintenance.  Maintenance will be easier.

You will not receive COMSAT and FAILED-MAIL errors nearly as much... and these
errors will go directly to the moderator so that he may QUICKLY deal with the
problem.

Less load on AI lab machines will mean continued existance and support from the
AI lab personel and facilities.

Your mailboxes will not be overstuffed!

PROBLEMS?

Contact the Moderator: SCA-REQUEST@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU

I thought a magnetic dust would collect about stress and fatigue points
when a strong magnetinc field was induced in the tested magnetic material,
either with an applied current or magnetic field...

(And if you think I'm going to post this to sci.physics or what ever that's
