     According to the information which I got at the Ritenour Health
Center here at Penn State, trichomonias is a sexually *transmitted*
disease, as opposed to a sexually *transmissible* disease.  It seems
that the distinction is that sexually *transmitted* diseases are not
transmitted in any other way (such as water in the swimming hole).
Therefore, the only way that anyone could have gotten it that involves
the swimming hole would have to involve someone they met there.

There has been a debate "raging" as to proper forms of address and 
"persnickety peers".  

My own lord chooses not to acknowledge his  titles on a general basis
due to not necessarily wishing to have received them.  I believe this is 
well within his rights and within the rights of any gentle in the SCA.
Since each gentle earns those ranks, I believe it is up to the gentle
to determine if he or she chooses to be called by said titles.

Not having any rank of my own as yet within the SCA, I am not entirely sure
if I should be the one commenting on this, however, as I have many friends 
who are peers, I know that people occasionally are not comfortable with their
titles, not being entirely sure that they have earned them.  I say that the
choice is with the person, not with the general populace, who thinks what
they should do to be "proper".

I suggest you go to the nearest major city and check out the Japanese grocery
/general merchandise stores.  For example, I live near San Francisco and San
Jose, and they have a store called Nichi Bei Bussan which has patterns for
kimonos (I got one for a friend of mine).  (I don't know if they have one for
the hakama pants.)  Or look up 'Oriental/Asian stores' in your yellow pages
and give 'em a call.....

The patterns cost something like $10-15, as I recall (it's been a few years
since I got them for her!).

RE: Royal Words:

Thanks to milord Jeremy de Merstone for his detailed and learned
article on the forms of address (FoA) for Kings & other royalty.

Of course you are correct that anything which occurred during the
reign of Henry VIII is well within the SCA "period". And please don't
think that I'm one of those people who go around pointing and saying
"that's not period". I may be a purist, but I try very hard not to
become a besserwisser (German word for someone who thinks he knows
everything). What I was getting at was "period" for the people in-
volved; what if I'm an early Norman and the King is a late 16th
century fop? Should I speak to him as my persona would speak to his
King, or should I adopt the usage of his period?

Anyway, all this may be irrelevant now, since it seems that my
question was based on wrong information. My dictionaries are obvi-
ously in error when they say that "majesty" was not used as a FoA
for Kings before Henry VIII. The source you quote (Oxford English
Dictionary) seems more trustworthy. I thank you for the correction,
and hope that my question hasn't contributed to spreading any dis-
information.

My, limited, understanding of the guilds is that there were no intervening
ranks.

The way it worked was that a master could take apprentices. He might pay or
be paid to take the individual as his apprentice. The apprentice would have
all of his needs provided for by his master for the length of the 
apprenticeship. He could earn no money for himself, only for his master.
At the end of his apprenticeship he was, 'de facto' a journeyman. He could
practice his craft for his own benefit. He could work for any master who
would have  him. The intent, I believe, was that the journeyman could
travel across the country working for a variety of masters finishing his
education in the various arts of his craft. At some point he was expected to 
display a 'Master work' to his guildmasters. If they found that this was
indeed the quality of work expected of a master the journeyman would be 
raised to that rank. He could then open his own shop and legally take
apprentices. Guildmasters were elected by the masters of the guild for some
defined term of office.

Locally, and in this present age, non of our baronial guilds are so formal.
I have been told that I am a journeyman brewer, a journeyman vintner and
an apprentice chirurgeon in the appropriate interkingdom or kingdom guilds.
I may try to be listed as a journeyman in every kingdom guild I can find, as
my project for the next three years. To this end, I would like to see 
contact points for all known guilds in the realm.

Unfortunately, in the Middle, Folks with Grants of Arms (what you
get when you come to your senses and stop being a Great Officer)
are called "Your Lordship" or "Your Ladyship". I personally

Subject: Forms of address and Persnickety Peers

It has been my experience in the SCA that it is almost impossible to go to a 
kingdom event and not offend someone by your form of address, period or not.  
There are some peers who expect you to be formal and correct, there are some 
peers who would rather that you didn't call attention to their honors or would 
rather be known by Pelican title than Count/ess title, there are some peers
who have a different notion of what formal and correct is, and there are the
peers who get offended when you ask them how you should refer to them, which
incidentally is my default opening line.  "How should I refer to you, my lord,
when speaking to you?" 

It is also true that those who get offended were apparently in the minority, 
but they are also the ones who make the most noise about it.  It should seem 
to me that a firmer kingdom policy on the topic should prevail, and that those 
who have gone and gotten titles should be required to use them, unless they 
are willing to renounce them.  It is most frustrating to overhear a countess
claiming that she didn't have a good time at an event, because people kept 
refering to her as "Countess" in their speech, and she had really preferred to 
be just "ordinary" folk that day, and not have people address her as royalty.  
This may certainly be doable, if not completely acceptable, at a local event, 
but it's discouraging to the rest of us who are trying to be "proper" to be 
reprimanded for behaving "correctly" in public.  

Does anyone have any advice or commentary on this topic?

I seem to remember reading somewhere that a good guide to courtesy is to
treat your lessers as your equals and your equals as your superiors.
(_Queen_Carol's_Guide_?) I don't know if this extends to form of address,
but I've yet to find anyone who's violently objected to a momentary
increase in rank.

I personally have a bit of a problem with my title: I am a member of the
Order of the Jambe de Lion (An Tir Arts) and therefore am introduced as
"Her Ladyship Elizabeth Braidwood". But how do I refer to myself? "Hi, I'm
Her Ladyship Elizabeth" doesn't quite flow, y'know? I've seen "The Honorable
Lady/Lord" used in reference to a Lady/Lordship, but rarely.

(And I've heard all the jokes about "Ships passing in the night" too.)

     Hmmmm I'm really strongly against "firmer kingdom policies" regarding
titles just to avoid offending a small minority who want to play "What's My
Peerage". Moresoever, I don't want to take the freedom away from those who
decline to accept their titles in daily usage of their name, but would still 
like to maintain it for Grand Marches, Twelfth Nights and the like.

     Part of the Society is courtesy, and that extends to educating people 
in your aquaintence and people whom you've just met in the desired form of
address of your name. A slight, polite correction is all that is needed, "I'm 
sorry my Lord/Lady, I would prefer that you use (put in the appropiate title/
non-title as appropiate)". Those that insist on playing "Name that Peer" 
should remember that the vast majority of the world is not telepathic and that
they are trying the best that they can. To become angry and sullen because 
an incorrect title is used is rude and inconsiderate behavior, both in the
Society and in the mundane world.

     Many non-peers and new members often have a devil of a time trying to 
sort out the "funny hats" in their pwn realms, not to mention those 
dignateries from foreign realms who make an occasional visit. To continually
change your title and rank at each event without establishing a form of 
address is rude and inconsistant behavior. It would not be desirable in the
real world, why should it be accepted in the SCA?

     This is clearly unworkable and undesirable to me, for reasons which
I've outlined above. It shouldn't be necessary to legislate courtesy.

     It was her own damn fault. But I digress.

     Everytime I think the Society is big enough to encompass a wide and 
diverse population dedicated to the same ideals, I hit something like this.
It's too bad that people forget that one of the cornerstones of the Society,
for both peerage and non-peerage is suppose to be courtesy. Remembering that

     Too much. The SCA is a recerational activity for all of us, I don't see
that it benifits anyone to be discourtious and rude when a pleasant, gentle
correction is all that is required. Just be consistantly nice in correcting 
those who mispronounce or mangle your name and title and you'll find that
others will respond in kind.

On the subject of silly forms of address, I've been told that Settmour
Swamp's charter indicates that the correct and proper title for the
Baron or Baroness is "Your Mudship".  This has apparently been going
on for years, so I guess it is scrawled in mud by now (as opposed to

The following information is paraphrased from "Protozoology" by Kudo.
(pages 466-470)

Trich is the common name for an infection by Trichomonas vaginalis
(Donne').  T. vaginalis is a small flagellate (protozoan) (10-30u x
10-20u) that is parasitic in the human reproductive organ (both sexes).
Although the organism does NOT enter the vaginal tissues, many observers
believe it to be the cause of certain diseases of the vagina.  Asami
and Nakamura (1955) innoculated axenic culture of the organism into
nine volunteers and came to conclude that vigorous consumption of
glycogen in the vaginal mucosa by the flagellate facilitates the 
bacterial invasion and brings about the vaginitis.  More recent observers
such as Bertrand and Deulier, Catterall and Nicol(1960), Chappaz(1960),
etc. consider that T. vaginalis is pathogenic.

Also - Dobell infected himself deliberately in 1934.  The infection lasted
four and a half years and caused him no problems.

End Paraphrase.

Following is from "Illustrated Guide to the Protozoa" by the Society of
Protozoologists:
Start Quote  (page 123)

In many countries, T. vaginalis is a common -- in some populations the
commonest -- venereal disease.  The 3 species in the genus are 
morphologically similar but differ physiologically.  T. vaginalis and
Tritrichomonas foetus are anaerobic.  Enzymes in hydrogenosomes ( compact
bodies scattered along the axostyle) dispose of excess H2, pyruvate or
malate (Muller, 1980). Theraputic efficacy of nitroimidazoles (e.g.
metronidazole) depends on inhibition of this system;  the drug may
help reconstruct evolutionary history of the hydrogenosome.

End Quote 

So ... if I read this correctly, this is a fairly small protozoan that
does not directly enter the body but rather lives on the surface and
consumes the protective coating of the vagina.  Problems then occur
(yeast infection?) due to some other pathogen invading the unprotected
site.  This MIGHT be tricky to diagnose but I AM NOT A DOCTOR!  It just
happens that protozoology is a hobby of mine.  If you get recurring
infections, you might want to check again for trich.

If sufficient interest, I can probably dig up some specific references
from the Journal of Protozoology.  It doesn't seem too serious - you
aren't going to die from it - but it doesn't look like much fun either.

                 AGAIN - SEE A REAL DOCTOR - if you think you
                 have a medical problem.

True, good my lady.  In fact, I don't believe there was ever a formal
beginning cut-off date.  However, the stated purpose of the SCA is and
always has been to re-create the culture and society of the Western
European Middle Ages.  Other cultures are welcomed as visitors to that
re-creation.  One can make a reasonable case for Japanese, for
example, but it gets really hard to explain how Neanderthals are
visitors to medieval Europe.  Ooh, images the persona stories....

Greetings!

Not to contradict, my lord Josef, but I fear you err.  As far as I
know, the following terms of address are universal in the SCA:

Kings & Queens		Your Majesty
Princes & Princesses    Your Highness
Duchy rank		Your Grace
County, Viscounty,
& Baronial rank		Your Excellency

In general, it is a gaff to address someone by a title higher than
they deserve, but there is nothing wrong with using a title lower,
since they certainly deserve that title as well.  I personally address
my King as "My Leige" as often as not, since that is, after all, what
he is!  On the other hand, any gentle in fealty to any noble could
equally address him as "My Leige."  Certainly "Sire" would be
considered appropriate address for any Royalty.

Greetings!

Since you got a reponse from Caid, I figured it would be nice to give
you one from the East as well.  In this Kingdom, "Apprentice" is a
title used by the retainers of a Companion of the Laurel, much as
"Squire" is used for the retainers of a Knight.  Similarly, "Protege"
is used for the retainers of a Companion of the Pelican, and
occasionally, "Thane" is used (semi-unofficially) for the retainers of
a Master of Arms.

The first three of these designations were made official by Master
Wilhelm von Schlussel as Laurel about 5 years ago.  However,
"Apprentice" & "Journeyman" are used by guilds here as a guild
ranking.  Indeed, some guilds use the title "master" modified by the
art (i.e., Master Brewer, Master Armorer, etc) in the same way.

First: "This isn't period" and "Henry VIII..." shouldn't go together in the same
       paragraph, as Henry VIII died over 50 years before the standard "period"
       cutoff date of 1600.  You may be correct in the strict sense of "this
       isn't medieval" (but then again, maybe not -- see below), but "period"
       encompasses not just "medieval", but also "Renaissance", by most
       definitions (and there is still occasional lobbying to extend it
       further); as it is, applying a strict date cut-off is not ideal, since
       cultures go through similar phases at differing times in widely
       separated places  [ I have some "Polish Renaissance Music" on a record
       which sounds rather like Susato/Arbeau-period dance music, but was
       written around 1650; similar arguments exist for art, architecture, and
       other leading indicators of "medieval" or "Renaissance" period-ness ],
       but ideal or not, that's what we've got.  I don't feel strongly enough
       about it one way or the other to argue further for either the strict
       adherence to the cut-off date scheme (breaking Shakespeare's work in
       half, among other consequences of doing so) or its abolition (so that
       *everyone* can get into the "That's not period" business, each person
       with his own definition of and standards for "period");  I just point
       out that if Henry VIII was called "your majesty", then it is period by
       the prevailing standard.

Second: an excerpt from the Oxford English Dictionary on the use of "majesty"
       as an honorific title [italicized words enclosed in asterisks]:

       "This use, common to all the Rom. langs., and from them adopted into all
       the living Teut. langs. [OED's abbreviations, not mine-JdM], descends
       from the Latin of the later Roman Empire (*tua, vestra majestas*).
       In England it occurs, in its Latin form, from the 12th c., though
       examples of the vernacular form are not met with before the 15th c.  It
       was not until the 17th c. that *your majesty* entirely superseded the
       other customary forms of address to the sovereign.  Henry VIII and Queen
       Elizabeth were often addressed as 'Your Grace' and 'Your Highness', and
       the latter alternates with 'Your Majesty' in the dedication of the Bible
       of 1611 to James I."

       We see now that, while perhaps not the prevailing form of address for
       the King of England (leaving Kings of other lands out of this for now),
       "majesty" was used to address them as far back as Henry II (the OED
       example dates from 1171), though in Latin (which, in written form at
       least, was probably more common than contemporary "English", making its
       preservation until the time of the OED more likely; the language of the
       Royal Court at that time was Norman French, in any case).

Third: the SCA has, by tradition and/or Heraldic fiat, standardized the forms of
       address for most SCA ranks, based mainly on the customary British usage
       of the 17th century, with some exceptions.  [Modern British usage, like
       SCA usage, tends towards the "every rank has one preferred form of
       address associated with it" standard, though which FoA goes with which
       rank is quite different, and even in British usage there are a few
       titles which share forms of address -- Earls & Barons are both "Right
       Honourable" in Britain, and both "His Excellency" in the SCA.]
       Most historically-defensible alternate forms of address are accepted in
       the spirit in which they are used. (Even if you could document that some
       historic Earl tolerated being called "Your Foolishness", there would
       still be a lot to be said for NOT addressing a visiting SCA Earl in such
       a manner; "Your Excellency" is fine; "Your Highness", "Your Majesty",
       or "Your Grace", being standard SCA usages for ranks higher than Earl
       should be avoided as well).  As for *incorrect* FoA's, it is up to the
       nobles so addressed to worry about whether or not they'll be upset if
       someone makes an error.  If someone does make an error, he/she should be
       *instructed privately*, rather than held up for public ridicule -- there
       *may* be a good reason (A friend & former neighbor of mine asked a lot
       of friends NOT to call her "Your Highness" or "Your Majesty" during her
       reigns, mainly because she figured she'd hear it sufficiently often from
       everyone else that she'd get sick of it if we did it, too).  There are
       also acceptable variants in a lot of cases (e.g.,  for non-English
       personae).  I believe that there are Herald's Handbooks available on the
       Kingdom (or maybe the Society) level which should list the current
       standard forms of address.  (At least the Middle Kingdom Herald's Manual
       of about 10 years ago did).

                                Yours in Service to the Society,
                                        Jeremy de Merstone

p.s.  I did a lot of research on this sort of thing several years back when
there was talk of reserving the titles "Squire" and "Esquire" for former Great
Lords/Ladies of State, a proposal which naturally alarmed many squires (lower
case s) who would have been left without an obvious alternative ("fighter's
apprentice" doesn't sound so period).  I don't recall whether this was SCA-wide
(I think it was) or just Middle Kingdom;  I did research on alternatives to
"Squire" that might be acceptable to the former GL&L;  I think that the matter
had been resolved before <whoever it was> got the letter which the squires of
my Barony sent, and former GL&L are now "Your Honor" or something like that.

	Addressing current royalty by "Majesty" is SCA custom from 
I-know-not-when [read "SCA tradition" :-)]. At least here in Caid,
the usages of the other forms of address are [in order]:
heard about as often, heard occasionally, heard from those who have
sworn fealty directly to the Crown, heard only between his first and second
reigns, and heard rarely [I guess because the King is to exemplify the
standards of knighthood, be he currently a knight or soon to be so].

	Judging from the SCA royalty I have known, all these would be
properly respectful, though some depend on the speaker and others the royal
person. The appelation "Your Grace" is the exception, being reserved for
Counts and Countesses.

	Though with the occasional slip, this is not a problem. I *still*
have the urge to address TRM Brion and Alysandra as Their Highnesses;
that title is given to Crown Prince and Princess, and they attended and
highly enjoyed my household's last tournament [officially sponsored by the
Barony].

	If you are talking about medieval guild rankings, my impression
is that a Master is a full member of the guild, practicing the trade for his
living; the Journeyman is an associate member, earning his living in his
trade while trying to get enough experience and reputation to join the
guild; and an Apprentice is being trained to practice his trade to prepare
him for earning a living. Masters could train apprentices, journeymen couldn't.
	Within Caid, at least, these levels are used for ranking skill levels
at the various arts at competitions. The ranking goes Apprentice, Journeyman,
then Artisan-- the title "Master/Mistress" being reserved for those who have
so excelled in a certain form, been very noble, and have taught their skills
to others, that the Crown has decided to honor them with nobility. In Caid,
the nobility ("peerage") award recognizing such a level of skill and commitment
is the Dolphin.
	As for differences in crafts, well, the material product changes
but the pride of true craftsmanship never dies. Ask any artist you admire.

To Atarishi Kitagawa: one good source that I have used for Japanese garb are
patterns by Folkware.  They have a kimono pattern, field clothing (kind-of
modern), and one other.  Folkware is good because they include information on
traditional fabrics, designs, colors, etc.  The patterns are relatively easy to
use, I've made a simple kimono in a couple of hours.  I have a pattern for
hakama pants that came from a friend of mine who had made them.  Basically, a
simple harem-type pant that is cut very wide, then pleated to a waist band.  The
pants are left open on both side seams for about 6 inches.  The waistband is
made in two pieces, the back band long enough to tie in front, the front band
wraps around the back and ties in front.  This, of course, is off the top of my
head and having made them a couple of years ago.  Good luck!

Message-Id: <591027388/kee@A.NL.CS.CMU.EDU>

The BoD asked kingdoms to comment on this proposal.  At the East
Kingdom Curia held at the Pennsic War, a near-unanimous decision was
made to have the Kingdom Seneschale send a letter to the BoD strongly
recommending AGAINST this proposal.  Fighting is certainly not the only
reason that liabililty insurance costs so much.  It would cost us about
the same amount if we didn't have fighting, because fighting is not a
high-risk activity as far as the insurance companies go.  (About half of
the $6.00 cost of an associate membership goes for insurance, according
to Aidan, our Kingdom Seneschale.)

Thus, it certainly looks like it would be very unfair to fighters as a
group to require that they must be paid members in order to participate
in their chosen activities.

I agree that the character of the SCA is greatly enhanced by not
requiring paid membership in order to participate.  I think we would
lose a great deal if we gave that up.  I've been hanging out with the
SCA for 13 years (as of this month) and have only spent about 5 of them
as a paid member; the SCA was something I participated in actively when
I was the poorest I've ever been in my life (1980-1982) and could just
barely afford a place to live.

As things stand, I see no advantage to the Society in *requiring* paid
membership for non-officers.

Subject: TUCHUX

I am replying to some notes I've seen here which suggest that the
Tuchux are being banned from the next Pensic War.  I find this a
rather apalling suggestion.  If one or two or even fifteen people from
a group behave poorly, then those people should be spoken to by people
that they are likely to respect.  Banning an entire group of people 
because there was some reckless or other poor behaviour on the part
of individuals is a VERY BAD IDEA!

Although I did not go to the war, I heard many tales about a fighter
being ordered off the field of battle by the marshals for unsafe and
discourteous (sp?) conduct.  Now, by analogy, his entire barony,
or household, or other group should be banned from the next Pensic
as well as himself!

The Tuchux have a specific coherence as a group which makes them visible
to everyone.  This means that it only takes one or two incidents to make
everyone believe that all Tuchux (all Caroligians, all <fill in your group>)
are the same.  From my own experience with the Tuchux, they are individual 
people who have a certain irreverant and very pleasurable model of 
primitive barbaric behaviour.  Don't bann the Tuchux, ban unreasonable
behaviour!

Oh gentle reader of this missive -  from Sir Michael of York accept
good greetings and wishes that this letter may find you and yours in
good health.  Pray listen to my gentle pleadings---

I have taken finger to keyboard to seek for information from this
great etherial domain on the area of siege engines in these modern
medieval times as well as the medieval medieval times (!).  I have 
two different requests of gentles that may have similar interests.

Firstly, hath any person heard of or participated in a siege engine 
competition?  I have heard of rumours of one such at a Pennsic some
large number of years ago, but the rumour spoke of models (i.e., only
tossing small steel ball bearings).  Any good stories should be of 
interest to both me and all readers of this forum, so please burden 
us with your tales!!!

Secondly, I watched one treberchet in action recently at a very small
camping event in Stonemarche (NH), and have promised (rather foolishly
I admit) to bring some form of ballista to Stonemarche next spring for
a competition.  My request is for sources of good documentation or
suggestions for designs.  The throw weight should be in the five-to-ten
pound range, as that's all I'm willing to engineer.  I am not
interested (at this point) in gun-powder weapons, slings and catapults
being about my limit.  I have started in on this effort utilizing the
large libraries in the Boston area, but thought that a few pointers
from others with similar experience might be wise (no fool me! no need
to retrace old ground!).

Please send me messages through this wierd medium of e-mail, or via
Snail-Mail.  I will summarize any such missives I receive for the 
gentle readers of this forum (thus sparing them reading several suggestions
of the same form... :-).

I send my grateful thanks to you for listening (um.. reading) and heap
the blessings of your favorite diety upon you for any help you
can render me.

Subject: The size problem
Message-Id: <591028118/kee@A.NL.CS.CMU.EDU>

Yes, the size problem definitely exists in the East.  The current
provisions for governance--the structure of officers and the duties of
the Crown--is being substantially strained by the huge size of the Kingdom.
There is only so much that any one person, or even a cooperating group
of people, can pay attention to at once (and still have some semblance
of a mundane life. ;-)  There really are about 2000 sustaining members in
the East.  Not every sustaining member gets "Pikestaff", either (I know
of 2 in this Barony who get the "Pale" instead), though the vast
majority of them do.

The last time I did a membership count for Debateable Lands (sometime
last spring, when I was Seneschale) there were about 104 paid members,
about 3/4 of them sustaining and the rest associate or family members.
If you take that as a rough estimate for the East, then we are talking
about around 2600 people who have official membership cards.  Now, in
Debateable Lands we actually have about twice as many people
participating as we have paid members.  (This does NOT count members 
that are heard from occasionally, but are not very active.)
Apply that to the Kingdom as a whole, and get 5200.  The number for
which that is an estimate, is the actual workload for the Kingdom 
Officers--the number of active members.

It is my considered opinion that the system works much more smoothly
and consistently at around a quarter of that size.  

Principalities can help alleviate the burden on the Kingdom-level
Royalty and officers, because Principality officers keep their own
rosters and handle the reports within their area, and because the
Prince and Princess of a Principality can give AoA's and
Principality-level awards without having to clear it through the
Kingdom level.  This may not sound like much on the face of it, but it
really does represent a significant chunk of the bread-and-butter work.

Some people that I have talked to from other Kingdoms, and from the
East as well, have expressed the opinion that having the East be so
huge presents something of a danger to the Society as a whole, because
of the possibility for it to dominate Society-wide interaction just
because of its size.  I doubt that this is a real problem.  For one
thing, the East is far from being monolithic in its cultural and
political tendencies.  It is, in fact, extremely diverse.  For another,
there seems to be a tendency for influence and recognition in the SCA
as a whole to come in "Kingdom-shaped bundles".  That is to say, just
being a Kingdom bestowes a certain amount of "pull", which amount in
the case of the East is being spread over a very large number of
individuals.

Thus, in being "so veddy, veddy, BIG" (and lacking much of the additional
internal structure provided for by Principalities) the East poses more
of a problem to itself than it does to the SCA as a whole.

Given all this, it really works amazingly well, in my opinion.  (Please
note that most of this post consists of my opinions, in fact. ;-)

Pardon my ignorance, but why are ALL Tuchux being banned as punishment

reprehensible acts which are being discussed on this list.  To me,
it seems like a rather unjust measure to use, considering that there

CORRECTION!!

Eastern Crown Tourney is indeed scheduled for October 29, but is not
in Anglespur, as I had posted earlier.  It is in fact just next door,
in Brewerskeep, a new canton of Concordia.  The Anglespur event
scheduled for that date has been cancelled, and the classes/seminars
scheduled at Anglespur have been moved to the Crown site.

Sorry for any confusion.

Does anyone know why SCA kings & queens are addressed "Your Majesty"?

As far as I know, this isn't period. The "majesty" was reserved
for the Holy Roman Emperor, and only at the end of the Middle Ages
did other kings become "majestic". I believe Henry VIII was the first
English king thus addressed, and it came even later for Queens.

In the Middle Ages proper, one would say "My lord King", "Sire",
"My Liege", "Your Grace" or "Sir King". Would those forms of address
be considered discourteous by SCA Kings? (Where I live, we seldom
see any kings.)

The current Pikestaff subscriptions now come to 2103, for October, 1988.
Approximately 10% of these are out-of-kingdom subscriptions.

Not accounting for Associate/Family members who don't get the newsletter, nor
accounting for all the Sustaining (and above) members who get some other

Well, from what I can tell it won't collide with any other event that is
already established.

One other point about this planned event:  The site will be almost free so
the cost to those attending should be minimal, unlike Pennsic, which was
just a bit on the steep side.

Now I just have to figure out what to do with Salami bin Nissan, the Pseudo
Saracen meat storage in a Japanese truck, aka Todd.

I know, archery point. ;-)

Incidentally, the current suggested name (other than Todd's weirdness) is
the Punic Wars.  Any better ideas?

     In addition to at least two documented cases of injury involving
Tuchux (without attributing fault or blame for the incidents to any
party), there were cases reported of several Tuchux members duplicating
selling, and forging authorization cards.                              
     If true, this could explain the action of the Society Marshal, given
that the BoD has of late been highly concerned with the issue of liability.
If a case involving injury came to court, and it was revealed that the
fighter who caused the injury was not an authorized fighter, the Society
could be held liable for damages due to negligence (for letting an
unauthorized, i.e., assumed undertrained and possibly dangerous, fighter,
on the field).  Anybody who has participated in any of the Pennsic battles
knows the degree of chaos that prevails, and it would be almost absolutely
impossible to determine the authenticity of an authorization card on the
field, even if by some chance the cards were actually required. ;-)
     It *may* be that the final result of the decision will be an attempt
to see that "Tuchux" (however that is defined) who fight all have 
authorization cards signed by a recognizable "kingdom" marshall,
rather than allowing Tuchux to use their current cards.  This, and almost
any scheme proposed or tried involving cards and such at Pennsic will
surely fail, unless the whole authorization card setup is made a great
deal more organized.
     Will this happen?  I personally don't believe so.  I've been wrong
before, however.  Still, I trust in the level of chaos inherent in any
all-volunteer organization of 10000+ people.

    Caveat:  Treat the information contained in this missive, in its

Subject: Period dances

Re: is Arbeau period?

Sure. But you have to bear in mind that regional variation, sometimes over
pretty small regions, is *also* period. As I recall, Arbeau himself admits
once or twice that some of the other major dance masters do the dances
somewhat differently from him. This is why I tend to come down somewhat
hard on people who jump around screaming, "That's not period!", for minor
variations. We don't really *know* what's period, and I would say that a
certain amount of liberty with the dances may not make the dances un-period.
How much variation is acceptable? That's a matter for the discretion of the
dancemaster, who is, hopefully, educated enough to make an intelligent
decision.

I'd be *very* interested in hearing her argument for why the pavane is
incorrectly described, though. I can see one or two possibly convincing
arguments (for instance, if a few of Arbeau's students describe him doing
the dance differently).

(Side question: has anyone seen any particularly interesting commentary
about period attitudes towards regional variation? Many in the Society
seem to have trouble with it; I hear, "That's not right!", rather often,
usually about a matter upon which the period sources are silent. My gut
feeling is that this is a more modern phenomenon, due to the improved
communications of the past few centuries, but I don't really have any
evidence for that.)

Not a good guess.  The East has 2100 subscribers to the kingdom newsletter.
The East really does have a size problem; it's not just poor management.

No doubt Mitchell will correct me but as far as I understand these things,
the print run for Pikestaff is in excess of 2000 of which around 100 copies
get sent out of kingdom. The remainder, close to 1900 issues, are sent to
subscribing members of one sort or another.

I also remember Jessa commenting that the subscriptions are growing at a
rate of approximately 1% per month. This may be the cause of the difference
in the numbers.

The "Mary Rose" exhibit that toured the U.S. a few years ago had one interesting
piece of information vis-a-vis printed/written sources: the doctor's equipment
found on board (c 1545) was very similar to those described for the first
time in print in the early 17th century.

My first dance instructress, Susan Howell of Indiana University (she *hated*
the S.C.A., for unknown reasons) said that Arbeau must have described in
his book a dance that he had incorrectly remembered; his description does
not match others that are available.  I have her notes somewhere and
can look this up, if anyone is interested.  But, if she is right, is
a pavan danced a l'Arbeau "period"?

Good Gentles:
For the purposes of informing every one about the health hazard, I
report my own experience.  My lord went swimming at the swimming hole.
My lord and I had sex. A week after the war, I had a yeast infection,
which I didnt worry about until I saw all the notices about Trich.
I went and got tested, and did NOT  have trich.
I strongly believe that every one should get tested; but you may 
get good news.  Dont get too hyperactive; just go and get tested!
It took quite a load off of my mind...Trich is not something you want;
nor something you want to give to your love.
In service to the Society, and to health

Hmmm.  Pay good money to have my body bruised and my helm dented 8-).

Seriously though, one of the attractions for myself when I first joined
the SCA many moons ago was the no dues requirement to actually participate.
Site fees are something completely different.  Many of the fighters in the SCA
that I know are pressed to come up with the gas money to get to events; the SCA
is a luxury that they can enjoy because it isn't mandatory to lay down the 
current membership fee for the year so they can fight in the 5 or so tournaments
in driving range each year.  I like being part of an organization that has as
a requirement to join the combination of wanting to participate and the willing-
ness to be responsible for ones own actions (and potential injuries).  If you 
weren't a paid member you didn't get the Kingdom newsletter telling you when all
of these fun events were happening and the other goodies coincidental with the
membership.

From a legal standpoint it was my understanding that the site waiver was the
official "if anything happens to you it's your fault and not ours" notice. Allow
ing only those fighters who are members into tournaments would simplify the 
accounting process if someone was injured, especially since some society names 
change with the season 8-).  I think it would discourage those fighter-types 
with limited resources from fighting and I would lose the chance to play with
these types..

I don't know how many of you out there are in the habit of reading
historical novels, but myself I find this a great source of inspiration.
Since there is a lot of crap in this genre, I do appreciate it when
others share their experience. This makes it easier to find the good
books and avoid the trash.

Here, for those who it may interest, are some of the best I've read
lately:

1. "Robert the Bruce" - a trilogy by Nigel Tranter. The books are
   a. The steps to the empty throne
   b. The pxth of the hero king
   c. The price of the king's peace
   This is easy reading. The books follow the real historic events
   rather well, but adds on the romance and adventure necessary to
   make good novels. The acount of the Battle of Bannockburn is quite
   unforgettable. Read them!

2. "Champion" by L. Christian Balling. A novel about William Marshal.
   The famous knight is pictured in his forties, after the peak of
   his jousting career. I love this book!

3. ...and of course, the Lymond trilogy by Dorothy Dunnett:
   a. The game of kings
   b. Queen's Play
   c. The disorderly knights
   These books are set in 16th century Scotland and France. Among
   history buffs, they have become classics already. Impressive.

If anyone else has reading suggestions, I would welcome them.

             Life in the Current Middle Ages

SCA is the Society for Creative Anachronism, which is a group
dedicated to recreating the Middle Ages in the present. Many
groups meet weekly, and at these meetings we dance, talk, study,
learn, revel, and make plans. But first, let's get a little bit
of info about the SCA in general.
 
              Where did the SCA come from?
              ___________________________
 
 The avowed purpose of the SCA is the study and recreation of the
 European Middle Ages, its crafts, sciences, arts, traditions,
 literature, etc. The SCA "period" is defined to be 600 AD to 1600 AD,
 concentrating on the Western European High Middle Ages. Under
 the aegis of the SCA we study dance, calligraphy, martial arts,
 cooking, metalwork, stained glass, costuming, literature....
 well, if they did it, somebody in the SCA does it (Except die of
 the Plague!).
 
 As you can probably guess, the thing that separates the SCA from
 a Humanities 101 class is the *active* participation in the
 learning process. To learn costuming, you design and build
 costumes. To learn SCA infantry fighting, you make armor,
 weapons, shields, etc., and put them on and go learn how it
 feels to wear them when somebody is swinging a (rattan) sword at
 you. To learn brewing, you make (and sample!) your own wines,
 meads and beers.
 
 You will frequently hear a SCA person describe the SCA as
 recreating the Middle Ages "as they ought to have been." In some
 ways this is true -- we have few plagues, indoor plumbing, few
 peasants. In the dead of winter we have other things to eat than
 King's venison, salt pork and dried tubers.
 
 The SCA was invented (? discovered? begun?) in 1966 in Berkeley,
 California by a group of Science Fiction and Fantasy fans who
 wanted a "theme" party. Following the party, a group got
 together to discuss the idea of a medieval re-creation and
 re-enactment group. (which has ended up being much like the
 Civil War, Revolutionary War or Buckskinning re-enactment groups
 that were beginning to form in the US.) In Britain Medieval and
 British Civil War recreation societies had existed for any
 number of years. The Californians incorporated as a non-profit
 educational society, started forming groups, and away they went.
 
 Since 1966, the society has grown to include nearly 13,000
 paying members in the US, Canada, Mexico, Great Britain, Sweden,
 Germany, Italy, France, Korea, Okinawa, New Zealand, Australia
 and Greenland. Current demographic estimates indicate that for
 every dues-paying member there are 4 non-subscribing members
 active in local groups.
 
               How is the SCA Organized?
               ________________________
 
 The SCA is a feudal society. No democracies for us! The SCA
 "Knowne World" is divided into twelve Kingdoms, each with a King
 and Queen (who rule by right of arms), a Prince and Princess
 (heirs to the throne), and a council or Curia of Great Officers
 who handle the mundane, day to day details of running the
 kingdom.
 
 A feudal society takes its form from the idea of honor and duty.
 A noble owes duty of service to his lord, who might be a Baron or
 Knight.  His lord owes in return the duty of protection from danger and 
 food, money, etc. when times are bad.
 
 On the next level up, the higher nobles owe fealty (the word that
 encompasses this idea of reciprocal responsibilities) to the
 King. In return for their service as good stewards of the land
 and readily available warriors, the King owes Knights, Barons, and 
 other high nobles protection, honor, and a return of money, food, etc in 
 times of hardship. It is something like the idea of a Pyramid
 club, but the benefits are greater and the idea of personal
 honor and mutual responsibility, not profit, tie the structure
 together (or at least it did in Europe for nearly a thousand
 years).
 
 In the SCA this structure underlies our Society, although not
 nearly as rigidly as in the medieval days. Our King, the head of
 our Kingdom and our liege lord, has fought for the right to bear
 the crown by fighting in a Crown Tourney for the right to make
 his Lady Queen. <In the case of female fighters, she has fought
 for the right to make her Lord King.> In some Kingdoms, like the West
 (middle California), the King's word is law, and the people willingly
 obey his every whim. Of course, four to six months later there is a new
 King, with different ideas. Life can get interesting.
 
 Fighting in the SCA, or Why are those people hitting each other?
 _______________________________________________________________
 
 Fighting in the SCA evolved from what happened when two armed
 knights were unhorsed and had to fight on the ground. It
 resembles nothing so much as medieval infantry fighting. There
 are two basic types of SCA fights: single combat, and group or
 team battles, known as melees. SCA fighting does have rules. The
 first, and most important rule, is that each and every fighter
 on the field has honor. The fighter keeps faith with his honor
 by accepting blows that would be killing or wounding (more about
 this a little later).
 
 The second is like unto it; A fighter keeps faith with his
 brother fighters by acknowledging his opponent's word -- if he
 says it was light, it was light. Since we prefer that no one get
 hurt, SCA fighting is done with real armor (made with leather,
 metal, padding, kydex, etc) and rattan swords. Rattan is that
 bamboo-y stuff, only with a solid core, that furniture is made
 of. Rattan, surprisingly enough, is springy enough to absorb
 some of the force of the blow (although blows are *real solid*)
 and light enough to approximate a real steel sword. Swords are
 made by wrapping rattan staffs with strapping tape, covering
 them with duct tape (known as silver tape) for esthetic reasons,
 and attaching some sort of hilt or handle. Armor is much more
 complex -- some armor, being made of steel, rivets, leather,
 etc, can take more than 40 hours per piece of armor (for
 example, a armored "glove" with moving fingers and joints can
 take upwards of 75 hours to complete).
 
 There are several essential and required pieces of armor --
 helm, neck and cervical vertebrae protection, elbows and knees,
 kidneys, hands, groin. After that, most SCA fighters wear chest,
 leg, arm and forearm, and feet protection.
 
 If a blow hits hard enough that a sword would have cloven mail,
 it is "good". Beginning fighters, as they are being trained, are
 taught blow calibrations. Fighters are trained, by the way.
 Aspiring fighters attend some months of fighter practices where
 they learn the rules and learn how to protect themselves on the
 field. After some time, they attempt to "authorize" -- they go
 before a panel of experienced fighters, fight a couple of
 rounds, and if the panel decides the fighter is safe (not good,
 you understand, but unlikely to hurt him or herself or an
 opponent) they are authorized to fight in Tourneys. This process
 (from starting to fight to being authorized) can take from a
 couple of months to a year or more.
 
 Fighting brings us to *the Chivalry.* The Chivalry is a group of
 elite fighters -- those who have gotten very very good at
 fighting, and who at the same time have absorbed the concepts of
 Honor and Chivalry (they're basically good guys), have learned
 something of basic Heraldry, Chess, something about the Arts and
 Sciences, can behave well in public, and are generally good
 examples for people everywhere.
 
 (The word Chivalry comes from the Old French *chevalerie*
 <related to the Spanish *caballeria*>, meaning horse-fighter,
 cavalry, "knight". It came to French and Spanish from Latin
 caballerius, horse rider. As only the wealthy could afford the
 horse and trappings of a mounted warrior, it became the province
 of the nobles to be mounted and fighters. Thus the elite status.
 The word has come down to us from a different route as
 *cavalry*. Oh, well!) <There are rank-equivalents to Knights in
 the Arts and Sciences, called "Laurels", and in the Services,
 called "Pelicans". I will discuss them later on!>
 
 A King (if he is himself a Knight, and not all Kings are) can
 knight a fighter if he (or she) thinks the candidate is
 deserving. Usually the other Chivalry have agreed, or it doesn't
 happen. (If the King isn't a Knight, another member of the
 Chivalry can hold the sword with the King. Only a Knight can
 make a Knight.) The Knights swear personal fealty to the Crown.
 Since some people, for religious reasons, reasons of personal
 honor, etc, feel that swearing fealty is inappropriate for them,
 a branch of Chivalry has been created, called Masters, who do
 not have to swear fealty. Upon receiving the accolade of
 Knighthood, the candidate receives a Gold chain to wear about
 the neck, a white belt, and gold spurs. Some receive a *real*
 sword, as well.
 
       Why Do you all have such funny names?
       _____________________________________
 
 Every person in the SCA picks a name to use in the Society. It
 could be something simple (George of Wardcliff) or something
 elaborate (Dughall Aislean nic mac Lathurna). Most people pick a
 time period in the SCA "period" (between 600 and 1600) and a
 country (any place that can documentably be proven to have had
 trade with western Europe during the period), and choose a name
 from that. Some people just pick a name and forget about it;
 some have elaborate persona stories to go with their names.
 
 Even our towns have new names. Lansing, MI, is Northwoods,
 Toronto is Septentria, Boston is Carolingia, the San Francisco
 bay area is the Principality of the Mists, etc.
 
 Most folk in the SCA register their names and a heraldic device
 that they design to represent them. Also, later in their SCA
 careers, they may be given awards and rank, at which time their
 devices become "Arms" and they are most properly called "Lord"
 or "Lady So-and-So."
 
 Rank in the SCA, or How Come She is Wearing a Crown?
 ____________________________________________________
 
 There are two sorts of peers in the SCA; Royal Peers and Peers.
 Royal Peers are folk who have worn the crown of a Kingdom or
 Principality at least once. Ex-Princes are Viscounts,
 Ex-Princesses Viscountesses, and from there it gets complex.
 Those who have been King or Queen once are Counts/Countesses.
 Those who have been King or Queen twice are Dukes/Duchesses.
 Those who have been King or Queen more than that are generally
 considered masochistic! (Small in-joke!) Seriously, there are
 many who have reigned at least three times, and in the West
 there is a legendary Duke who has been King eight times.
 
 Other sorts of Peers are folk who, through dint of talent, hard
 work, and long effort, are recognized for their contributions
 and skills. We have already talked about the Knights. There are
 also the Companions of the Laurel (Talented craftsmen and artists,
 recognized for having talents and being willing to teach and be
 gracious), and the Companions of the Pelican (generally skilled
 bureaucrats -- somebody *has* to do the hard paperwork of running a
 Kingdom with 3000 people in it, and some people keep working at this
 sort of task for years.). The Pelican was thought in medieval times to
 be the most self-sacrificing animal -- it was thought a Pelican would 
 pierce her beast to allow her heart's blood to drip into the
 mouths of her offspring when food was short. Peers are made by
 the desire of the King and Queen in accordance with the
 recommendations of the rest of the order.
 
          Feasting, Dancing and Merrymaking
          ________________________________
 
 One of the most interesting parts of the SCA is the Events --
 the times when we put on our costumes, go out and dance those
 dances we've been practicing, flirt, eat, talk, and generally
 party. Events are held almost every weekend of the year
 somewhere in the country. Most groups hold at least one event
 per year; some larger groups will hold two or more.
 
 At events there are often tourneys, art exhibits or
 competitions, dance classes, workshops, and, later in the
 evening, Royal or Baronial Court, and dancing. Many times there
 will be a Feast in the evening. Other times, for smaller events
 or if a newer group is holding the event, there will be a
 dessert revel (People go out for dinner and then come back for a
 dessert buffet).
 
 The events are the most fun to most folk, because you get to go
 and show off all the things you have been learning in the past
 few months.
 
          What Kind of Person Joins the SCA?
          __________________________________
 
 SCA folk tend to be people like you and me -- just plain folks,
 but people who enjoy doing something more with their weekends. A
 high percentage of SCA members are involved in high tech fields
 -- Computers, Aerospace, high energy physics, etc. This has been
 attributed to the fact that people who play all week with highly
 complex, modern technology find it highly relaxing to spend
 their leisure time working with a different kind of technology,
 in a less modern setting. There are lots of people in all fields
 in the SCA -- historians, writers, secretaries, law enforcement
 personnel, teachers, programmers, insurance agents -- the appeal
 of the SCA is widespread.
 
 A housemate of a SCA person recently said: "From what I can tell
 about these wild and crazy SCA people, they do more than just
 this fighting thing. They really like to make and wear the
 medieval clothes (garb), eat the medieval food, dance the
 medieval dances to the medieval music, maybe even make their own
 medieval music, and other medieval party type activities. They
 also seem to like to be medieval so they can relax and have a
 good time. They are quite willing to talk about SCA or invite
 you to the SCA stuff or whatever."
 
               How You Can Get Involved
               _______________________
 
 We welcome you to our local meetings and our events. You needn't
 join the SCA, Inc, to attend and participate (although if you
 decide to be with us regularly you may wish to join). The only
 requirement to come to an event is that you make some attempt at
 pre-1600 costume -- and most groups have "loaner" costumes for
 people who want to come to their first event.
 
 If you want more information about groups near you, you can call
 our corporate office in Milpitas, CA, at (408) 262-5250, or send
 a notice to this mailing list or newsgroup, or contact the

	I had heard a rumor (possibly falsehood) that there was more than one

this true or, as usual, are my sources (spies ;-)) wrong again? 
	I believe that Graf Syr Shaddan had sent out a general mailing
on this subject and what had happened. This would contain his justification 
for the ban. If someone who has seen this letter and has the inside scoop
can explain( like Sir Alen perhaps) I would appreciate it since what I heard 
as a solution seems unworkable for actually banning them from particpation, 
however it should get the point across to the tuchux. 
	I personnally don't think that an across the board ban of tuchux
will work, as about 90 percent carry SCA authorization cards anyway. My 
question would be what determines the identity of a tuchuk?

What a peculiar rumor !   I have long been interested in how the SCA, like
many groups, generates its own set of "folk traditions" and "common knowledge",
and as a former co-seneschal of the Barony of the North Woods [which indeed
is in Michigan (based in East Lansing)], I'm often surprised & amused by
the manner in which my "homeland" is perceived in regions far away.

Not that it would make any difference just WHERE the "birthplace of the
Middle Kingdom" is, but certainly the North Woods has never begrudged the
"honor" to Tree-Girt-Sea (though St. Louis & Bowling Green, OH, among others,
were in on the start as well).   On the other hand, the North Woods IS of
approximately the same vintage; it just formed independently from them, without
knowing that other groups in the central U.S. were forming, and without their
knowing about it.  Around the time of the official formation of the MK,
circa AS V, the North Woods held its first event.  Soon thereafter, the MK 
and the NW found out about each other;  what has since been called the
North Woods was for a time termed "The Lost Barony" (at our first *official* 
MK event, Baronial status was conferred -- it was determined that the local
SCA population was nearly equal to the combined population of the other
groups making up the MK -- this was, I believe, before the current membership
requirements, and such things were a mite less bureaucratic).  While there was
for some time, perhaps, a certain amount of rivalry between the North Woods 
and the other early MidRealm groups, there was no doubt that THEY had formed 
the Middle Kingdom (and had gone through the hassle of splitting off from West
and East at a time when there was no set procedure for doing such a thing)... 
they just didn't TELL us about it !

As some of you may know the Society Marshall banned the Tuchux from
participation in Pennsic XVIII as a result of a number of incidents
that occurred during Pennsic XVII.

I would like to get in touch with people active in the various clans
to discuss this decision and the rules for Pennsic XVIII.  At this
point it looks like only those with authorized by one of the SCA
kingdoms can play.

I can be reached at any of the addresses below.  I will be in Trimaris

board meeting will be a proposed rule amendment to restrict fighting
to dues paying members of the society.
	I havn't heard much of the discussion as to *why* this is proposed,
though liability was mentioned, but I strongly urge one and all to
write in protest of this proposal.  I feel that it would cripple the
growth of the fighting side of the society, as well as be a major break
with our traditions.
	Currently, the only requirment for membership is an attempt to
be it pre-1600 garb.  Dues are required only from officers.   The only
requirment for fighting is an authorization card (and armor...)  Is there
some pending case that makes us think that we need to impose a restriction
of this nature?  If there is not, I feel that the current authorization
process, flawed as it is, is still the best way to continue operations.

     In the figures I gave for 1 1/2 years ago, I was counting subscribing
members only.  Does the East have nearly 2000 members with or without the
associate members?  My guess would be, with.
     Only subscribing members are counted for membership quotas.

     These are the unofficial, off-the-top-of-my head, and possibly
anachronistic corrections.  The official, current-as-of-last-month, list
of kingdoms, their locations, etc. will come later.  You'll all just have
to suffer until then ;-).

The West kingdom, aside from the numerous "outposts", consists of the
Pricipality of the Mists (San Francisco bay area - the original group),
the Principality of Cynagua (East-Central and North-East California, and
Nevada minus Las Vegas), and a few groups on the California coast to the
North and South of the Mists.

The East also includes W. Virginia, and used to include pretty much of
Maryland until two or three years ago.

The Middle includes most of Kentucky, but part of Western Kentucky is in
Meridies.  I understand that North Woods (I think that's in Michigan)
doesn't recognize Tree-Girt-Sea as the birthplace of the Middle Kingdom,
but I don't know too much about that.

Atenveldt consists of two Principalities: the Sun (Arizona) and
Artemesia (everything else).

Meridies consists of Western Kentucky, most of Arkansas (minus one group
in the North), Louisiana, Tennessee(sp?), Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia,
and the Florida panhandle.  Meridies is famous for its knight life (they
have "Popular Chivalry";-).

Atlantia consists of Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas, but not
Georgia.

Caid also includes a lot of groups in Southern and South-East-Central
(i.e. the southern third of that big valley) California.

Ansteorra does not include any states other than Texas (minus El Paso)
and Oklahoma.

Calontir consists of Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, and a bit
of Northern Arkansas,

Trimaris is the first fourth-generation kingdom, and the first to be
confined to a single state (Florida - they don't even have the panhandle).

The Outlands also includes most of Wyoming ("sheep herding area";-).

This is precisely the problem Monica Pulver wrote "Murder at the War" around.
How do you tell one fighter from another in armor?  We told the scouts that if
a fighter intentionally struck them to memorize anything on him that resembled
heraldry; shield, surcoat, medals around neck, favors, etc.  We would track him
down through the ordinary.  The trouble in this case was that Tuchux don't
wear heraldry.

The best we can tell you is that it was the Tuchux tribe that fought near
Septemtria.  Septemtrian fighters wear a red surcoat with a white or yellow
bear walking to the right.

Incidentally, this was not the only story we heard of a scout being swung at
accidentally.  Several fighters had a "enemy helm = swing sword" reflex.  What
makes this incident stand out from the rest is that the fighter did not 
apologize to the scout for the accidental blow or even stop to see if the 
scout was alright.

Subject: pavans

Justin writes 
	"...the "belle qui" pavane was, I believe, invented in Carolingia, 
although it is pretty close to some of the "real" ones..."

Thoinot Arbeau, from whose book "Orchesographie" [1] we get the arrangement
for the pavane "Belle qui tiens ma vie" has this to say about pavans:
	"The pavan is easy to dance as it is merely two simples (single steps) 
and one double forward and two simples and one double backward.  It is played 
in duple time, you will take note that in dancing it the two simples and the 
double forward are begun with the left foot, and the two simples and one 
double backward are begun with the right foot. ...and if one does not wish to 
move backwards one may continue to advance all the time...
	The musicians sometimes play [the pavan] more quickly to a lighter
 beat, ...and it is called the passamezzo.  
	Recently another one has been introduced, called the Spanish 
Pavan, in which the steps are rearranged with a variety of gestures..
	...some dancers devide up the double that follows the two simples, ... 
resulting in a great number os steps, passages, and embellishments, all of 
which fit into the time and cadence of the music. Such rearrangement and a 
sprightly execution of the steps, tempers the gravity of the pavan,...
	When one knows the steps and movements of one pavan...one can dance 
all the others.  Because although the melodies differ, and they may be eiher 
sung or played, they all have the same number of bars."

The spanish pavan is too complex to be explained here, although it is not 
figured, in that it moves only forward and backward, the doubles are replaced 
by other ornemented steps (T.A. specificly mentions fleurets) and it ends each 
phrase with three kicks.

The only other period pavan i know of is the "Quadran Pavan", found in several 
late 16th centurey manuscripts. [2]  This consists of two singles to the left 
and a double forward left followed by two singles right and a double 
backwards.

The Earl of Salsbury pavan is a reconstruction by Mable Dolmetch (1949).  In 
the past 4 decades the science of dance reconstruction has advanced 
considerabley, and Ms. Dolmetches reconstructions is now generally considered 
to be specious.

I do not know what justification can be given for the circling figure in the 
"carolingian pavan" or for the performance of "quadran p." in which the 
couples make their little squares facing each other, and hence performing a 
neat do-si-do.  The latter is an invention of Dr. Ingrid Brainard, and I 
suspect the former of being the same.  Dr. Brainard is an authority on 
Rennaissance dance, and I trust her judgement on such things as well or better 
than i trust my own judgement on period food, but all you stuffy purists 
should know that these figures are not *strictly* doccumentable.

as i have now lost everyone who is not a *dedicated* dancer, i will give my 
references, close, and continue my more general, philosophical argument in 
another message (which, due to the peculiarities of the system, will no doubt 
appear *first*, confusing everyone...such is life).

publications (switzerland) will happilly sell you a faximili of the original 
french m.s. for an exhorbitant price. Some photocopies may be obtained if you 
ask the right person--??
A trully wonderfull book. get it.  It has clear and detailed instructions on 
the bransles and the galliard *with music* (melody line only usually) and lots 
of incidental comments on how dancing was done, and many usefull and 
entertaining illustrations, etc. etc. etc.

Subject: period?


Justin continues
	"(and [Belle qui] is a heck of a lot *prettier* as a vocal peice, as 
well as more period)"

What, Justin, do you mean by "more period" ?  What, correspondingly would you 
consider to be "less period" ?  What is the relation between "more period", 
and "preferable"?

"period" in S.C.A. usage is defined as falling between the years 400 & 1600, 
or between 400 and 1650, or between 800 and 1500, and occasionally extending 
to 1651 to include Digby and Playford, with additional restrictions as to 
place, although we do accept a few later personae and a few earlier personae 
and a few from the far east and even a few "barbarians" all depending on you 
or your local's philosophy.

So i can understand an argument that called anything between 1500 and 1651 
"more period" if it were earlyer and "less" if it were later, although i would 
not agree with it.  It is far more important to avoid an awkward mixing of 
centuries.e.g. There are many delightfull recipies in Digby's "Closet Opened",
and a feast from digby would be very nice, but to insert one of his dishes into
a feast based on 15c sources would be as jarring as wearing a french hood with
 a sideless surcotte.  And i can see that cavalier might be considered "more 
period" than, say, empire/regency or U.S. civil war,  but i am *not* convinced 
that it is "more period" than a victorian reconstruction of medieval and it is 
certainly neither medieval, rennaissance, nor S.C.A.

How does one judge things that do fall within the targetted years as "more" or 
"less" period??

Specifically, how is a vocal rendission of "Belle Qui Tiens" used as a pavan 
"more period" than an instrumental one?  Arbau gives a four-part version and 
writes out seven verses "since you may some day wish to sing the entire song,"

Of the many dance tunes found in the Susato collection, some were written as 
dances and others were written originaly as songs.  The same is true of 
playford.  Another dance tune which we sometimes sing and sometimes play is 
the "frog galliard" which starts, "Now, oh now, I needs must part."  There is 
a Dowland arrangement of this for lute, *impossible* to dance to, which 
manages to be at once florid and lachrymose. 

Arbeau usually gives only melody and tabor rhythm for his dances.  He assumes 
one is using a drum and a tabor-pipe---an instrument with a mouthpiece like a 
recorder, but only 3 finger-holes and a thumb-hole.  It has a range of nearly 
two octaves.  When asked if it is necessary to use these instruments, he 
replies, 
	"Not unless one wishes it.  One can play them on violins, spinets, 
transvers flutes, flutes with nine holes (recorders), hautboys (oboes), and 
all sorts of instruments.  They can even be sung.  But the tabor with its 
regualr rhythm is an immense help in bringing the feet into the correct 
positions required by the dance."

later his student describes playing galliards for his friends on lute or 
guitar.  "I learned one on the lute," he says, "which I enjoyed seeing danced 
by my companions as I knew how to play and sing it."  

It is clear that many different instruments were used.  It is also clear that, 
if he knows what he is doing, the dancer is under considerable licence to 
ornement and to invent, as is the musician. As  Arbeau says, "Are you no well 
aware that variety delight and that repetiion is odious?  He gives many
 suggestions on how one may ornement certain dances, although he gives few 
choriographies of these ornemented dances.  There exist also manuals for 
musicians on how to ornement a line of music.   In addition, there exist 
suites of "bransle de champagne"  for which no choriography has survived 
(Attaignant's six "Livres de danceerie")  THese, Arbeau tells us, consist 
entirely of bransles single and double steps in varying combination.  Anyone 
could construct a dance of single and double steps that fit the dance music, 
and such an invention, while not strictly doccumentable,  is definetly period.

is it less period than a dance for which we have the choriography?

if Arbeau specifies that in the first repetition of the spanish pavan, one 
performs a sequence of fleurets, and in the following "other movements" are 
used (as he does), and we use fleurets in *all* the repetitions because we 
don't know what those movements *were* (as we do) are we being more or less 
period?

if *everyone* only wore garb that matched in color, cut, and pattern *some* 
existing picture, would our society be "more period"?

if we dance "hole in the wall" (which is, indeed, early baroque) with the 
plain steps of the previous century in stead of the "pas de bouree" which 
properly belong to it, are we making it "more period"?

Perhaps justin's claim that "belle qui" is more period as a vocal piece than 
as an instrumentall stems from the fact that a 20th century voice is a good 
aproximation of a 16th century one, where as the instruments we use tend to be 
baroque of modern...

About five years ago my wife and I went to a performance by the Folger Consort
given at the Folger Library.  Much to our surprise, during an instrumental
performance, two of the other instrumentalists who were not playing began to
dance the Manshaft.  Yes, the Manshaft, written in Northwoods in AS V or
thereabouts.  According to the program the musicians had come from Cincinnati,
where at one point there was considerable traffic between the March of the
Fenix and the acadmic program, which is where I think the transfer took
place.

     Perhaps this has made a lot of people angry.  Perhaps this has been
widely regarded as a bad move.  But it's not as bad as it sounds.
     The people that I'm actually complaining about are just two types:
the people who invent "period" things off the tops of their heads, and
the ones who ignore readily available information.  And I have seen a
fair number of them in action (no names, dates, or incidents will be
mentioned here, you've probably experienced them yourself, in or out of
the SCA).  If people didn't really do these sorts of things, "Korobushka"
and "Scotland the Depraved" (sick (sic) ;-) wouldn't be commonly done in
the SCA.

How odd. This is the way finals are always fought in the West. The
fighters get a clean slate as for deaths, and most of the time the
finals are three fights. Yes, finals are very often held in near dark,
even when running 4 fields during the day. This happens when you get
80+ in the lists! 60 fighters in a Coronet lists is not unheard of.
I know some areas avoid this by haviing 'invitational' lists, but I 
feel that the Western way is more fun for everyone, fighters and
spectators alike. (But then, we always have 2 day Crown tourneys,
and the Coronets are also, these days.)

According to the Laws of An Tir . . .  waitaminute . . . hmmmm. I was going
to say that according to the Laws of An Tir, the Crown Tourney is held as
Double Elimination and that the Crown has the right to request the best two
out of three in the final round. But I just looked it up and there is no
mention on how to conduct the tourney at all. Simply what conditions have
to be met by the fighters and by the winners.

By tradition, therefore, the Crown requests that the final round of an An
Tir Crown tourney be held as a best two out of three. (And everyone knows
that when something is done two reigns in a row, it becomes CARVED IN ROCK!
;-) ) I've seen about 6 An Tir Crown Tourneys now and they've all finished
with best two of three.

> (But then, we always have 2 day Crown tourneys,

Two days - like you have the first 7 or 8 rounds on the first day, go to
bed and finish the tourney on the next day? How odd.

By the way - has anyone mentioned that there were 49 fighters signed up for
the An Tir Crown Lists? (It was VERY hot.)

Subject: Some attempted clarification and breast-beating
Message-Id: <590457757/kee@A.NL.CS.CMU.EDU>

This is in regard to the SCA-TV discussion, which I sort of got going
with a bang.

It was probably foolhardy of me to post about a skit I didn't see.
I have since received mail from Marji, the gentle who asked for comments
about SCA-TV, explaining that the skit in question did not in fact
portray "Isenfir" as a nasty place, but as a very small and apolitical
shire.  She writes, "I guess you could say the skit was about dissatisfied 
people talking about going to a mythically wonderful place.  According to 
rumor.  Nothing bad was said about the shire - but nothing really 
wonderful was said either."

This being the case, there was still some group of gentles who managed
to misinterpret this drastically, and these were the folks who spoke to
the Isenfiri about the skit.  Efforts to procure a copy of the script
at Pennsic came up empty-handed.  What were these shire-folk supposed
to think?  What would any of us have done in their place?  I agree that 
they take their group seriously, and if they didn't they probably wouldn't
have gotten so upset.  So maybe it would be a good thing for groups to
be less touchy in general.  But, given that they are . . .

This could have been avoided if SCA-TV had sought permission from
Isenfir to use its name, and showed them a copy of the script in
advance.  Then the shire would have KNOWN what the skit contained,
and the unfortunate occurence of hearing a distorted version at second
hand wouldn't have done any damage.  (Of course, this argument could be
taken to extremes--imagine if you had to ask the permission of any
Kingdom in order to mention their name in a creative work.  But still I
think I have a point.)

Laurie is correct in surmising that I referred to Veleda.  The point
about Lady Tudor Glitz is well-taken.  L.T-G. only uses real names with
the permission of the person involved, by the way.  (I should also add
that Veleda mostly-draws and partly-writes L. T-G.   Bronwyn
Jourdemaine mostly-writes and partly-designs drawings for it.  Just to
keep the credits straight. ;-)

I am also informed that an apology was printed in the Pennsic Daily
Tidings.  Both Marji and the Isenfiri have now informed me of this, but
I didn't know it before.  As this is the case, I am sorry I suggested 
that Merowald hasn't been conscientious enough.  However, none of the
Shire folk have (as of today Sept 16) yet received a script from him,
which is something he agreed at Pennsic to send.

The Isenfiri (although they'd still like to see a script or videotape)
have calmed down and hope to get the misunderstanding cleared up.
I am working with Marji to make this happen, so that everyone involved 
can agree that no malice whatsoever was intended.

I apologize for jumping the gun and possible setting a bad example
myself.

Well, what other conclusion could you draw (even if it is only 
Saskatchawan)? :-)

BTW, on the subject of our new Crown Prince:  this was the first Crown 
Tourney that I've witnessed, but by all accounts I heard, this Crown was 
especially hard fought and hard won.  Many fine and glorious battles were
fought, with quite a few spectacular "deaths".  The fighter's ranks trimmed
quickly, with many a favorite destined to return and try again next spring.
Finally, as things wore on, the fights became more and more even.  Duke Erik
and Sir Torkil Kana (sp? as always) fought for over 30 minutes in one bout
of the semi-finals during the (~90 degree) heat of the afternoon.  Torkil 
was legged during a good portion of that bout, which ended up lengthening 
things considerably.  They both made it to the final round, which started
as the sun was beginning to set.  For much of that round, it seemed that 
Erik must have had a shield on one hand and swords in the the other three;
similarly Torkil was amazing in his defense, and delivered more than a few 
resounding blows on his opponent.  

The finals were the best two out of three at His Majesty's request.  Erik 
won the first round, Torkil the second, and, after a long and very 
fast-moving battle (especially considering how tired these two must have 
been), Erik took the third as well.  

At the Investiture Court that evening, both contestants were praised 
mightily by the populace.  After Erik's being crowned prince and Torkil's 
award of the Silver Rose, Erik also made Torkil the Queen's Champion, a
position that Erik had held, but felt unfitting that the Crown Prince 
should hold both offices.  Needless to say, the crowd was quite pleased
at both the chivalry and honor shown by and to these great fighters.  
Feelings of loyalty to one or the other ran deep in many there it seems, 
and both were shown much honor and praise, as they rightly deserved.

Subject: boar hunts & bouzkashi
Message-ID: <443810.880915.CENT@AI.AI.MIT.EDU>

As no one else has stepped forward, I suppose I ought to mention the
nearly-annual Bear/Boar Hunt held in the Shire of Bergental (Amherst, MA
area).  The conduct is similar to what some gentle recently described as
that of a boar hunt held in the Mists.
    The event is held in early Dec. in a small piece of marshy forest
adjacent to one of the local colleges.  A couple good fighters are detailed
to be boars (two sword) -- I think bears, if any, get to use polearm, but I
could be mis-remembering.  The hunters may get choice of weapons, or only
spears -- I fear I don't recall.  Non-combatants may be hounds, who can run
around in the woods and bark, and sometimes point, but may not speak.
Sometimes there is a Master of Hounds who is allowed to interpret what the
hounds indicate, or at least helps direct the hounds in their running.
Hounds are killed like scouts.
    Often there are traces of snow on the ground, which doesn't provide as
much help as one might expect in tracking; the boars are allowed 5 or 10
minutes lead time into the forest, during which they may backtrack,
sidetrack, and otherwise lay confusing trails.  I recall that once a boar
removed a few of his outer garments and carefully arrayed them on a small
tree to confuse the hounds.  The hunt ends when either all the boars or all
the hunters are dead.
    This tends to be a small event (in the Dec. wet and cold, after all),
so usually there are a couple consecutive hunts, until people get frozen
and want to go inside.  Of course, after the first run the tracks get
muddled and confusing.  Eventually everyone is thoroughly chilled and we
all remove to a local church for a feast, dancing, story-telling, etc.,
sometimes (given the season) including a Yule cake which results in a brief
reign by a King of Misrule.  As I recall, any hunter who kills a boar is
awarded a small prize, as are, occasionally, outstanding hounds.

    As to bouzkashi (spelling?), I was also introduced to that in
Bergental.  The tale I was told concerning the game went something like
this: Bouzkashi is the Afghan national game.  They play it on horseback,
using a dead sheep as the token.  The point of the game is to carry the
sheep along a pre-determined closed route (e.g. "through those two
villages, over the pass, behind that mountain, along the river, and back
here"), which may take several days.  The meta-point is to gain honor by
carrying the sheep for some length of time -- the longer, the more honor,
of course; the most honor is garnered by he who returns the sheep to the
designated end after it has been carried the whole route, at which time he
is supposed to throw the sheep down and yell something, perhaps the word
"bouzkashi" -- at least that would explain the name.  Men play in teams,
and teams pass the sheep back and forth among their members so that honor
may be spread to all.  The teams try to steal the sheep from each other,
for the sake of the honor of carrying it, which leads to disputes; guns
were outlawed, or so I was told, in about 1945.
    In Bergental, bouzkashi is played thusly: the token is a fuzzy stuffed
sheep about 2 ft. long.  A field is chosen and 3 flat shields are laid out
on it in a line about 50 ft. apart.  All fighters who wish to play armor up
and gather in a circle around the middle shield.  A marshall throws the
sheep into the air and then steps back quickly as the fighters close in.
The route the sheep must take is around both end shields, in either order,
and then back to the middle.  Fighters die in usual SCA fashion, but there
is a resurrection point set up -- a place a small distance away from the
field where a fighter must stand a minute, or a lady whose hand must be
kissed, or something such; after which act the fighter may return to the
fray.  As one might expect, it's harder to carry the sheep than it is to
attack the carrier, since the carrier must hang onto the sheep somehow, so
is usually reduced to one-handed defense.  Everyone gains much honor, and
in the end the sheep must be placed upon the middle shield by the fighter
who gains the highest honor -- that is, s/he must have a hand on it rather
than throwing it.
    A non-fighting variation is also played, with unarmored people and
kills by two-handed tag, and a resurrection point..

SCA-TV was very entertaining; I especially liked the "new and used heraldry"

Subject: Dance at Pennsic

In digest 109, Henry of Maldon says:

       That's worse than it sounds.  To the best of my knowledge, "Hole in
  the Wall" and "Strip the Willow" are relatively recent (post 17th c.) and
  "Belle Qui Tiens Ma Vie" was choreographed in the SCA (this version of
  the Pavan is not in _Orchesography_, which is where the music is from.
  Also, "Belle Qui" was originally *vocal* music ,not instrumental.  And as
  for "Korobushka," that dance was first done by Russian-Americans in the
  1940s, then became popular among folk dancers in a slightly altered form,
  and was then rechoreographed again when it came into the SCA.  And to think
  that I used to believe people when they said the SCA was primarily about
  the Middle Ages...

  Henry of Maldon (alias Alex Clark)

  No matter what kind of garb you wear, if you don't care for research and
  don't want to do anything that's really Medieval you're a Mundane.
----------
For the first part, you're pretty much right. "Hole in the Wall" is early
Baroque; "Strip the Willow", as far as I can tell, is an SCA invention,
although it might be later English Country; "Korobushka" is modern folk;
and the "Belle Qui" pavane was, I believe, invented in Carolingia, although
it is pretty close to some of the "real" ones. (And is a heck of a lot 
*prettier* as a vocal piece, as well as more period).

The problem, as far as I can tell, is that there isn't much communication
going on of the dances that are both period and fun. Also, a lot of people
just don't *know* that the dances aren't period. (This extends into Mundania,
too; one friend tells me of going to a Mundane dance class, and being taught
that same Belle Qui pavane as being around a thousand years old. The reason
for this conclusion? Well, it's Carolingian, isn't it?). This same lack of
communication is the reason that I'm pushing for this Dance Newsletter; I'll
be calling the lady who volunteered to run it this afternoon (given how loaded
I am, it's far more likely to actually happen if somebody else does the hard
work...).

As for being mundane if you don't do it right; have a heart. In re-creating
the entire Middle Ages, we've taken on a pretty broad charter. No one can
do everything right. Those of us who are first and foremost dancers can
complain all we want about everyone else doing it wrong, but, unless we're
prepared to back it up by helping everyone else do it right, it smacks of
hypocrisy. If they're not being period, teach them how to do it right,
don't just yell, "That's not period!". (This isn't meant to be a flame;
I'm just a little touchy on that point).

Subject: On politics, humor, and authenticity

I am definitely of the opinion that many people take themselves and
their position in the Society too seriously.  I do not, based on what 
I recall of Lady Marion Greenleaf's correspondence, think she is one of
them.  There are a great many people who take offense at the least
implication that the huge golden spiked frisbee they wear as token
of rank plus fifty cents may buy them a cup of coffee.  I think that 
in this case, the shire of Isenfir has a very legitimate beef.  Being
from far away (farther away than those who put on the skit), I had
thought Isenfir to be mythical. (I didn't see the skit, but heard the 
laughter from my encampment) I have a suspicion that Lady Marion's 
merchant friend may be Veleda of Isenfir, whom I think is a person
unlikely to take the SCA too seriously (She *does* write Lady Tudor 
Glitz, after all).  I have no idea how Isenfir can get an apology or
retraction, but my good wishes go out to them.  Say, Isn't Duke 
Merowald the guy who puts out the maps of the Known World?  Shouldn't 
he know that this was a real shire he was talking about?  Now, I have
nothing against political satire in the SCA (I do live right next to
the Westermark, which has a tradition of putting on the same sort of 
political skits and plays), but I think they really ought to invent 
names that protect the not-so-innocent without mangling somebody else's 
reputation.       As I also don't want to mangle Merowald's reputation,
I will say that I really don't think it was malicious.  I met in passing 
someone who I think was him -- very nice armor and a green surcote with
his arms in escutcheons -- and got a very good impression.  [Gads,
Pennsic has really given me an 'interkingdom' perspective; It's neat 
to know who people are discussing four kingdoms away]

At a pandybat competition held several years ago in the West, Duke Torgul 
Steingrimmson brought a thrusting codpiece to the field.  The marshall who 
inspected him wouldn't let Torgul fight with it, so Torgul converted it to a
thrusting breastplate on the spot and fought that way.  Looked pretty funny 
and worked better as a breastplate, too.

     That's worse than it sounds.  To the best of my knowledge, "Hole in
the Wall" and "Strip the Willow" are relatively recent (post 17th c.) and
"Belle Qui Tiens Ma Vie" was choreographed in the SCA (this version of
the Pavan is not in _Orchesography_, which is where the music is from.
Also, "Belle Qui" was originally *vocal* music ,not instrumental.  And as
for "Korobushka," that dance was first done by Russian-Americans in the
1940s, then became popular among folk dancers in a slightly altered form,
and was then rechoreographed again when it came into the SCA.  And to think
that I used to believe people when they said the SCA was primarily about
the Middle Ages...

Message-Id: <2982@pt.cs.cmu.edu>


I talked to the Autocrat for the Pennsic war today and informed him of the
specifics of the pestilence that has been contacted by several people from
the Pennsic swimming hole.  After spending real money to call long distance
to NJ and he doing the same I think we can halt the tendency for it to be
said this is just a rumor or someone elses problem.

The bad part of it is that he wants me to write a letter to the Chiurgeon of
the East and inform him of the matter.  I hate USnail.  If anyone knows Lord
Ragnusson and could get a note to him for me, I'd be very grateful.

Please, above all else, take this seriously.  There really was a bug in the
water.  It is a real protozoan and worst of all it is very hard to detect by
normal testing cultures because it frequently tests negative even though you
still have NGU type symptoms.  The disease only responds to a drug known as
Flagel which a man must take for 24 hours and a woman for 7 days (sorry
ladies).  Prior to taking the Flagel you are supposed to take some form of
standard antibiotic because apparently the little pest sometimes brings
other fun stuff along with it.  The schedule is one week of antibiotic,
begin the Flagel then also add another week of antibiotic.  After that you
should be free of just about any known Sexually Transmitted or Urinary
disease short of Aids or Herpes.

See my previous posts on the pestilence if you want more info.  If I can get
hold of the Chiurgeon you will be seeing an article in the Pikestaff about
it.

Sorry to keep harping on this but someone has to and I seem to be the only
one who will act responsibly about it.

Subject:  Hypothesis: Sense of humor is inversely proportional to Level of Po...

Lady marion greenleef was complaining about a skit (SCA-TV) which she ha never
seen and complaining that it was making fun of some shire. Having neither met
anyone from that shire nor having seen the skit I am not qualified to say one
way or the other, but since I haven't posted in a while I thought I would make
your a basic statement which may or may not have any relevence to that matter.
Most shires take themselves too seriously, they loose their sense of humor,
there are some marvellous traditions in the SCA, most of them inherently
irreverent. One aspect of the society that almost no-one likes is politics and
feel that the major source of politics (at least the bad politics) is from
people, shires, baronies etc. taking them selves too seriously. The best part
about the society is the amount of fun possible, but things like people
bickering about who did what to whom and others yelling "that's not period"
about every little thing that wasn't actually made befor 1600 A.D. can drag us
under.

I recently captured and printed several messages from alt.sca and took

created much interest, particularly from our Seneschal, who immediately
spread the news of the "Pensic Pestilence", and our Dance Mistress, who
was very excited over the messages discussing music and dancing.  It is

30 lb. bows: 
The bows used for combat archery are 30 lb. pull, quite often they
are a common cheap beginner's bow, known as 'Irish Sping' bows
because of the green and white striping. There are a few homebuilt
or modified crossbows around also.

boar hunts:
I can't speak definitively on boar hunts, only from the experience
I have had. I was the boar for the boar hunt held for then Princess
Maythen, at Mills College in Oakland (the Mists). The area where it
was held was the semi-wilderness behind the hall, which consisted of
a drained lake (2 ft deep mud), trees, small gullies with streams, and
lots of blackberry bushes. As the boar, I was armed with 2 short swords
with thrusting tips, the hunters had spears. Non-fighters and children
were hounds, who could only bark when they spotted me, no talking or
pointing. The hunters stayed in groups large enough that I could not
safely attack, so I spent 2 hours running! At last the princess and her
group caught up with me, I turned and managed to kill her, but slipped
while trying to get away. I was mercilessly speared to the ground.
At court that evening, a beautiful account of the hunt was given, the
gallantry of the hunters, the cunning of the boar, the gore as the boar
savaged the body of the brave princess, etc. in flowing bardic style.
I was then presented with an AA, much to my surprise. Definitely one of
my treasured SCA memories. I haven't heard of any other boar hunts in
the area since, maybe I should instigate.

	I think I would simply, at this point, when we have no firm 
description of the individual, report it to the Tuchuqs.  Tell them that
this persons action has endangered thier welcome at the war in the future.
I think that, from what little I have seen of the chuqs, thier own 
disipline on the individual ( and I'm also reasonably sure that they know
who it was too) would be as effective as our own.  This doesn't help the
scout, but it should make things safer.
	As for helping more, the event happened in the woods below the hill 
that the Calontiri shield wall was on.  Judging from other accounts of the
battle, these would be remnants of the Tuchuq attack on the Calantir forces
who were reliesed during the hold.  They say that one in battle counts every
foeman twice, but I would guess that there were about 4 to 6 of them down that
far.  Again, if you can check with Septemptria, they were lined up about 10-15
yards away and may have seen more than I did.

According to the Kingdom Chiurgeon of the West who went and polled the
monarchs the total present at the field battle was roughtly 1200, about
600 per side.  The false start was not due to confusion between the
marshalls and the cannoneers but on the part of myself.  The woods
battle also had about 1200. For historical comparisons John of Gaunt
took about 500 with him to Portugal when he sought to intervene in
the struggle for the succession.

At one Commoner's Crown there was a competition for SCA legal weapons based
on objects a peasant might use as a means of defense when attacked by raiders.
My entry was a carefully padded chamberpot, covered in (what else) duct tape.
There were other equally weird things.  At this year's event in Rivenstar
(Middle) there was a barroom melee in which coat-racks, brooms, chairs, etc,
were made by the participants and used in a melee - apparently fun (I wasn't
there) because it was repeated at least once.  The weapons had to meet normal
standards for the Kingdom in addition to being reasonable replicas of the
objects that might be pressed into use in such a fight.

    The last population figures that I heard for the East placed you
    all with about 1200-1400 people.  That`s 4 or principalities (250
    minimum membership) or 3 kingdoms (400 minimum membership.)

The population of the East is closing in on 2000.  The East Kingdom newsletter
(Pikestaff) has a circulation of 2100, and about 10% are out of kingdom.

You only need 100 people for a Principality, though 400 for a Kingdom is
correct.  The East could easily be 5 Kingdoms.

I am currently working on an event very much like what you have descibed. It is
tentatively set for late April and will be an interbaronial war between
the Barony Marche of the Debatable Lands (East Kingdom) and Barony of the 
Middle Marches (Middle Kingdom). It is still to early to give any real 
specifics but the Barons, Baronial Seneschals, and the Middle Kingdom 
Seneschal have all given their stamps of approval. 
	I would be interested in finding out how well small wars like this 
have worked out in other areas. Specifically relating to the multi-kingdom
nature of this event, but still retaining the inter-Baronial feel.


P.S. Thanks for all of the feedback on my "not so perfect" recollection of
the known world. O.K. so I kind of switched Trimaris and Meridies, no one
can be perfect (even Heralds ;-)

Subject: SCA TV--the trashing of "Isenfir"
Message-Id: <590087088/kee@A.NL.CS.CMU.EDU>

I only saw Merowald's SCA-TV stuff in passing through, but some of the
fallout from it sort of landed on me.

For two and a half years, I lived in the area of the Shire of Isenfir,
in Atlantia (Charlottesville, VA) and still retain close ties there.  I
can vouch for the friendliness, talent and overall good-times attitude
of its citizens.  The place is pretty apolitical and laid back, with a
lot going on in the arts and sciences, and currently one authorized
fighter, though I understand they are trying to improve on that.

During the final weekend at Pennsic, I visited my Isenfiri friends and
found them rather distraught.  Apparently SCA-TV had presented a skit
"a clef", with thinly-disguised portrayals of certain political
situations.  The skit (which apparently seemed to refer to certain
situations in Trimaris, actually) was set in a take-off on the kingdom
of Atlantia, with parody names for the King and Queen, etc.  Most
unfortunately, the skit portrayed a shire full of nasty political
characters, and this shire was "disguised" by borrowing the name of
ANOTHER, ACTUAL shire for it.  The name that was picked was "Isenfir."

The day after this entertainment was presented, one of my friends from
Isenfir, a merchant, made a sale to some folk from one of the kingdoms
which is not on the East Coast (I have forgotten which one).  During
the transaction, on discovering where the merchant was from, the
customers said, "Isenfir?  Why, that's a terrible place!  Full of nasty
people!" (or words to that effect) and it turned out that they "knew
all about it" from having seen the SCA-TV skit.

This led the folk of the shire to make inquiries, and on finding out
what had happened--none of them had been present at the
performance--they got pretty upset.  My friend the merchant sought out
Merowald, who appeared to be extremely cavalier about the whole thing.
He said that the name had been chosen "at random".  If so, it was a
very discourteous thing to do--what they should have done was made up a
name, and then checked to make sure it WASN'T the name of any real
group.  Anyway, it was at this point in the chain of events that I came
visiting at the Insenfir encampment and found the shire members quite
upset, and wondering what they could do to repair the damage to their
shire's reputation.

The shire is now trying to locate a videotape of the performance, so if
anyone has it on tape and is willing to make a copy (extra tape
provided), please let me know via email.   The reason for this is that
without a tape or a copy of the script, the Isenfiri are not sure how
bad it really was, and they are worried that they may be overreacting.
(Although, given the impression which it apparently made on my friend's
customers, I think they have reason to be upset.)

A formal apology (in writing) from Merowald and whoever else may have
been responsible is, in my opinion, certainly in order.  Perhaps making
this posting on the net will help to repair whatever other damage may
have been done to Isenfir's reputation.  I don't want to appear
interfering, but I think this was a pretty serious gaffe and a little
consideration and forethought would have prevented it altogether.
I am pretty surprised that Merowald let this happen; in his defense, I
must say this is the first bad thing I have ever heard about him!

Subject: bows

*sigh*
i will now attempt to set forth clearly my views on archery and combat 
archery

1) the weight of the bow a person should use depends chiefly on his/her 
(hereinafter reffered to in the masculine) strength and endurance.  Thirty 
lbs. is a good weight for many people.  Children generally start with lighter 
bows--20 lb. and under and can achieve very good accuracy with them.  Archery 
at the nearer distances is one sca activity that should make no distictions in 
age, size, or strength.
HOWEVER, using a bow that bends in one's hands like cooked lasagna noodles is 
an excellent approximation of a waste of time, leading to frustration and 
irritation rather than satisfaction.  I was persuaded to use an 18 lb bow for 
one entire season, and was vaugly unhappy untill  i figured out that the 
excessivly light weight of the bow was bothering me and switched to a 25 lb 
bow, which was still a bit light, but much better.  by that time, i had 
essentialy wasted the entire summer and received an insult that i shall not 
soon forgive.
CONCLUSION the weight of bow that a person should use depends on the 
individual.  people who should be using 30 lb and under bows should use them.  
For people who can consistantly pull a heavier weight, 30 lbs is ridiculous.
2)  arguments against combat archery.
2a)  safety.  friend a is the daughter of a opthomologis and feels sick just 
thinking about anything that has a remote chance of puting out some ones eyes. 
most of the archers i know are somewhat safty-overconcious, this is usually a 
good thing.  In this case, i suspect that resonable caution is all that is 
necsessary.  Required qualification is, of course, a good idea--using the bows 
and 'arows' that would be used; there is very little relation between a 
person's ability to shoot archery and his ability to shoot combat archery.
2b) bow weight.  see above. this is freind b's objection (i think he pulls
a 50 lb. bow.)
2c) the reason *i* wont do it--I just don't like shooting people.  In fact, i 
don't like shooting pictures or silhouetts of people.  i can't help it, i'm 
wierd
2d) the reason i don't wan't to see it on the field--I don't think it belongs 
there.  Medievaly warfare archery is inherantly long distance.  Short range is 
more reminisant of cow-boys and indians than anything in period i can think 
of.  That is why i reccommend bunny-hunts.  It gives a plausible reason for 
sneeking up close to something before skewering it, and therefore appropriate 
to combat archery, and it is g*dawfull *silly*, and therefore appropriate to 
combat archery.

The Carolingia/Quintavia Boredom War, which happens in early June
seems to draw 200 some odd (some very odd) people.  I seem to recall
that the Stonemarch/Malegentia (S & M) War drew slightly less than
that number a month later, but I never saw the troll figures for that
one (I did for the Boredom War, but I've long since forgotten them).
I have a feeling that earlier wars might draw lesser numbers, because
people are more reluctant to travel before the summer, and many
students will have finals.  But Allah alone knows all.

	There are, if I`m not mistaken, several principalities in the known
world that have no intention of ever becoming kingdoms.  Cynagua and the Mists
in West, the Sun (does it still exist?) in Atenveldt...   There may be others,
but these I'm relativly certain of.  

	So why become a confederation of Kingdoms, when you can be a Kingdom 
that is a union of principalities?  The last population figures that I heard
for the East placed you all with about 1200-1400 people.  That`s 4 or 5
principalities (250 minimum membership) or 3 kingdoms (400 minimum membership.)
(By contrast, I believe that the Middle has about 800 members.  With our 
Canadian Principality that leaves us with something like 500 members remaining,
enough for a couple of coronets in the states (if someone could figure out how
to divide it.)  

	Personally, I like the idea of several principalities within a 
kingdom.  It's a pipe dream to think that it would reduce the beaurachracy
(I know I misspelled that, but I hate the word anyway  :-), but it would 
make the lines a little more obvious.  As someone from the East has pointed 
out, it would make the recognition of deserving gentles easier, and would
make the intra-kingdom war a possibility (since baronial wars don't seem too
popular up here...  :-), and small wars are almost as much fun as the big one.

	I don't think that being Coronet is that much less work than Crown to 
attract a *lot* more fighters, but certainly the lessened travel requirements
would help, and, coronet tourneys would seem to be the ideal place to try 
some of the alternate methods for running a crown tourney that we've discussed
on here.  Light lists?  Field battles with vassal armies?  Whatever, a coronet
would seem to be the place to try it.  

	And, if one principality does get large enough, and different enough 
to split off, we could even have rebelions...  complete with foriegn
allies and mercinaries.  :-)

	Enough!  I'll let everyone else get a word in...

     As of about 1 1/2 years ago, the East had nearly 1500 members and
the Middle and West had a bit over a thousand each.
     Did they raise the membership requirement for principalities?
I don't remember it.

     How about this: divide the East Kingdom into six or seven
Principalities (including Drachenwald).  After the investiture of all
the Princes & Princesses, have a crown tournament, in which each
principality's army fights for its Prince and Princess!

May Allah, the Compassionate, the Mericful grant you all peace.  

For those of you who have no interest in non-SCA events, or cannot
attend events on the East coast in the upcomming month, I appologize
for filling your mail box with useless information.  Delete this
message now.

For those of you who are still with me, I would like to tell you about
an upcomming event which is not SCA, but I think will have interest
for many SCA people, as it is an interactive story whose setting is in
the 1001 Nights, and hence takes place within period times.  

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It is written, but Allah is All-knowing, that Yusif the Carpenter had
a difficult decision to make.  He did not know whether he should first
complete the treasure chest for the Sultan, or complete the bed for
the beautiful Widow, Murwarreed.  Should he follow the instructions
of Ahmed the Thief when constructing the chest? On the other hand, he could
travel with the alchemist, Abul 'as-Saraar, to visit that strange cave
he had heard so much about.  Or perhaps he should just sell his shop,
and set out to sea. . . .


The Society for Interactive Literature invites you to take part in

                        The Arabian Nights

An Interactive Adventure for 200 (and 1) Role-Players

             October 7-9, 1988    o   Morristown, New Jersey 

Come take on the persona of one of the characters from the famous
tales with which Shahrazad entertained the Sultan for 1001 Nights, or
become one of the myriad people who inhabited Baghdad during the
reign of Haroon ar-Rasheed.  Travel to exotic foreign ports and trade
for a fortune in rare treasures, stay in Baghdad and hobnob with
the Khalifah, or huddle with the beggars and thieves in the street.
All this happens in a world where magic and adventure lie around every
corner, where you could become the Wazeer to a Sultan or be whisked away
to some desolate spot by an evil Magian fire-worshipper.   The
Arabian Nights} will be an imaginative adaptation of the famous
Burton and Lane translations of the Thousand Nights and a
Night, with all the plot determined by your interactions with other
players. 

The Arabian Nights will be played in three days, from Friday
to Sunday.  On Friday night, you receive sheets describing your
history, setting and character, and learn game mechanism for combat,
trading, magic and other strange customs.  On Saturday, you use your
own abilities in acting, politicking, begging and trading (with other
players, not the gamemasters) to try to achieve goals you set for
yourself.  You can also go to the Storytellers, who will launch you
into a tale within a tale to provide aid for you quest.  But mostly,
you have the fun of creating your own story for a weekend by playing
with 200 other characters like yourself, and whether you become a
Sultan or a Beggar, you'll have 1001 tales to tell about the game
afterwards.

The Arabian Nights will take place on the the weekend of October 7-9,
in the Headquarters Plaza Hotel, in Morristown, New Jersey (Just off
I-287 and convenient to NJTransit commuter rail).  Cost for the game
will be $30 and includes a complete character.  A costuming and
background guide will be mailed out well in advance of the game,
giving you sufficient time to prepare for the costume competition.
Hotel rooms are extra and will run $60-65 per night.  For more
information, including registration forms, send your name and address
to: 
	The Society for Interactive Literature}

Or else call us at (617) 623-0133, or e-mail `almond@hustat.harvard.edu'.   
We are always happy to discuss what it is that we do, and plans for
upcoming events.

Merchant Inquiries Welcome.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Needless to say, I am heavily involved in this project and will be
happy to answer any question about it.  The main way in which this
differs from an SCA event, is that you will be handed a packet
describing your personna at the door, rather than developing it your
self after long years of research.   Please feel free to mail me

what did you think of it?  Duke Syr Merowald is definitely thinking of doing
another show next War and/or perhaps a traveling show as well, something
akin to taking one of the Cooper's tractor-flats and driving it around camp,

RE Silly Weapons: Thanks to all those gentles who have elaborated
on this subject in response to my request. I'm sure the Baron will
be pleased with the information!

RE Email: Things don't work as they should. Those on the net who have
sent email to me and did not receive a reply should know that I always
attempt to answer all mail, but many letters are returned by mailer
daemons, marked "host unknown" or "unknown user" etcetera. I have just
about exhausted my supply of alternate addresses.

RE Archery: Malice writes that SCA combat archery is done with things
that look like bows but only pull 30 pounds or so. This seems to imply
that a bow of that trength is not a *real bow* - is that what you mean,
Malice?
In my local archery club, 30-pounders are called "ladie's bows" and are
used by those who aren't very muscular. But they certainly are conside-
red *bows*, and they are used at competitions, too. How strong your bow
should be depends on you. A not so strong person will shoot much better
with a 30-pounder than with a 40-pounder. In my opinion, a 30-pounder
is just about perfect for a beginner. And as a weapon, it is definitely
lethal. An arrow from such a bow will go straight through an unarmored
human at distances up to 75 meters, maybe more (I haven't tried this,
but it's obvious from the depth of impact on targets).

RE Cattle at Pennsic: Would somebody please explain to an ignorant
foreigner about this. It seems like people have been stealing cows
from each other at the War. Is this a Wild West group? Do people
actually bring cattle to the War? How can you fit your cows into
your cars? I don't think one would fit into my Honda, but perhaps
you Americans all drive very big cars with a cowhouse attached?

RE Boar Hunt: Please explain this too! Does anyone have Rules for such
fights? I would like to see them.

I've just been wondering about how well attended an early to late spring
event along the lines of a war might be.  I personally think it would be a
great way to warm up for Pennsic.  One reason I ask is that I know this nice
large patch ( >100 acres) of woods and fields that my uncle owns and doesn't
use for much.  It has a fairly large barn that is empty too, for possible
dancing type stuff.

Any ideas?

 by Jack Chalker and re-posted it without permission to SF-Lovers in
 violation of the copyrights of both that article and OtherRealms.]

Here's the final update on the Jack Chalker copyright fiasco. I had the
opportunity to discuss it with Jack at Nolacon, and everything seems to have
been worked out. Saul Jaffe (moderator of the ARPA side of SF-L) was good
enough to not redistribute the violating material to the ARPA digests, so
the violation was limited to the USENET group. 

Jack's position is that since the reposting included his copyright notice it
doesn't impact his copyright on the material (it does violate the copyright,
but it does not put it in the public domain) so he's happy with the steps
that were taken and willing to drop things as they stand. He also points out
that the bibliography is available for publication, free, on request. Just
ask him (if you want to contact him, you can do it through me). The reasons
he has it copyrighted are:

	o He wants to know where it's being published.

	o He wants to guarantee that what is being published is what he
	  really said, not what someone else decided to write into his
	  mouth -- this becomes important because there is commentary in
	  that article as well as normal bibliographic information.

Since there was a meta-discussion about why someone would copyright a
bibliography in the first place (irrelavent to the situation but an
interesting discussion) I thought I'd pass along his reasoning.

So as far as Jack and I are concerned, the situation is over and the
problems resolved as well as they can be. It doesn't obviate the fact that
the copyright violation occurred, but everyone's satisfied it didn't do any
lasting harm to any of the parties involved. However, the net NEEDS to get
its act together and be more careful about stuff like this. Include the
standard rhetoric about paying attention to laws and things here -- I won't
bore you.

On related matters: I've had the OtherRealms fanzine archive-server disabled
until I could resolve this issue and decide whether or not the
archive-server itself violated copyright (was it really distributing
back-issues? Or was it actually republishing?) The question isn't
definitively answered and probably won't be any time soon, but because it's
distributing the original issues as is rather than individual articles, my
feeling (and the feeling of most of the people I've talked to about it) is
that it is best defined as a back-issue delivery service. 

Because of this, I've re-enabled the archive server, and you can now get
OtherRealms back issues again. Sorry for any inconveniences this might have
caused people. 

Finally, a couple of quick words about copyrights and OtherRealms. I
ran into a number of people at Nolacon who were getting bits and pieces
of OtherRealms -- with both the copyright and the my address stripped
off of them.

Besides the fact that this modification of OtherRealms violates the
copyright of the publication (which is a no-no!), stripping off the address
meant that those folks who got the modified version had no way of finding me
and getting the entire magazine. I'm going to be working with some of these
people to try to backtrack to the source of their copies (networks can be a
royal pain sometimes) but a general comment to people who redistribute
OtherRealms elsewhere:

	If you redistribute it, you must leave the copyright notices AND the
	my network and mail addresses on each part of the electronic issue.
	You're welcome to take parts of the issue if you don't want to
	redistribute the whole thing, but do NOT modify any part of subset
	the pieces in any way. You can not, for instance, simply take an
	article, strip the coprights, address or header information. Those
	are all violations of my copyright, and if I find you doing it,
	we'll be having words.

You may not think this is all very important, but it is. Why?

	o if I can't guarantee the copyright of my authors, my authors will
	  ask me to not publish their works electronically. If I don't
	  publish it electronically you don't get to see it.

	o if I can't guarantee my own copyrights, the future of OtherRealms
	  on the net is put in doubt. If I can't protect my work on the
	  net, I'll have to protect it by pulling it. This is something I'd
	  much rather avoid.

	o if you strip off the identifying information, the people who get
  	  it after you may inadvertantly violate copyright. That puts them
	  AND you at a legal liability.

	o if you strip the address information, people who want to get ahold
	  of me for submissions or subscriptions can't. You may have saved
	  yourself a thousand bytes or so, but you cause problems to the
	  people who get it from you later. 

Please. OtherRealms is a service I give the net happily. But if it gets
screwed up by others, I'll have to protect it and myself. I want to avoid
this, because nobody wins. I'm going to be rewording and copyrights and
re-arrannging the next issue of the electronic OtherRealms to make this more
explicit, but if people use a little common sense we can avoid problems.

To everyone I met in New Orleans, thanks! It was a jazz to sit and talk to
the folks who read OtherRealms -- the feedback and friendship makes the work
more than worthwhile!

Subject: Need safety specifications for armor construction
Message-Id: <867MICHAEL@MAINE>

I am considering making myself some armor and though I have an idea of what
I want to do, I need specific information about current safety requirements
of armor. Specifically, I need to know EXACTLY which areas must be specially
protected (such as back of neck, groin, sternum, other less obvious places),
and what is the standard used to determine "sufficient" protection?

What I am thinking of doing is constructing a tunic of soft leather into which
I will sew reinforcing pieces of stiff leather or cuirbolli. Over this, I would
wear a chain mail coat to midthigh with bicep-length sleeves. For protection
of the legs and arms, either cuirbolli or steel. On the feet, period-looking
(or at least, archaic looking) boots with steel toes. And, naturally, a
suitable helm, possibly with a chain mail coif.

Any accurate information or pointers to where I can find it would be
appreciated.

Actually, the range of events (geographic that is) is pretty well spread 
out. It just happened that three major events happened/will happen 
in Adiantum this year: Egil's (Adiantium's major event), An Tir/West 
(located there because it was central between the two Kingdoms), and 

September Crown (which moves around every year).
 
One idea is to post the calendars for each Kingdom here. I have one 
online (I maintain it for my BBS) and could post the An Tir calendar 
here monthly, anyone think that might be a good idea? (It would let 
travelers know if something was going to happen where they are visiting 
for other reasons...)

An Tir will _probably_ get Saskatchwan as part of its lands. It has

Author's Query

Hello.  I am a writer, working on a book about organizing nonprofit 
special events.  This is a nuts-and-bolts approach for volunteers and 
others who are trying to put together church bazaars, academic 
conferences, PTA meetings, town fairs, ethnic festivals, lecture 
series, concerts ... you get the idea.

I am hoping for your ideas, opinions, and experiences.  If you have
done this sort of event in the past, let me know your tricks, etc.
If you are just beginning, tell me what sort of questions you
have?

Here's the table of contents.  I'm working on deadline (the book 
will be published in April, 1989) so please contact me as soon as
possible if you're able to help.

Thank you in advance for your help.

P.S. I'm especially interested in groups from states other than
my own (Massachusetts), and groups other than the SCA, (I think
that our "Autocrat's Handbook" pretty much covers the subject
for the SCA, though I am always ready to chat about SCA events).

Um....  In this area of the East (NY, NJ, and Eastern PA), the term I have
heard (and use) for great weapons/two weapons is _funny_ weapons, not silly
weapons. A man without a sheild looks funny (dangerous, too!), not silly
(except maybe Viktor and his "think of it as a fashion statement" pole-arm). 
Although, come to think of it, it is kind of silly to face a 3'X5' 4 pound
heater shield (only a slight exageration) with a 3.5' bastard sword, or even
my Middle Kingdom Crown legal 25'' target. 

As for a silly weapons tourny, I would love to see one. The Pandybat and
Barroom brawl (Why didn't Christopher teach that at Dance Class?) both sound
like a HOOT! The closest I've seen are a Sir Gawain Melee (but now that many
kingdoms have combat archery, this wouldn't be as interesting) and Bous-kashee

anyone is interested.

Subject: silly weapons

I think that M. Arval is confused.  It is true that at one time anything other
than sword and shield was considered "unusual" and the Order of the Tigers 
Combatant was, for a while, used for excellence in "unusual" or "non-standard" 
weapons forms (e.g. Master Kobayashi for katana, Baroness Morgan for army), 
but the pre-eminance of sword and shield was rapidly becoming past history 
when i entered the socioty 9 years ago.  Anyone who wishes to refer to katana, 
or hablberd, or two sword as "silly weapons" would be well advised to fight 
one of those forms himself.

I would like to mention Bergental's annual "Crestfallen Tourney"  This is 
faught with perfectly normal weapons, but the rules are differen.  Everyone 
wears a crest on his(her hereinafter refered to in the masculine) helm and the 
object of any bout is to knock one's opponant's crest off, or at least 
significantly reduce its profile.  Since *only* head shots count, the fighting 
strategy is, um, unusual.  Prizes not only to the winner but also to the 
neatest crest.  some ones that i remember: a gauntlet clutching a fistfull of 
fieldflowers (a last minute throw-together, but *very* handsom), a tankard, a 
magnificent plume of pampas grass emergent from a bear's head, a paper-mache 
tower (which lasted a very long time, because it broke in half but stayd 
connected by a strip--every time it was hit it would flop over, but every time 
the fighter bent over to have the crest measured to see if it were offically 
short enough, it would fall back together again), a barbie doll dressed up to 
represent "what's black & white & red all over & can't turn around in a narrow 
corridor", etc....
It's fun to watch, i've been told its fun to fight, and it's *impossible* to 
take seriously

Subject: Gold Leaf

Real gold leaf is indeed prohibitively expensive.  We have, however, 
found an alternative.  There exists what is called faux gold, made of
mylar, that looks almost exactly like real gold, comes in the same
booklets, and is applied and burnished in the same manner as real gold.
Its cost, however, makes it much more commonly used, because it sells 
for under $10 a book.  You have to be a real pro to tell the difference
between this and the real thing, and this is not much more expensive
than the awful heathen disgusting gold paint. :-)  This marvellous 
stuff handles more easily than real gold too; you can touch it with
your hands without it exploding into a powder, and it takes little
burnishing to get a beautiful glow.  It also comes in silver-tone
that will never tarnish.  I just finished a knigthood scroll with 
black and silver-leaf mantling, and it was great to hear the crowd go
"OOOOoooooh".  I got mine from an art&hobby store.  Look all over and
ask; it may be in strange places, because some people use the same
stuff to 'gold-leaf' statuary or figurines.  If you still can't find
any, write or email to me and I'll see what I can work out. 

I'm really excited to hear that someone in the SCA has succeeded in
making vellum.  I've long dreamed of trying, but living in suburbia 
makes that sort of thing difficult.  I think I'll write her and ask her
to put another article in TI about it.  (Actually, it's probably in her
newsletter.  I better subscribe to that.)  Happy leafing!

Subject: bows

"...and they don't use bows"
what combat archery uses instead of bows are things that *look* exactly like 
bows, but only draw 30 pounds or less.  
c.f. the errol flyn robin hood where e.f. (r.h.) says to the village champion 
"shall we remove this target to a fit distance for men to shoot at" and the 
little men in livery trundle the target back another 20 feet
c.f. the many, many heros starting with Odessyus who had bow that only they 
could draw.
although it is certainly *possible* to hit things with a light bow, even 
things at a fair distance, if one raises one's firing angle enough, (the force 
of the arrow as it lands is another question entirely), although it may add a 
certain spice to things to have to keep running to keep from getting "killed", 
and although i'm sure some people derive great pleasure from hitting heavy 
listers with projectile boffers and watching them fall over, i'm not sure the 
result is archery.
The joy and beauty of archery lies in the space from the draw until just after 
the release when arrow, archer, bow, target, and the air betwean are one thing 
and nothing.  I'ts easier to achieve with a heavier bow.
(the thwok as the arrow hits target is another source of satisfaction.)

This describes  something I participated in (without archery) at a Pennsic
a number of years ago (XI? X? IX? Who knows?).  The boars were all two-weapon,
all case of swords ("Florentine"), and the hunters were mostly spears/poles.
Problem: if the boards hid from the hunters (this was in the Pennsic woods)
nothing happened; the spearmen laager'd up and waited for the boars to attack
in an uncoordinated fashion, which they did.  It was a good way of exploring
the woods.  If, on the other hand, the number of two-weapon fighters is large
enough and they use coordinated tactics then it turns into a different
fight completely.

In the one I participated in there was a problem in that if one boar attacked
a unit of spearmen/women then the rule of no more than four engaging at once
was rapidly lost and the boars were attacked from too many places at once.  In

        The most common reason for the decimation of a century was cowardice in
battle.  This gave men in the century a choice; keep fighting and hope your
skill was great enough to keep you alive, or retreat and face a one in ten
chance of getting killed anyway.

        One other "feature" of this system was that there was an easy way to
spur the century on into more vigourous fighting.  If they were not fighting
hard enough their standard was THROWN into the enemy ranks.  Any commander
would 'reason' that if the enemy has captured your standard you must have
retreated in a cowardly fashion, therefore the century would have to recapture
the standard or face decimation.

Subject: A history of cattle raiding
Message-Id: <1002@hjuxa.UUCP>

Modern cattle raiding began at Pennsic XVI, although I could be mistaken.
Some members of Clan O'Choda who had arrived early decided to arorn thier
camp with a bull and a cow. These were proudly displayed until our beloved
Baron and a few of his guard attended a party at the camp. Somehow the
cattle walked over to the Baronial encampment, where they were immediately
branded. In the interests of esthetics, the brand covered an objectionable
scar like mark which might be described as a bunch of grapes.

Carillion is a very trusting Barony and later that night our trust was
abused as someone stole the cattle out of our camp. This led to our baron
posting a report in the Daily Tidings together with an offer of a reward for
their return. Many days passed and much mockery was made of our baron before
it was revealed that some members from the Clan O'Choda had stolen the
cattle and hidden them.

In reparation, on the last day of the war, Lord Anton MacRae brought the
cattle back to our camp and made a gift of them to our baron. They had
managed to lift our brand revealing the ugly grape marks again.

Being a good baron, Pug, brought the cattle back to our homelands and
delivered them into the care of the populace where they prospered and
encouraged a herd to form.

In the closing days of AS XXII, there was an altercation between our Barony
and our neighbours to the south, the Shire of Barren Sands. We took our
flocks and herds with us so that our fighters could better defend them but
again we suffered at the hands of cattle raiders and it was only by
subterfuge, aided by Baron Erik Rodbjorn of Settmour Swamp, that we were
able to recover the missing cattle.

Thus it was that in AS XXIII we were able to bring a large herd of cattle, a
few sheep and a goat to the Pennsic War.

Our herald was sent with messages to His Magesty King Gavin, to tell him
that due to an outbreak of 'Foot in Mouth' we had NO livestock, and to Baron
Erik, Baron Ian, the head of Clan O'Choda and the head of group called
Drunken Badger (since they had ceded us land for our encampment) to say that
these were our livestock and that they were to keep their hands off.

Somehow these messages were misinterpreted as, within minutes, Lady Merlynia
of Settmour Swamp had made off with one of the cows.

Much of the livestock migrated to the camp of the Drunken Badger. Our first
success of the war was when my son, commonly known as Goblin and aged 6,
recovered a cow from the Drunken Badger after dark.

Well,  on the subject of cattle raiding.  There have been many
historical precidents for it.  The longest ago to come to mind
was the famous ( infamous ) cattle raid some 13 years ago wherin
it is said Jamie Selkirk was hanged.  The only problem was
no one ever found the body after it was put to the gibbit.

I'll have to check back diaries to get the exact date, I've rather
forgotten.

I was at the barroom brawl, it was at Rivenstar, the Baron's birthday bash
(and all around good time.)

the Barroom brawl was a bunch of fridge boxes cut for use as tables and 
bars.  there were 3 sides, the tavern employees, the local militia, and the
patrons.  all the fighters were divided into 3 groups, distinguished by
different colors of tape, and took turns being each of the 3 groups.

the scenario is this:  the bar doesnt want to be trashed.  therefore, they
do not let anyone in with weapons, and they check you at the door for them.
the bar employees have hidden a few weapons behind the bar.  thus, in order
to get a weapon in the door, you must disguise it. (some of the better ones
were a baby (mace in a blue blankie), a potted plant (sword with some sprigs
tied to the hilt standing in a pot), a coatrack, a frying pan, a pizza, and
a bottle of booze.  everyone (except the militia) piled in the bar (list field)
and commence to talking until someone started a fight.  now if you were
thrown outside the boundaries, it was considered that you hit a wall or went
thru a window, and thus were either dead or knocked out.  once it was
apparent to outside the bar (enough people thrown out or noise) the militia
came in and cleaned up.  the cardboard stuff lasted about 3-4 rounds before
it gave up.

At the risk of revealing myself something of a language nerd, this means that
the Outlands force lost *one-tenth* of its number.  "Decimation" was the
Roman practice of killing one man per decade to inspire the remaining nine
to greater efforts.  For those of you who are now completely confused, the
smallest Roman battle unit was the "decade", which consisted of ten men.  Ten
of these were combined into a unit of one hundred men called -- you guessed it
-- a "century".  The leader of this unit was the "centurian".  If discipline
was lax, or for whatever reason (any military scholars out there?) the
centurion would be ordered to decimate his century.  The decades drew lots,
or somehow decided, and each killed one of its number.  Pretty gruesome, but
reasonably effective.

I know that Mr. Rubin's usage is quite correct by modern standards.  It just
seemed appropriate to mention the point in this particular forum.  :-)

Subject:  Scouting...

Someone mentioned scouts outrunning fighters...

A scout that thinks he can outrun a fighter is probably one that is going
to die soon...

My own Pennsic story:

After entering the woods (at a casual stroll since it would be 30 minutes
before any real action started) we (Clovenshield plus a couple of
"shock troops") were near the high meadow when the second gun went off
informing us that scouts were now in the woods.  Three of us decided
that we would go kill some scouts to amuse ourselves.  We snuck over the 
ridge in the hill and waited - unfortunately the place was peppered with 
fighters and scouts were dying like flies.  However Yamurra was the first
to get his kill - rather unceremoniously chasing a scout down in a speed
run.  I picked one up and chased him down through a mud hole(yum) - someone
later told me he was the scout commander for the Shadowdancers.  And Aikido
got his kill in a long twisting run.

Satisfied we returned uphill where we stopped to chat with (the ghost of) Wolf
the Mighty - whose spirit returned this year to fight with the Chux.  I must
say that (even being dead) he hasn't lost a whit of his ability!!!

Later I killed approx 11 more scouts.

The moral is - speed DOES NOT make a scout invulnerable.  BRAINS make a scout
 less vulnerable.  When a fighter puts on a helm his IQ suffers, if you're
 a scout DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN! Don't die from curiosity or information-greed,
 and when you're running from a fighter DON'T look over your shoulder. ;-)

An ancient and venerable tradition in the West (isn't everything in the
West ancient and venerable?) is the Pandybat Competition, held once a
year at Purgatorio Coronation or at October Crown.  The trophy is named 
Phil, and he is a stuffed panda bear with bat wings.  The winner must 
embroider their name(s) on the wings, or add some token to Phil's
accoutrements.  Phil already has a headband, a ponytail flail,
morris bells, numerous baldrics, and a pin or two.  The contest is
a melee, using new weapons that are "sure to devastate the field".
This means that the invented weapon is more dangerous to the bearer
than to any of the bearer's foes.  This gets VERY silly.  The object,
of course, is NOT to win the melee itself, but to demonstrate in action
the incredible futility of the 'weapon' you have invented.  Past
winners have been the 'turn pike', two spears lashed together to form a
cross, with thrusting tips at all four ends, borne by four people;
the aforementioned Ponytail Flail, a mace head on a two foot length of
rope attached to the head (he died saluting the Crown); the War Caber,
a ten-foot long duct-taped cardboard tube with a lanyard; and this
year's winner, the Battle Anvil. (Foam covered in duct tape, but he
played it very well)  We do this for the amusement of the Queen and the
populace, and to keep ourselves from taking this all too seriously.  

I hope this gives you some ideas, William, good luck!

You either didn't attend or didn't listen at any of the East Kingdom's

That's where we take our heaviest scout causualties.

You're the first person to admit that they saw this (at least as far as I
know).  The scout's injury was not serious, the neck brace was an error
on the side of caution on the chirurgeons part.  We would still like to
know who did it as the scouts description was no better than yours.

Try again.  The stuff we (Rhydderich Hael Calligraphers Guild) use is
22-karat gold.  Gold is expensive, period.

In the East, the term "Silly Weapons" means "anything that isn't sword
& shield", and dates from the days when virtually no one fought
anything else.  So, in my experience, a Silly Weapons Tourney has been
a great sword/polearm/two-sword tourney.  Is the term otherwise used
in other parts of the world?

(sorry to post this but my mailer won't work today).

I attended a 'silly' melee at Feast of Fools in Reven Star last April.
Now it has been awhile but I think I remember most of the rules.

It was a Bar Room melee.  Two sides: the Owner and his men; and Travelers.
Traveler could not bring weapons into the inn, but thery could bring in
other things :-) or use devices in the Bar.  All participants had to be 
in full armor, and anything used to fight with had to pass SCA weapons
rules.  Some of the more interesting fighting things were a frying pan,
a baby, (not sure of this didn't see it), and a potted tree.

It was an interesting melee.

I forgot the funniest part of the whole Ansteorra/Outlands War.
At closing court Sunday evening HMS Christopher was throwing candy
to the populace. HMS Rebeka (of Ansteorra) had gotten off her thrown
to help a child pick some up. One thing led to another and just as 
Christopher was throwing a handful (somewhat underhanded) Rebeka bent
over to pick up some and Christopher hit her a good one right on the
tush. After everyone picked themselves up from the ground amid much
tears (including thankfully HMS Michael) Ansteorra began a good natured
chant for war over the 'insult' to our Queen. On the way back to camp
we decided next year would be the Candy-assed war...

Greetings!

Sean Casey asks: This makes me wonder what is done if a woman wins the
Crown Tourney. Does she become Queen and pick her King? What if she is
fighting under a male persona? 


Exactly, my lord.  When a lord wins the Crown, he will become King and
the lady for whom he fought will become Queen.  When a woman wins a
Crown, she will become Queen, and the lord for whom she fought will
become King.  They would be styled "Queen and King of..." rather than
"King and Queen of..."  In such circumstances, the existance of
cross-sex personae is not recognized.  Each combattant in Crown must
fight for a consort of the opposite sex.

Duke Christopher of Houghton has indeed reigned as King of the West, 
beating his own father in the finals for that honor.  This was before
my time.  What a period flavor that must have had!  I met Duke
Christopher at Pennsic, so I have now had the honor of having fought
both him and his father, Duke William.  They are both tricky fighters, 
but lots of fun to fight, even though I lose rather quickly.

Duke Paul of Bellatrix has two sons, Steven and Brian.  Neither is a
Duke, or even a knight (in the West there are no unbelted kings),
though Steven will be the first to tell you that he will very shortly be
good enough to take on any three Dukes at once.  Both Steven and Brian 
are excellent archers.  Brian does not fight heavy weapons, and is quite
a gentleman and a good dancer.

This has happened twice on a principality level, but a woman has not
yet won a Crown List (just wait, though! :-).  (I heard that Countess
Elspeth McNaughton from Trimaris made it to the semi-finals. ) I think
it is the responsibility of the fighter to figure out what they would
do if they won the list.  I expect that the first will set the main
precedent.  I fight to crown my lord King of the West.  Some would want
to call him Queen's Consort, or some rot, but I feel that King and
Queen are the proper titles, and whichever one of them is the reigning
monarch shouldn't change that.  (OK, that's not period, but I think it 
retains the spirit of fighting for the honor of another, and *I* 
wouldn't sit for being called consort or concubine, or the king's 
squeeze, which rather equate, in my book.  Personal prejudice here.)

Do many female fighters enter the lists under a male persona?  I don't
ever recall that happening in my kingdom, and I would be greatly
interested in what she would do should she win.

This may be too late, as someone else may have answered the questions, but:

Last year (AS XXII) the Coopers instituted a rule that no one under the age of
18 may attend Pennsic without their parents or legal court appointed guardians.
The SCA minor waivers and medical waivers are NO GOOD.  (From what I have been
told, the medical waivers are not acceptable to Pennsylvania hospitals, although
I would bet that the hospitals DO issue a medical waiver form that they will
accept.  I know New York hospitals have one.)

Anyone under the age of 18 trying to enter Pennsic without their parents or
guardians attending will be sent home.

The reason for the ruling has to do with a minor attending the war without her
parents' permission (in fact, as I was told, her parents forbid her to attend).
When her parents found out she was there, legal proceedings were brought against
the Coopers.  For their own protection, the Coopers made the rule.

Is there anyone on the net who has attended such a tourney and wants
to tell about it? Was it fought like other tourneys or were there
Silly Rules, as well? Can you give any exemples of the kinds of weapons
one might use? What about safety regulations?

Though I've been inactive for about a year, I know that Paul's son

I don't know about the male persona aspect, but here in The Mists we
had a princess win by force of arms. Duchess Sir Maythen of Elfhaven
did win the Coronet lists, and Duke Sir William of Houghton was named
as Prince Consort. It was at the boar hunt held for her then Highness
that I recieved my AA. I was the boar, and the Princess my only victim,
but she evidently appreciated my efforts (2 hours running through swamp,
blackberry thickets, and hills in coat-of-plates, urk).

Having just returned from the Ansteorra/Outlands war I must say that
Christopher handled himself and the war extremely well. He and his
subjects gained much respect in Ansteorra for their chivalry and good
manners.  Of course I knew this having known Duke Sir Christopher when
he was King of Atenveldt....

Steven is presently here in Bjornsborg (San Antonio, Tx.) and not only
would he be the first to tell you he can take on three dukes at once
but he will tell you many times!!  :-)  I also don't believe he is a
squire as his father is his main teacher. Squiring to one's father in
the context of the SCA could be very complicated although I don't know
the actual reasons they haven't done so.

Look for war stories from Ansteorra/Outlands I (last year didn't
really count) in another article.

Message-Id: <22858@amdcad.AMD.COM>

As promised, here is some info on Ansteorra/Outlands I.

Good Points:
-Beautiful Site
-Georgeous weather
-no fire ants (very few natural pests)
-Very friendly and chivalrous for a war. I received
  many crys of "Good shot m'Lord!" and gave some of my own.
  Our entire Barony was pleased with the way Outlanders  
  played.
Bad Points:
-Only 4 out of 7 planned scenarios were actually fought.
-Killing from behind is still an incredibly weak gray area.
-The two Kingdom's camped separately.   

There was an overiding concern to make sure this war remained
friendly. I agreed with this policy!!! This was attempted by
having Saturday be mostly mixed melees, while the war was mostly 
Sunday. Thus while 5 scenarios were scheduled for Sunday, things got
started late, everyone was tired, and only two scenarios got done.
I didn't want to drive 10 hours to get killed by someone who kills
me every month *:-), I wanted to fight in a war! To keep things
friendly it would have been better (imho) to try to mix campsites,
and let all the fighting be war fighting. 

Enough criticism. The first war scenario was an open field battle
Saturday afternoon. Ansteorra slightly outnumbered Outlands (I heard 
101 to 89 ?). Outlands tried to flank on both sides. Our right flank
rolled up there left very successfully (yes my barony, Bjornsborg,
held this flank :-) ). The rest of the battle was very decisive with
Ansteorra losing half to 2/3 of their force whle Outlands was
decimated.

Bridge Battle: Ansteorra started with a charge which was no more than
a surge :-(  (Oh, to have been in the first rank ..) Outlands
showed their superior pole-arm skill with Counts Johann and Heinrich
at one point holding the entire frontline by themselves. Outlands won
with 10-20 people left.

Barricade: Very similar to the bridge with hay bales closing off
half the bridge. Results? Almost exactly the same as the Bridge fight.

Woods Battle: Limited Ressurection. Ansteorra defended the banner in the
woods. The area we  picked was a highly defensible but a very limited 
front cul-de-sac. In other words this turned into another BRIDGE BATTLE.
Need I give the results? Three limited front battles to the Outlands,
one open field to Ansteorra. This really highlighted the fact that
Ansteorra has very little recent war experience, as I feel bridge 
battles are sucessful directly proportional to how much you do them.

Other thoughts:
-Duke Christopher was very good about sending a similar number of
fighters to go against what ever force we had left when the fronts
disintegrated.
-Ansteorra had much less and poorer trained pikemen. Who uses spear
in lists? (which is mostly the kind of fighting we do here) I am
refering to long spears, by the way.

Highlights:
-HMS Michael riding onto the field on horseback with lance, beginning
of the second day.
-Duchess Rowen Beatrice von Kampher being field knighted in front of 
the massed forces of both armies. Nice surprise for all.
-Sq. Burke being field knighted after being the last standing Ansteorran
in the woods battle. Burke (and at first another gentlemen named Sean)
defeated about 6-8 fighters in single combat before HMS Christopher
asked him to yield in honor.

Sorry this went on so long, this was one of the most fun events I've
been to in 6 years of SCA. I hope this war becomes a tradition.

			 Ld. Robyn Solarius
			 Bjornsborg, Ansteorra

P.S. I would sure like to hear from some Outlanders to see if my
recollections are much different than yours.

Subject: An Tir Crown Results

It is my pleasure to announce the results of the An Tir Crown tourney held
on Sunday Sept 4 in Adiantum:

Inspired on to victory by his lady that day was Duke Sir Eirik Thorinsson
who won the best two out of three battles in the final round over
Sir Torkil Kana (sp). Prince Eirik and Princess Meagan ferch Meredith will
be crowned at Twelfth Night.

As Duke Eirik was Champion of An Tir at the time of his investiture as
Prince and because the two positions cannot be held by the same person at
the same time, a new Champion had to be chosen. Duke Eirik chose to pass
the position of Champion to the fighter he had defeated in the Champion's
Tourney at last July Coronation: Sir Torkil Kana.

Greetings Gentles and Nobles,

	To those of you I had the good fortune to meet at the War,
Bart the Bewildered, Fiacha, Megan, Arval, Johannes der Hasse, Malice,
Lieghyndra, Majir and some others around the campfire whose names my poor
mind has lost, I hope you all had a pleasent journey home.  To those
of you whom I missed, most notably William de Corbie, Danulf and Master
Kobiyashi, I say Next Year!

	The Dragon's Mark western camp sailed into the site Sunday 
evening.  We shared a comfortable hillside off of the Great Middle
Highway with a group from Cynnabar, and found the location wonderful
compared to last years (when we were out in the tent desert near the
port.) (Sorry, I've always prefured the analogy of cars to ships 
better than cars to dragons.)  It turned out we didn't need the shade
as much as we thought we might, due to the cool tempatures this year,
But it made for a pleasent morning if one had the luxury of sleeping
late.  

	The week was spent on the ussual Pennsic activities: letting
the merchants pry money away from us, saying hello to old friends,
making new ones and this year looking up those friends from the net 
who had made it.  We also worked at various times, for those of you 
who are attending your first few events, volunteer to sit troll, 
stand guard, or cry the camp.  You get to meet people, and people
get to meet you.  

	I also had a chance on tuesday and thursday to re-aquaint myself
with the bow, I had not shot one in ne'er 20 years, and the practice 
did me much good.  I was also able to attend a class on archery, in 
particular on aiming, something I had no idea how to do.  Both the
class and the practice was relaxed, with lots of helpful people about.

	Three of us attended a class on autocrating, taught by a Lady from
An Tir whose name I missed (by arriving late, Rebecca or David may know it.)
Again, useful and informative stuff, presented to what turned out to be a 
small group (8 or so.  Are all A&S classes that small?)  Carillion camp was
very friendly when we visited (thanks Fiacha and company) later that evening.

	The morning of the Champions battles was cool and wet, but the rain
stopped before the camp was fully awake and the temp. was pleasent.  I missed
the unbelted Champions battle due to armor inspection, but news quickly
arrived that the Middle had won it.  I arrived in time to see the Belted
Champions of the Middle lose to those of the East.  After seeing one Lucan
made Master at arms (with Master Kobiyashi's sword, or so I heard) I watched
the Queen's Champions of the two sides meet and the Middle again was the
victor.  ( A side note here.  I thought the idea of having the Queen's
Champions of the Middle where war tabards of our allies a nice gesture,
though it did confuse a few of the people around me.  And while I am
on the topic of tabards, HRM, Duke Sir John the Bearkillers war tabard
was great.  Red and white, it had a *wonderfully* done teddy-bear on the
front... and the teddybear's back on the back!  My respects to the lady 
who did the work.)  

	That afternoon Sean and I attended a class on "Zen and the Art
of Sword and Sheild" taught by Sir Hilary of the West Kingdom (the only
kingdom not represented by royalty this year.)  A most informative class,
but one useful to a wide range of experiance, I've been fighting about
seven years, and Sean has never fought.  I am trying to pass on what I 
learned to some of our local people who are starting to fight.  It was
here that I chanced to meet Malice, much to our mutual surprise.  Good 
luck fighting, my lady.

	I must also say that, judging from the class and Sir Hilary's
technique, that some of what I have heard and seen of the heavyness of
blows in the West is due much to a more refined study of fighting
as to any calousness about blow level.  I am still worried when I hear
of "perfect" blows that feel effortless and yet knock people off of
thier feet.  While I can not but respect the skill displayed, I still
can wonder if it is for the best.  The level of study, however, was
superior to any I have recieved or seen in the Middle or in Ansteorra.

	The day of the field battle started overcast and cool, with 
some wind.  After forming up with my unit (known for this war as
Eislynn's Guard, after the Lady who inspired the unit's formation
last year), I once again ended up acting as a shieldman for a banner.
This year the war banner was Duke Talymar's personal banner, Eislynn's
banner and the banner of the Guard were carried by non-combatants who
retired from the field before we engaged.  
*Lesson Number 1: Don't volunteer to be banner Guard when the banner 
carrier has orders to stick beside the commander, and the commander
is a fun loving Duke whose idea of fun is to attack 40 man units all
by himself!

	After the false start (something to do with miscommunication
between the marshall's and the cannon crew), our unit was in reserve on
the (Middle's) right flank on a rise.  A flanking force for the East,
consisting of (so I heard) the Trimarian army, house Von Halstern and
a third unit circled around our way.  With a Septemptrian unit on our
right, House Darkwinds to our left, and the Fighters of the Great Dark
Horde mixed in somewhere, we advanced to engage them as a wall...
	
	Except for Talymar, his Banner carrier, and myself.  Before 
House Darkwinds was even with the Guard, Talymar moved out to flank the 
attackers, with the Banner and myself right behind.  Moving around behind 
the enemy line, Talymar moved up to attack...

	And a voice from the other side of the banner carrier says "My lord?"
WHACK.  An eastern knight had seen us and wanted that banner.  The gentleman
carrying it was equal to the chalange, and warded the first blow as we wheeled
to attack and...   HOLD!!

	There followed two or three minutes of pleasent bantering with the 
knight while the marshall's got the dead out.  The Eastern Knight noticed 
Talymar for the first time, the forces we had circled noticed us for the
first time  ( and started drooling...) and the three of us decided that 
the sneak attack from behind wasn't going to work.  As soon as "Lay on!"
was called we moved at a dignified sprint back to our lines...

	After that things disintegrated as far as I could tell.  We 
reformed with a small group of fighters (some of whom I recognized as
Sternfelders), then I somehow ended up facing 4 spearmen and only saw
3... and after that I didn't see much from under my shield.

	About 6 (of 30 or so) of the Guard survived the battle.  One 
of the survivors, a Lord Sato, had captured the Trimarian war banner.
We retired from the field to Talymar's camp, then marched down to the 
Trimarian camp to return the banner.  Talymar and Lord Sato presented
it to HRM of Trimaris freely, but asked afterwards for three boons, 
a beer for Sato (Michelob Dark, a cold one), that one of Eislynn's 
favors be carried on the banner here-after, and that we could have 
one of His Queen's favors to carry on our banner ( the Queen of 
Trimaris had had to return home after a back injury early in the
week.)  After that we marched home.

	I saw a good deal less (and more) of the woods battle that afternoon.
As I carry a BIG shield and long sword into field battles, I thought that
using a two weapons and having thrusting tips would be better in the woods.
*War Lesson #2:  Never volunteer to protect scouts if you are out of shape
and your armor wieghs 70#.  I did learn a lot about the woods, but was 
exhausted by the time I met the enemy.  I understand the scout *did*
get away though...

	There ws one unfortunate incident in the woods.  I was present when
a Rizzaki scout was hit in the back of the head by a Tuchux, though I didn't 
see the blow.  The scout I saw walking away, and her body english was more
of indignation than pain, but I later saw her with a neck brace on.  I hope
someone from the Septemptian forces nearby can describe the Tuchux involved,
I couldn't tell at that point which one it was (they all ran off.)

	After the woods battle the count stood at 3 to 2, with the Middle
in a slim lead.  The next mornings bridge battle consisted of three
bridges, two flanking bridges 9 feet wide and 30 long, and a center
bridge 18 feet wide and 30 feet long.  Eislynn's guard was once again
in reserve, and we stood around watching for all but about 15 minutes
of the fight.  At that point the East had commited thier reserves and was
only barely holding the center bridge.  As a column of 2s we hit the right 
side of the line, and after a brief hold to clear the bodies, we broke through.
While we formed up a line and advanced on the right hand bridge, the remainder
of the Midrealm's forces on the center bridge swept the defenders away and 
attacked the left hand one.  Meanwhile we attacked the rear guard on the
righthand bridge, and swept it clean (after, of course, I ate another 
spear :-), capturing the War Banners of the East, Trimaris (again!) and
Drachenwald.   We returned the Banners of the East and Drachenwald (captured
by Sir Fern and a gentle whose name escapes me now) on the field.  Lord
Sato, having captured the Trimarian banner for the second time, was presented
with the Dragon's Tooth (award for valor on the field.)  We returned the 
Trimarian banner at closing court that evening.

	All that remained was a quick war point shoot ( I was happy with
my score) and shower.  Then closing court.  Duke Talymar asked that the
name Eislynn's Guard be retired, along with the banner's of the guard an
Eislynn's personal banner.  This was made so, and so the group is once
again known as the Queen's Guard.  We retired from court as a unit, and 
saw Talymar off, after recieving his thanks and gifts of beer and cookies.
And after that all I did was pack up and sail home. Well, I did stick 
around long enough to find out who won.

	Various people have asked why the Midrealm had so many more allies
than the East.  Some have said that it was due to the personalities 
involved.  In my few dealings with the King of the East at the war, I 
found him to be friendly and likable.  And I know I've heard as many
people saying nay about their RM of the Middle as of the East.  
	Part of it, I'm sure, is inertia.  Several years ago the Middle
Bribed the Atlantians into fighting with us, and for all I know they
now think it traditional.  Calontyr is a former Midrealm pricipality,
and the current King and Queen are former Midrealmers with strong
tyes here.  Meridies declared for us as far back as Christmas last year,
and the fame of Duke Sir John may have helped too.
	And last, we had the services of Duke Sir Talymar.  For those of
you that havn't seen the man, there isn't much I can say.  We all *try*
to act like we are in the Middle Ages "as they should have been."  
Talymar is one of those rare individuals who not only does so, and
does it well, but he makes you do it better too.  I would go so far
as to say that it is impossible to meet him and not like him.  Certainly
he is one of only three individuals that I have met in the society that
I love.  One of the others was his Lady-wife, Duchess Eislynn the Patient,
who died last spring.  While I object to the charges that the Middle
used it's "dead Queen" (very strongly I object!), I cannot doubt that 
memory of her brought us fighters.  I do not think that thier service 
was less for it being in her memory.

	I know I've left a few things out, the campfire at Setmore Swamp,
the rainy party at Carillion, and the wonderfull SCA-TV that Trimaris (and 
Majir the Blatant, I know you are out there!) put on, but this is too 
long as it is.  Perhaps another time.  Till then.

	In general I would recommend a spun top or other sloping top
design over the flat top, but certainly they both will work.  If you 
(or anyone else on the net, for that matter) has a group of people 
(at least 5) who would like helms, I can send you the address of an
old friend in Ansteorra who makes helms.  For $50 plus ~$6 shipping per
helm he can send you a spun top helm that is legal in all kingdoms and
*nice*.  Plenty of room inside, good vision and breathing (and watering!),
welded throughout with some rivits that are welded over.  Pad them up,
add a chinstrap to taste and you are off and running.  I just got a 
shipment of 8 for local fighters, and everyone is happy with them.

	Not an opinion per se, but I did appriciate Eisenstrand's offer to
do minor repairs at the war.  I popped a rivit on a gauntlet took it
to them, and was ready to go again between battles.  Nice people.  But
as I wasn't looking for armor at this war, I can't help pick between them
and others.

	"They don't let you use bows."????  I'm confused, *what were* they
using?  I too missed it at the war, but at the Meridies-Middle war (Border
Raids, we just had #13 in June) we use combat archery, mostly 30# bows
and wooden arrows with standard thrusting tips, or golf tube arrows.  The
wooden shafted arrows are getting out 40 to 50 yards from the 30# bows,
golf tubes only fly that far if you can use the 50# bows ( I use a 50#
longbow.  With golftube arrows I can get a flight of up to 55-60 yards.
I agree, they don't look like arrows, but they fly ok...)

	Yes, it would have been nice to have been able to see the targets 
at 150 and 160 yards from the line.  It would have been even nicer to have had
a few chances to *practice* shooting at them.  But at the thursday practice
it was either shoot at the 75 yard mark or targets.

	Did anyone get the exact numbers from the archery?  I recall
something like 300 per side shooting, and a score of 600-something for
the East and low 700s for the middle in the clout shoot, and 150 Middle
and 200 something East for the sled.  I would be interested in hearing
the exact numbers.  

	I also never heard any estimates on the fighters present.  In 
the pictures we took the sides look about even, but I can't begin
to guess how many people were there fighting...

As far as the powers that be are concerned, this is a false rumor. James
apparently has first-hand knowledge of this pestulance, but it seems that
the autocrat knows nothing about it. I relayed James's message to our
seneschal, who in turn told our kingdom seneschal, who called the
Pennsic autocrat for verification, and he hadn't heard of any pestulance.
Our kingdom seneschal then called me to ask the source of this "rumor."


James (and anyone else who has FIRST-HAND knowledge of this)-

In SCA Digest #99, Lord Mitchel MacBain writes (concerning His Majesty

"He is also part of the only father-son Duke Team in the SCA."

I have heard that Duke Paul de Bellatrix has a son who is also a Duke.
Please correct me if I'm wrong.

RE Illumination materials:

In Europe, you buy gold leaf from art supply shops. You can also get
it from goldsmiths. It comes in "booklets" of maybe 8 or 10 leaves
which lie between soft papers. There are two "grades", called "fully
hammered" or "half hammered". The former is very thin, the latter is
somewhat thicker and easier to work with.
We also get gold leaf with or without wax. One variety has been treated
with wax in order to stick better to the surface. If you are trying to
do things the medieval way, you should buy the other kind, without wax.

I have heard from some people in Caid that they can get a sort of fake
gold leaf (extremely thin brass?) which is a lot cheaper and very suita-
ble for practise (you don't want to waste expensive gold with your
beginner's mistakes). Try asking at a goldsmith's or at one of those
shops that carry artist's equipment. If this fails, ask a restorer. We
had a restorer here who did some work on the local church, and when he
found out I was interested in gold leaf he gave me a burnishing stone
and lots of advice. Another possible source is a bookbinder's workshop.
Luxury books sometimes have gilt edges with real gold leaf.

As to the cost, I expect to pay some 55 dollars for a "booklet" of
gold leaf.

Yours, William de Corbie

This makes me wonder what is done if a woman wins the Crown Tourney. Does she

Does anyone know when the cattle disappeared from Elf Hill?  We had a bunch
of them when I finished raiding, er rounding up strays, but they were all
gone by the time I woke up later that day.  Two of the cattle were the cow
and bull that had been at the party at Cloven Shield the night before, the
cow sporting the brand "I never met a bull I didn't like".  This is the
night that it rained very hard and the Elves pavilion went down (or was torn
down by irate cattle owners).

Also I understand that the cattle from Ahoda were actually from somewhere
else.  Any good ideas on the pedigree of that beef?

I personally think it should be a war point to retain the most cattle at the
end of the war, after all, the troops must be fed properly.  Besides it's so
much fun sneaking past a sleeping sentry while trying not to drop a heavy
cow or lose your grip on the darn bell around it's neck.  For real fun, try
two at once.  Wet plywood sure gets heavy.

I've recently gotten interested in Medieval scroll illumination. I've
done some research and I think I'm going to have a lot of fun with it.

Most of the things I want to do are done with easily found materials:
pen, ink, oil based paints, golden paint, etc.  There are some
materials I want to try out that I have no idea of where to find. For
example, I want to try gold leaf burnishing. This isn't nearly as hard
as it sounds, and looks awfully good. Unfortunately, I have no idea
where to find gold leaf.  The stuff I'm looking for is about 1/200000
inch thickness, is backed with thin paper, and is probably manufactured
for this purpose. I doubt it's terribly expensive because of it's
thinness.

I remember a merchant selling Limner's materials at Pennsic, and I'm
writing them a letter to see if they can help. If anyone here can point
me at materials, I'd be most grateful.

Subject: Pensic Scout Story...
Message-Id: <cX87OPy00Uo504kLJX@andrew.cmu.edu>


In response to the requests for Pensic stories, here's one that
happened to me:

On Wednesday of Pensic 17 was held the Inter-Kingdom Scouting
Competition. It was done in two rounds. In the first round the scouts were
sent out into the woods to find as many little pieces of paper tied to 
trees as they could, memorise the troop discription on it, and report
back to the starting point WITHOUT getting killed by the numerous
scout killers in the woods. In the second round the scouts were to
run messages that they had memorized from point to point, again
avoiding the scout killers.

I showed up egar to enter this competition. Like a good scout, I
teamed up with two other people, one of which, like me, had never
been in a woods battle, the other being a vetran. They took us on a
walk through the woods, showing us the landscape, explaining how not
to get caught in the swamps and how to use the thickets to our
advantage when running from a killer. With that little training, the
set us free.
We started by running up the causeway. BIG mistake. About five scouts
were masacared by a camouflaged fighter. We got away, running uphill
to the birch trail. Pausing on the trail for a breath, another
mistake, we were confronted by another killer. We split up, the
killer following me (sigh). Running for my life, I did not realise
that I was running into a tipical scout trap. Lo, there in front of
me, too close to avoid, was none other that the leader of the
Shadowdancers, an elite midrealm scout and scoutkiller group. He laid
me low (ok, I ran into him), and I glumly walked back to the starting
point and waited, as there was no resurection (the information dies
with the scout). I waited with some 15 dead East kingdom scouts, and
it did not look good for us. Finally, my other team members came in
and reported. They had found 4 of the 10 troop collumns in the time
period. 
And thus started round two. We started at field 3, and was told to
run a message to field one. We decided to use the birch trail, as the
upper trail was sure to be occupied. This time, though, I hung back
about 10 feet from my team members, so that when we met the killer,
he ran after them. Thus separated, I continued on the birch trail,
until a met another fighter off to my left, taunting me and calling
to other fighters. I began to run once again, but this time my
survival instinct took over, and when I sensed the third member of
the scout trap off to my right, I immideatly veered to my left, right
into a swamp. Yuck. Being easily dispached then, I walked back to
resurrection point to get another message. Picking it up, I met up
with my two team members, the novice being also killed once, and we
began to go downstream on the side of the causeway. We followed the
causeway down until we heard a fighter comming down the trail twards
us. Crossing the causeway and again splitting up, I began to stalk
along the other side of the causeway, this time with extream caution.
When I spotted the fighters, I avoided them easily, but again came
upon the same fighter in the same spot, again taunting me. I knew by
this time, however, that I can easily outrun fighters, but that I had
to be careful WHERE to run. I began to run, outdistancing the
fighter, untill I came to the trail, where the leader of the
ShadowDancers was waiting for me. I ran uphill, pushing myself as
fast as I could go, and got to the top of the hill and collapsed,
giving my message as I did. 
My pleasure at finally accomplishing a mission was soon to be
exceeded by things to come. The first was that I went through woods
battle without getting killed and really helping out with the
battles. Since East Kingdom won woods battle, I was satisifyed with
myself. Secondly, I was suprised to learn that my team had won the
competition, and that we were to appear in court! I belive that these
two facts definitly make up for how painful my legs were for most of
the week.
So there, good gentles, is my contribution to our war stories. Lets
hear some more!

other states.  Think about it -- 3 seas -- Atlantic & Gulf of Mexico &
the Carribean.  They'd have a hard time having Miss & Lou & Ark in
their kingdom, which is why Meridies has those states.

Don't forget they they used to be the Defenders of Grenada and are now

Other sheep herding areas?  Like everything south to Cape Horn? :-)

The Outlands sure seems like a *fun* kingdom ... maybe I'll take

HRM of the Middle did a lot of travelling - to Thorvald's coronation in the
far reaches of Calontir, to Atlantia, to Meridies, etc.  

HRM Thorvald of Calontir started life in the SCA about one year after I
joined the Shire of Mynyyd Seren in the Middle.  He and I used to travel
to fighting practice in the Barony of Rivenstar.  He eventually became
squired to Master Corwyn Dragonstar and was knighted just before his
departure to Calontir.  The alliance between Calontir and the Middle at
Pennsic XVII was not guaranteed, however.

This is a true story.  When 17 (we don't allow authorization until 18
in the Middle) Thorvald journeyed out of Kingdom to a distant land that
shall remain nameless.  While there he attended a fightng practice at
which he lost one bout (he knew nothing of face thrusts) but lost not
another.  One of the gentles conveyed him to the airport, and remarked
on his skill at arms, to which Thorvald responded "Yes, but they don't
think I'm good enough to authorize in the Middle yet".

The guard duty had nothing to do with dissatisfaction in an Eastern
barony; Duke Sir Vissevald and HRM Gavin had seen an advertisement
for Midrealm gate guards and decided that they qualified (only size
was mentioned, not Kingdom of fealty).  It was a wonderful way to
reduce the tensions that naturally arise at the War.

Hearing the gentles discussing the joys of trich brought me to mind of a story
that I heard from a friend of mine who is a nurse in the boston area.  It 
seems that an intern was examining a youngish college girl who was complaining
of genital discomfort.  As he examined her relevant parts, he commented:

	"It looks as though you have acute trich.  Have you had any
		sexual contacts lately?"

He explained a bit about trichomoniasis, gave her a perscription, and sent 
her off.

The next day, she showed up with mother and lawyer in tow, charging the young
man who examined her (luckily with a female nurse in the room to stand witness)
as having sexually harrassed her.  The young woman heard, loosely translated,
"Gosh you have a cute trick.  Had any good sex lately?"

Another cheer for the litigous society.  The charges were dropped immediately,
though.

Subject: Reply to: Getting to Pennsic from the West Coast


I was intrigued by Lady Coranna's tale of journying to Pensic from the
West.  I only have 12 hours of travel (Mearly one full day, or one
gruelling night) from Carolingia to the Debatable Lands.  [I really
pity the travellers from L'Isle du Dragon Dormont.  They are 8 hours
north and east of me, and Still Part of the EAST!!! In a way the
*must* come, not like our visitors from around the knowne world, who
although they add to the spirit of the event, are not bound by ties of
fealty to the embattled monarchs, but I digress].

Even my 12 hours upon my camel are tiring enough that I have
considered stopping for a night along the way, and I had thought on an
ingenious plan for doing so.  About half-way between myself and the
camp of the embattled armies, lies a public Parkland called Rickett's
Glen State Park.  Camping fees are quite reasonable (like 5 dinars per
car, or maybe its 5 dinar a head) although they may have risen since I
last camped in the public lands.  Furthermore, I already have my
camping gear with me.  Especially, if I made no attempt to cook at
camp, or just to boil water for coffee and oatmeal, this strategem
could have me arriving in a pleasant and rested state.  A similar plan
might be well advised for those travelling from distant lands,
although some planning must be taken, as many parks require
reservations.

As for my friends in college, it is not so much the cost of the week
that discourages them, as the cost of taking the vacation days.  Most
summer jobs do not allow vacation with pay, and hence the money they
would loose is a larger deterent than the money they would spend.
Come to think of it, that is the flaw in my plan.  It would require
more vacation days for the drivers as well, turning for Lady Coranna a
two week trip into a three week journey.

I hope my musings have been of some assistance.  

May Peace be upon you.

No, you were right.  We got the official results today.  Basically, western New
York came in highly in favor of becoming a principality and will be officially
polled.  West Virginia sent in two responses, and is presumed not to be
interested.  Same with central Pennsylvania.  BMDL voted fairly strongly in
favor of a principality, but voted *against* the specific suggestions, and will
not be polled.

Personally, I see the problem with the BMDL results as stemming from weaknesses
in the straw poll rather than local confusion:  The options which were
presented were all pretty bad from a local standpoint.  Either they meant
forming a principality of unmanageable dimensions or they involved isolating
the BMDL.  (I thought the suggestion of drawing a north-south border and
forming a principality on a Hael-BMDL axis was the least-bad solution, but it
wasn't one of the options, except as a write-in.)

A number of people have expressed unhappiness with Pennsic having an even
number of war points.  Now, I have no objection to a war resulting in a draw (a
not uncommon outcome), but I suppose we can think of a ninth point.

This year's war saw an unprecedented level of cattle raiding.  Unfortunately,
the logistics of making that an official point would be problematic.  (Besides,
we're not all Celts :-)  However, some of the associated raids this year were
by sea, and that suggests something more promising:  An *aquatic* war point!  A
sea battle.  Naturally, I am not advocating any reduction in armor standards
for this battle :-)

	As the Baron of the Barony in question, allow me to clarify this.
On Sunday Morning (before the War), in the morning cry of the camp, the
Midrealm requested people to guard their camp, and stated they were "an
equal opportunity employer."  In the Stonemarche camp, we thought it would
be a neat trick to have people of the East guarding the Midrealm Royal
encampment.  We donned our livery, and marched up to volunteer our services.
	"Milord," said I to the man at the gate, "I would like to offer the
services of my Barony to gaurd the Midrealm Royal camp."
	"Your offer is most gladly accepted," came the reply, "do come in." 
	So into the camp trudge a dozen Eastern fighters (we did this on
short notice, with those that happened to be around at the time), right past
the current gaurds.  It soon becomes established that we will be guarding
the camp every day before the weekend, from noon 'til one.
	"By the way, who are you?" belatedly asked our host.
	"The Barony of Stonemarche" I responded.  Since Stonemarch is a new
Barony (it will be one year old on 1 October) he'd apparently never heard
of it, and (I presume) assumed we were a distant group from one of the
Kingdoms allied with the Middle.
	"Once again, my thanks," he said.
	The Midrealm soon learned that we were from the East, though they had
no idea what to do about it, so they didn't try to stop us from guarding the
camp.
	On Wednesday, my warlord, Earl Sir Aelfwine Dunedane, sent two of his
more renown squires (now knights) to gaurd the Midrealm Royal camp.  These two
being Duke Sir Vissivald Selkirkson and His Majesty of the East, Gavin.  As has
been pointed out, this prompted Duke Sir Talymar to take up guard duty on the
Eastern Royal camp, begining the "Ducal Exchange Programme".

	In short, while I will not comment on whether or not the King of
the East is hard to get along with, I do want it clear that Stonemarche's
guard duty at the Midrealm Royal encampment should in no way be used as
an indication that he is hard to get along with.

Morgan, Baron Stonemarche

There appears to be a definite trend in the SCA of bringing more children
to events.  This is to be expected as people in the SCA are growing up
and getting married and having childern. Although, I have not children 
of my own, several people in my group do.  I don't mind other people 
bringing their children a long as they are reasonable well behaved.
No one I know minds people bringing their children to events.

As for what the children can do at events:

	In the West, we have two offices which handle this problem.
	1) The Kingdom Childrens Officer
	2) The Kingdom Page School
	
	Note: Neither of these offices is a babysitting service.

	The Kingdom Childrens Officer has the responsibility of
	organizing games and things for children to do at Kingdom
	events.  This includes treasure hunts, quests or just basic
	tag or hide-n-seek games. 

	The Kingdom Page School has the responsibility of teaching the
	children of the Kingdom all about the SCA, Event Safety
	Midevel (sp?) History, etc.  There are classes and such. There
	are local chapters and tutors.  A recent developement is the
	Adopt-a-Peer program.  Peers in the Kingdom volunteer about
	a half hour per child and teach them about some aspect of the
	society or their peerage.  ie: A laurel for armour would teach
	the child about armour, a pelican would teach the child about
	service etc.  This has the advantage of not only being fun for
	the children but it teaches them about the SCA.

Similar programs can be adopted in other Kingdoms.  The children of
current members are our future.  The more we can integrate them
into the SCA the more the SCA can grow and progress.

Why did we have so many allies this year?  I'm not entirely certain
since I wasn't in on the negotiations, but I did see a number of things.

Last year we had so many allies because of Eislinn & Talymar's negotiations.

This year we still had Talymar negotiating for us, and possibly a little
bit of the ghost of Eislinn was with us still.  There were murmurings that
the king of the east was hard to get along with ... but I saw no evidence
of this, other than one of the east kingdom baronies signed up for guard
duty at the midrealm front gate -- ostensibly because they were upset
over something their king did.  But this was the same incident which
was reported in the paper where one of the people of this barony assigned
his squire to guard duty -- his squire being the king of the east --
and Talymar (seeing the king of the east standing guard duty at
our Royal Encampment) immediately took up guard duty at the East's
Royal Encampment!

Talymar is *very*good* at doing negotiations.  He is *very*good*
at doing official court-speak and acting 'right'.  If the east
were to develop/find someone as good ... that would be alright.

I don't have any problem with the alliances being one-sided like
they have been.  (And it's not just because I'm on the winning side
of this either).  It's a good simulation.  The Middle has apparently
had a long history of being good at getting alliances.  There's the
story of the Great Cookie Bribe for instance -- Atlantia had
habitually been allied with the East until one year when someone
in the Middle had a brilliant idea of sending chocolate chip cookies
to some event in Atlantia.  (Along with an envoy).  When it came
time to make alliances, the Atlantian king told the East something
like "YOU didn't send us ANY cookies!".

Stuff like that adds to the flavor (sorry) of the whole affair...

I have the strong belief that Chris was never King of the West before moving to

This is also one of my favorites. I'll mark a couple of key differences
that make a difference in the mood of the song (as opposed to valid
oral tradition variation). My source is Bronson's "Traditional Tunes to

That's "Mighty Queen", not Mary. (Mary's like on earth certainly

Here's the missing verses:
O see ye not yon narrow road
So thick beset with thorn and briars?
That is the path of righteousness
Though after it but few enquires.

And see ye not that braid braid road
That lies across the lily leven?
That is the path of wickedness
Though some call it the road to Heaven.

...Again, one of my favorite songs. Some scholars suggest that Thomas the
Rhymer is related to (or equal to) Tam Lin; I disagree...

In digest #95, Lord Zhilnikov states that the West was the first "Kingdom".
This is not quite the case.  While it is true that the SCA started in Ca.,
there was no "Kingdom" of the West until after the creation of the East
"Kingdom". Prior to that time there was no need to name "Kingdoms" because
there was only one called "The SCA". (can you guess which kingdom I'm from)
I realize this is a technicality, I thought that the world might want to know
(of course I could be wrong) btw, I am grateful for the list of kingdoms

This is from Lady Anastasia Knutovna, also desultorily from Myrkfaelinn:
----------------------------Original message----------------------------
Wendy,
   I was going to bring in 30 reference copies of the Ballad of Thomas
the Rhymer, but then I got lazy and recalled that the stanzas that are
missing are always more or less the same (evidence of their popularity
and memorability), though versions of the ballad do vary.

     See you not yon narrow road,
     So thick beset with thorns and briers?
     That is the path of righteousness,
     Though after it but few enquires.

     And see you not yon broad, broad road,
     That lies along the lily leven?     (or:  stretches o'er the lily leven)
     That is the path of wickedness,
     Though some call it the road to heaven.

     And see you not yon bonny road,
     That winds about the green hillside?
     That is the road to fair Elfland,
     Where you and I this night must ride.

     (The road to Elfland can also "wind about the meadow low...
                                    Where you and I this night must go,"
                                    just for variety.)

The medley of tunes that Steeleye Span uses is also, as far as I can tell,
modern; the source for older tunes is "The Traditional Tunes to the Child
Ballads," a large reference work that well-equipped music libraries might
have (Cornell's does).  None of the tunes are known to be as old as the
ballad, but there is one that Sir Walter Scott referred to in the 1700s
as "the ancient melody."

Having recently run a grand march of 11 of the 12 Kings of the Knowne
World, I happen to know the order of the Kingdoms off the top of my
head.  For anyone interested, it is below, along with notes of
Principalities. 

West: Includes Principalities of the Mists (Central CA), Cynagua
(Nevada & soem of CA (I think)), Oertha (Alaska), and Lochac
(Australia).  The West also includes shires in various Pacific
locations, including Japan, Korea, Guam, etc.

East: Includes Principality of Drachenwald, which is all lands across
the Atlantic Ocean.  Currently, Drachenwald exists in Germany, Italy,
England, Sweden, the Netherlands, and a few scattered members in Egypt
and other spots.

Middle: Includes the brand-new Crown Principality of Ealdormere, which
is in Ontario and other parts of Canada.  Can anyone tell me if I got
the spelling correct on that one? 

Atenveldt: Includes the Principalities of the Sun and of Artemesia.

Meridies

Caid: Includes a barony in Hawaii and a shire in New Zealand.

Ansteorra

Atlantia: Includes (from time to time) one or more floating shires
aboard US Navy ships based in Virginia.

An Tir

Calontir

Trimaris

Outlands:  Includes a few members in northern Mexico.

I attended a Boar hunt hosted by the the Canton of Lionsdale this summer. I
wouldn't normally pay attention to fighting rules but they were reveiwing
them right in front of us...

It was basically done as a woods battle, and the three boars were the top
three fighters at the event (it just happened to be that way - they had all
been asked to play 'boar' before the event.) They carried sword and shield
if I remember correctly and were given time to hide in the woods before the
'hounds' were let loose. The hounds were a group of older kids (10-13 yrs I
think) who were treated according to standard light rules (within 15ft -
"Hound! You're dead!") and only allowed to bark, bay or howl.  Then the
fighters were allowed into the woods with polearms, swords etc only
- no shields. Each boar had 5 lives (5 ribbons) and a ribbon was given
to the hunter who struck the killing blow. ** Boars had a slow count of
5 between the killing blow and when they had to fall down. **  (Time to
run up the spear or kill a hunter, I suppose.) As a prize was being given
for the most kills/ribbons, the ribbon had to be carried back to camp and
presented to the listmistress after each kill.

Hunt Stories:
At the beginning of the Hunt, the three boars set up a co-operative ambush
and killed half the hunters in the first few minutes. The hunters returned
to camp and were resurrected.

I heard that "poachers" lay in wait for the unwary fighter carrying his
"carcass" back to camp.

I also heard how young Aelfgar, who only started fighting as a light this
summer, managed to kill Duke Sir Eirik Thorinsson all by himself. I think
it took 3 arrows.

The fighting lasted until all three boars had been killed 5 times each. A
good two hours I think.

Any help?

Not according to the local sources I've talked with, one being the county
health department and the other being one of the worlds most renowned
researchers on STD's and gynecological problems.

Now maybe there is some disagreement on terminology between here and there
but the fact remains that several people have contacted "SOME" protozoan
based urethral disorder that can cause swelling and discharge in males and
it is called Trichomoniasis by the local authorities.  Whatever the case may
be, there is a disease, people have tested positive for it after only being
in the swimming hole and not having sex in either the pool or at all (ever).

Call it what you want and try to deny the situation if you like, but if
people don't watch their ass (or urethra in this case) there is going to be
an epidemic within SCA that will be around for quite some time and will
cause much grief for many people.

If people are too irresponcible to get an exam at even the slightest hint of
infection then they shouldn't be in the water or having sex.  Period.  This
is nothing to mess around with and I for one would find it hard not to punch
out a person that said they had been in the swimming hole and had not getten
tested yet still had the nerve to have sex with someone else.  I'm fighting
mad over this, almost murderously so.

Message-Id: <2860@pt.cs.cmu.edu>


Two people have tested positive already of the five that went, since they went
as a group the last three got prescriptions without even being tested.  One
of the people that tested positive had no symptoms.  I had only a slight
itch but I know enough about such things that I got my tail over to the
clinic at first oportunity.  All those that have it so far either used
condoms for the times they had sex or had had no sex at all (ever).  The only
possible route of infection was the swimming hole.  Both the county health
department and a world renowned gynecologist (Dr Richard Hemphill) agree
that it can transmit via unchlorinated or unfiltered water. (both needed to
be safe)  They tell me it is a free swimming protozoan in water.

Anyone who had unprotected sex with anyone that had swum in the swimming
hole or lake or stream, or anyone who did the swimming described should have
themselves examined by a competent urologist.  I've found that the clinics
provided by the health department are not very good and often give false
negative readings.

Males: If you have any kind of itch or burning when you urinate or just
before or tendency for lint to stick to the opening of the urethra
particularly first thing in the morning then you probably have something.

Women often have no symptoms or just a little itching, redness, or swelling
as they would with a yeast infection.

Don't have sex until you are sure you're absolutely safe.

Once I had the very same problem and they kept saying it was negative for
Trichomoniasis and eventually it got so bad that both of my testicles
swelled to the size of large oranges and hurt like hell.  I went to the
emergency room of a real hospital and they identified it as advanced Trich.
I was totally cured by them but I had to spend almost two and a half months
on my back with an ice pack on my groin.  This is not an exageration, I have
the medical records to prove it.  All this was after having played with the
health department people and their stupid tetracycline for almost three
months previously.  During that time they kept trying to say that it was
just Non-Gonococal Urethritis (NGU) and that the Tetra. would take care of
it.  Bullshit!  Health department clinics give you tetracycline as a sort of
cure all but it does very little good against the protozoans that cause
Trich.  It does help with just about everything else though.

This is not a disease to be messed with.  I say that everyone with even the
slightest suspicion should go to the health clinic and get checked.  If they
say you have NGU, try the treatment and if it doesn't go away and they say
you are negative for Trich. then you should go to a urologist because it is
probably Trich. with a false negative culture.

Pass this info to all your SCA friends that have any chance at all of having
this problem.  The longer we wait the more people outside the war and even
outside SCA that will be infected.  If nothing else they can come away from
the exam being a little surer that they haven't contracted anything.

The exam is usually free at health department sponsored clinics.

Re: East Kingdom Western Region Principality Straw Poll.  This is highly
unofficial word-of-mouth, rumour-mongering (My source is Sir Andreas Hak, who 
did the official tally) The official results will be announced shortly. 
However, the unofficial results are : Western New York State (Rhydderich Hael
[Buffalo,NY] to Coppertree [Syracuse, NY]) wants to be a Principality.  Northern
Outpost wants to go with the Northern Region, Stormsport [Erie, PA] wants to 
be in the Principality and Barony Marche of the Debatable Lands [hosts of the
Pennsic War] are confused.  They're pretty much evenly split on all the options.Look for official results (and the OFFICIAL POLL) to be out shortly.

Re: Thomas the Rhymour song.
I just published the entire song in the latest issue of *The Jongleur*,
the quarterly newsletter for the East Kingdom Jongleurs' Guild (for perform-
ing arts).  I'll look it up and mail it to the person who asked for it.

Re : Children at Events
I have a reputation in our barony (carefully cultivated of course) for being
able to fill in any dead time at an event by running games.  Needless to say,
autocrats appreciate this.  I found that this is something that everybody
can participate in equally.  Set aside an extra "list" area for games and
invite everybody to join.  Some advance selection of games may be necessary.
At first, I thought that some of the games would have to be "toned down"
for the children to compete on a par with the adults.  I found this was not
to be the case.  The adults had trouble keeping up with the kids!  

Prequel to war story:
The War Puppies, in an effort to keep everyone aware of the AIDS problem,
put up posters on most of the porta-castles with pictures of Sir Horic and
the words "Sir Horic says:" followed by assorted slogans such as : "Always
sheathe your weapon" and "Safe in battle - Safe in sex"

War story:
In the woods battle, East and allies controlled the top of the hill with
the banner, the Midrealm and allies were attempting to climb up.  One
fighter at the top turned to me (I was scouting) and said, 
	"Time for the grenades."
	"Grenades, m'lord?"
I followed him to a tree with a backpack resting against it.  He opened
it up to reveal over a dozen water balloons made from a package of condoms!
He picked up the backpack and proceeded back to the hillside, saying to me
over his shoulder, "Safe in sex, safe in battle!"

RE: Boar hunt.

  Actually we have already sort of sketched out a plan for this.
  We had in mind appointing a number of "BOARS" who would fight two-sword
  (or possibly two-dagger) and a number of hunters and archers.  The
  hunters would use spears or polearms and only be allowed to kill with
  an impalement.  (trying to slice up a boar really doesn't accomplish
  much more than getting him enraged...)  Of course to retain the spirit
  of the event the "boars" should not be to careful to avoid impaling
  themselves.  Also we figured there should be a minimum number of arrows
  to kill...I can't picture dropping a good sized boar with one arrow that
  was much less than an eye shot!

  Has anyone done this before?? Heard of it?   Any good ideas?

	To the best of my knowledge these are the kingdoms of the known world 
and where they reside.

1)	The West- The first Kingdom. Now consists of Northern California
	, Alaska, and Japan ( with the rest of the Northern Pacific).
	Also included (I believe ;-)) is the Principality of Lochac
	(Australia). Most of the population centers around the San 
	Francisco area (principality of the Mists). And I wish I could
	remember where Cygnua(sp) was.

2)	The East- The second Kingdom. The East includes the areas of 
	Pennsylvania, East to Delaware and everything North including 
	Quebec and the Maritime Provinces of Canada. Additionally the 
	Principality of Drachenwald (Europe) exists. Heavy Population 
	in the Boston area with major population up and down the sea-
	board. Also concentrations in Pittsburg (Debatable Lands) and 
	Buffalo (Rhyderich Hael).

3)	The Middle- The third Kingdom. The Middle consists of the states
	of Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Indiana,
	Illinois (the birthplace), and the Dakotas. In Canada the (New)
	principality of Eldermere exists (most of Ontario) as well as 
	shires in Manitoba and Saskatchwan ( at least for now).The pop-
	ulation is pretty spread out with primary numbers in a crescent
	from Chicago to East Lansing, Michigan down to Cleveland.

4)	Atenveldt- The fourth Kingdom. Atenveldt consists of Arizona,
	Utah, and I believe Montana and Wyoming( I could be wrong, 
	but you get the picture). The major population center is the
	Barony of Atenveltd (Pheonix).

At this point I get a little fuzzy off the top of my head in what order the 
other Kingdoms come in but you will get the Picture.

5)	Meridies- Consists primarily of Florida, Alabama and Tenessee. 
	They broke off from Atenveldt some time back.

6)	An Tir- The Pacific Northwest well describes An Tir. They consist of 
	Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia as well as Idaho and Alberta.
	They were an offshoot of the West Kingdom.

7)	Atlantia- The Eastern Seaboard of the U.S. They consist of Maryland 
	through Georgia with major population centers in Washington D.C. and
	Atlanta.

8)	Caid- If one city could become a city wouldn't you know it would be
	Los Angeles. Thrown in with them is Los Vegas, San Diego and yes
	New Zealand ( Had to break that 5 hour drive from one side of the 
	kingdom to the other.;-)) And yes they broke off from the West 
	Kingdom.

9)	Ansteora- The States of Texas and Oklahoma comprise most of this 
	Kingdom. I seem to remember that the population is concentrated in 
	the North and South with large stretches of nothing in between.
	This is another of the Atenveltd splinter Kingdoms.

10)	Calontir- The great plains (Oh the land is very flat in Calontir...)
	Consists primarily of Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, 
	Much of the population of Calontir is in Saint Louis 
	and Kansas City. Calontir is an old Principality of the Middle Kingdom.

11)	Trimaris- The Deep South. They consist of Mississippi, Louisiana
	and Arkansas (I think). This is another of the splinter Kingdoms
	of Atenveldt.

12)	Outlands- The Outlands are the States of New Mexico, Colorado and 
	some other sheep herding areas :-) out there. They are the most recent
	Kingdom to be created. Guess what kingdom they are from originally. 
	Yep Atenveltd...


	Disclaimer: This is by no means complete, though I have tried. If
	I got the wrong state or province in the wrong Kingdom feel free to
	correct me.


P.S. What are my phone bills going to be like now that my roomate is on the

Thank you for the information!  It was more complete than the information
I had gathered and would have posted.  I have just a couple of small
additions.

To be more exact (;-), Atenveldt has all of Arizona, Utah, and Montana,
eastern Idaho, western Colorado and Western Wyoming.  They may
actually have all of Idaho but I haven't kept up on recent
developments.  Atenveldt also has major population areas around
Tuscon, AZ and Salt Lake City, UT.  Everything else is pretty spread
out.

Correct, once, but the Kingdom of Trimaris later split off of
Meridies and consists primarily of Florida plus a little bit north of
Florida.  Plus I think there may be a couple of other states in there,
like may Georgia or Louisiana.  Help, anyone from Meridies?

As I mentioned, at least southeastern Idaho is a part of Atenveldt.

All of Texas is in Ansteorra except the city of El Paso, which is part
of the Outlands.  You'll understand why, if you look at a map.  

>11)	Trimaris- The Deep South. They consist of Mississippi, Louisiana

As I mentioned, Trimaris split off of Meridies and contains Florida,
for sure, and I'm not sure what else.  We need someone from Meridies
and from Trimaris to give us exact information here.

>12)	Outlands- The Outlands are the States of New Mexico, Colorado and

The Outlands contains eastern Wyoming, eastern Colorado, all of New Mexico,
and the city of El Paso Texas.  Actually, it follows the Continental Divide
up to Montana on the western side, and then uses state borders to
delineate the edge on the eastern side.  The largest areas of population
center around Denver, Colorado and Albuquerque, New Mexico.

It was more complete than mine!  Thanks for the help!

As to Duke Christopher of Hoghten, he joined the SCA in California where
he reigned as King.  Later, he moved to Phoenix, which is and was part of
Atenveldt.  He and his lady, Constance, reigned as King and Queen of
Atenveldt when that kingdom covered what is now Atenveldt and the Outlands.
He now lives in Denver, Colorado, and he and his lady, Cymber, are the
current King and Queen of the Outlands.

I recently came across a record on the Hyperion label featuring the
Broadside Band playing late 16th/early 17th dance music (Caroso and
Negri).  The record gave the address of the Dolmetsch Society in
England and stated that written sources for the dances were available.

Has anyone used these?  If not, would anyone like the address?

I have no opinion in the matter, because I haven't been in the SCA long
enough to form an enlightened opinion. My impression, from talking to a
lot of people at Pennsic, is that many people were unhappy with the
East. Most of the comments stated personal dislike for the actions of it's
rulers, particularily the Queen. Many people were extremely upset at the
way Pennsic XVII was autocrated, and of the politics that produced the
problems.

From this I draw the conclusion that the politics of not supporting the
East this year are probably the result of previous Eastern politics that
upset a great deal of people.

Me too!  Out here in Three Mountains (Portland, OR) we have tapes and dance 
instructors, but almost NO scored music to play from.  I can't make the same 
promise to transcribe from tape, but at least if some kind soul will send
*music*, I'll be the local repository.  I'll learn the music and distribute 
copies whereever I can.

    I would not advocate an SCA standard dance book; people have their
    own favorite arrangements of things, and as long as they're playable
    and danceable, I don't care how they're arranged.  

I agree, even in my limited (NW Coast) exposure, I've seen multiple versions
of dances and tunes.  But I can learn new ones, if I have the music!

    What we need to do is wave wildly and yell and scream if we have something 
    we're willing to send someone so people can tell where to get these 
    wonderful dances that we're missing.

I'll add my voice to those clamoring for sources, at least, and as I said,
be the local repository, since I think I'm the only local alt.sca reader
who also dances (not to mention barding, but that's a different subject).
Anyone out there who's semi-local and wants to help/contradict is welcome
to do so.

wait a minute.  trichomoniasis is a SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE.  unless you
were fornicating in the swimming hole with someone who had it, you cant get it.
(according to a local doctor here -- we called to check).


maybe you mean Trichinosis?  (the parasite you can get from uncooked pork,
rabbit, or venison) or something else similar?  as far as i know, 
trichomoniasis is a bacteria, not a protozoa.  trichinosis is not a bacteria,
it is a worm-type parasite.

It has been most interesting to read all the stories from Pennsic.
For us who have never been there, older stories would also be inte-
resting. There must certainly be a treasure of stories about funny
things that have happened at the War. If there is anyone who feels
like it, I'd appreciate reading more such stories.
For instance, there is a guy called "Cid Caid" who reputedly got
this name at Pennsic. How?

The story I heard was that many of the reigning monarchs this year were
either squire brothers or friends of Corwin and Reynard. I'm not sure about
Meridies, but I know that TRH Reynard and Brunhildr are great folks and are
well thought of in their old home in Storvic. I was suprised Atlantia didn't
ally sooner.

The way I heard the story about the monument to where Michael of Bedford
fell goes:

Michael is a trickster, known of old for his enjoyment of getting hold of a
reigning monarch at the war, getting them falling down drunk, and then
leading them through camp. This trick has caught many in the past, to the
great amusement of the perpetrator.

This year, Michael attempted to catch Good King John Bearkiller of
Meridias (Sorry about the spelling, I'm happy to get "EAST" right). Now,
King John is well known for his high ideals, his just decisions, and a
merry sense of humour. Actually, whether Michael was trying to get Good
King John royally drunk is a guess and a moot point. This was a case of
"the biter bit."

As Good King John was escorting Michael back to his camp, the humours of the
grape overcame him. He fell as if struck to the ground. This happened
opposite the main Atlantian campsite. One wag commented: "It's a shame it
was not the Atlantian Royal encampment, else the Crown might have observed
him in the proper possition for the first time in years."

As to the "Shrine," when first I saw it, it was a mere marker. The addition
of the "Eternal Flame" was soon followed by the body outline and the gifts
of empty bottles. I know not who contributed, but it is a wonder how fast a
thing can grow.

I did not contribute and repeat this story as closely as I can remember. If
I have erred, please correct me, if I have slandered, I am sorry.

Does Anyone remember the Lion's Gate/Dreiburgen war?  Around AS XII or XIII
or so?  That was fun.  Barons Gerhard and Waeldt decided to have a war because
they were the two most widely separated Baronies in the West (AnTir and Caid
were both principalities at the time).  It was fun to shout insults at each
other at Crown tourneys and so on.  Eventually the Barons fought it out
in single combat.  I seem to recall that the King forbade an all out war
so as to preserve fighters for when we sacked the MIddle :-)  I heralded
that bout;  My baron won and I got this nice Lion's Gate dancing girl as
"spoils of war";  Baron Sir Waldt von Markheim was nothing if not generous to
his vassals.

Sometimes, reading this digest, I feel a bit like Rip van Winkle will feel.  You
see, I used to be active in the Society, but it's been at least seven years and
maybe as much as ten.  When I last saw the situation, I seem to recall there
being either five or six kingdoms: West, Middle, East, Atenveldt, Caid (fairly
recent), and Atlantia (even more recent?).  Now I see reports from the War that
there were no less than eleven royal pairs and that the West was not even so
represented.  Thus, I infer that there must now be at least 12 kingdoms.  I have
seen the following names:
	West
	Middle
	East
	Ansteorra (this sounds familiar; am I just forgetting
	           its existence from before?)
	Atlantia
	Caid
	AnTir (I seem to recall them getting ready to make the
	       leap from principality to kingdom)
	Outlands
	Trimaris
	Calontir
	Meridies (this also sounds familiar; I now think that I'm
	          very confused about what was so when I was a 
	          member...)

Notably, I have not seen the name ``Atenveldt'' mentioned.  Also, my old friend
Christopher of Houghton, once of the Mists in the West, was at one time King of
Atenveldt but is now mentioned as the King of the Outlands.  It could be that he
moved (again), but perhaps what once was Atenveldt is now the Outlands?

If someone could send out a complete list of the current Kingdoms and their
mundane-world geographical extent, I would be appreciative.  If that list went
further and included all of the current principalities as well, I would be more
deeply thankful.  If someone could go even further and provide a history of
Society geography (when and where each kingdom and principality was formed), I
would be completely ecstatic.

I thank you in advance, whoever you be, for your generosity in this matter.

Subject: West / An Tir War

My mailer also did not like Lady Elizabeth's address.

Our guys had a real good time fighting your guys, too.  This is the
second year I've gone, and both were really fun.  I am a squire, so I
liked the strange 'horsed' battle.  {Knights had horses, so they could 
stand.  Squires rode their Knights' spare horses, so they too could stand.
If a Knight got legged (lost his horse), he would take the horse away from 
the poor squire.  Non-knights and non-squires were on their knees to 
simulate not having horses.  Royal peers could have two squires in the 
battle, regular old Knights could only have one.  This made for 
really interesting tactics.}

I truly wish I could attend more An Tirian events; all the An Tirians 
I've met have been very cool people.  I almost made it to Egil's two 
years ago, but the head gasket on my truck blew out in the middle of
California Nowhere.  My squire-brother is John Theophilus (John 
the Bofftist), and he does go to many events up there.  I wondered,
though, why so many events are held in the extreme southern reaches of
An Tir (Adiantum).  That can't possibly be central, and has to be
several hours' drive for you.  I'd also like to know when another 
Seargeants' Tourney is to be held.  John wrote in and got permission to
enter one, and we want to get the idea going down here.  

Yes, I hope that more Westerners will show up at next years' War.  All
of them.  You guys fight a lot more than Caid.  There were seven or
eight battles at our last war, and only three at West-Caid.  (Yes, I'll
bet they call it Caid-West, too  :-))

Minors (< 18 years) are permitted at the War only in the company of parents or
guardians.  A friend or non-parent relative temporarily appointed is, alas,
*not* sufficient.  Waivers of release are not sufficient.  This is a relatively
recent rule.

It has kept several good friends away from the War, since there are obviously a
lot of minors whose folks aren't Scadians.  It also got some younger-looking
folks "carded" regularly.  I can see the reasoning behind it, especially with
all the liability concern of late, but it's still a problem for many people in
the Society.

Actually, my local Baron (confined to a wheelchair and user of computer
networks) was interested three years ago about starting up a board on
Compu$erve and contacted them...  After getting the information packet and
starting to fill it out the Baron decided to wait for some individual (whom
only he knew) that had a database of SCA information (Compuserve loves
database files...)  And the project has sat evermore..

Looking at Genie has been tempting, what I need is a good sample of the
numbers of SCA that would use the system.

If EVERYONE would send me a short note stating that they are a member of
the SAC I would get a estimate to members/readers.

One note: In Sunset Shire for many years, there was a children's
tourney at their annual event. I have been out of touch with them for a
few years, but attended two such tourneys. Because the children were
the focus of several things going on there, there were no perceivable
problems with children. 

The people who showed up like kids. Most of them were parents.
The rest liked the kids as persons there.

Events included pin the tail on the dragon, apple bobbing and something
strange with pumpkins (I forget what it was - they were in a pumpkin
farming area and there were often surpluses). The kids were very busy.
The grownups had fun playing go and cheering the kids on.

I recommend it for every largish event.

I didn't get over to the archery shoot so please excuse if this is off base
but it would seem to me that the type of moving target commonly used by
mundane rod and gun clubs for moving targets would be quite useful here.

What they use is a foam replica that runs on a little track like a train
track and you lay the track down a hillside.  The trajectory and speed are
the same for all competitors so the puller is not important and it is quite
easy to place obstacles along the path so that one must gauge their effect
and time your shot accordingly as well.  Would this be a reasonable thing?

I just want to say that the Settmore (sp) Swamp people who were assigned
security duty for this year did what looked like a great job to me and
were a really great bunch of people.  Dillon and Angus kept their cool while
busting their tails.  The didn't get fascist but they got the job done very
well from what I saw.

I also want to recomend that people volunteer for security patrol if they
aren't busy and want something interesting to do.  It's a real blast and you
get to meet interesting people.  I missed the one bad night so I can't give
a good idea of how that felt from the working end.  It's pretty funny
watching what comes in to lost and found too.  "Hey you should've seen the
battleship that just came through here."  "I'm with that battleship."

Hoof in mouth anyone?  Wash it down with Lynchburg maybe?

Message-Id: <2794@pt.cs.cmu.edu>


On Friday (a week before the war) I finally gave in to the requests and
bribes of several friends to go to Pennsic and see what the SCA was like at
it's best.  So in the course of four hours we threw stuff together and
bought supplies and cruised to the war, arriving at about 2 am to be greeted
by the familiar face of Robin at the Troll Booth.  (note:  while new to SCA,
I have known several BMDL people fpr several years)  The three of us (names
withheld so they can fill in as they desire) were 875, 876 and 877.  We
pitched camp with the Elves on what was called Elves hill (between the Arts
and Sciences tent and the Pages tent) in the middle of the night and crashed.

The first day (for me) was Saturday and was pretty slow, most merchants
weren't there yet and not too much partying was going on.  Since it was
going slow at first I pondered the issue of visiting some relatives that I
dislike that live near the war site and got pretty bummed by the idea.  (For
those persons I sort of ignored at first, this is the reason, semi-catatonia)

I came back on Tuesday and by then things were in full swing, a pretty fair
amount of partying was kicking in and I got to meet a lot of great people.

The party at Cloven Shield was awesome, great bonfire too.  Lynchburg at
Settmore (sp) Swamp was great, Badger Brew was fantastic, Bedford camp
really knows how to stock a liquor cabinet, Rocket Fuel at Confed was high
octane to be sure.

What else can I say?

The atmosphere of chivalric courtesy, beautiful ladies, clear starlit skies,
the charm of natural flame lighting and period music, shooting stars
uncountable while you lie in archers field with close friends, Shenai (sp)
playing, bonfires, Security people and patrol, party hopping, great garb,
and most of all a massive collection of truly fascinating people gathered
for a great time.

The bad part?  It's not long enough!  The good part?  I have a whole year to
get ready for next year!  No Prisoners!

Subject:  Music for dancing

I have attended events where the music for the dancing was all tape (Thescorre,
my home Barony, does it this way) and where music is all live (Myrkfaelinn).  I
must admit, I could go either way or a combination of the two.  I won't repeat
the obvious reasons for live music (atmosphere is a biggie), but I will give you
some reasons for tape:  it allows the musicians an opportunity to dance, it
allows those groups with no musical consort to have dancing (we've tried in
Thescorre to have instrumental practices and they never seem to go very far), it
gives us (the dancers) a chance to dance something new.  Enough said.  (I can't
comment on the War since I was unable to go, but the 10:30 pm start time for
dancing is a little discouraging.)

Re: Strip the Willow.  All you need is a jig or a reel (I don't know the diff.
but I'll find out) that has a fairly fast beat.  I can try explaining the dance
but it is easier to see it and do it.  Thescorre has a tape of (jigs or reels)
that lasts close to 30 minutes, which is about the length of time a reasonable
line of people can dance it.  It is exhausting, fun, and great exercise!

(to Malice : There are some very good dance *masters* too.)

Subject:  Pennsic War Stories

So far, I have heard a lot of good things about Pennsic XVII.  However, I have
heard one thing that greatly disturbed me.  Apparently there was a great deal of
theft at Pennsic this year, more so than in the past.  In fact, what I have
heard is of things being stolen that are beautiful, unique, and encompassing
many hours of crafting to create.  To me, this sounds like stealing for the sake
of stealing or stealing by people who do not appreciate what goes into the items
we create.  I am really upset to hear about it!  What kind of person would do
this and is this what the SCA is coming to?  I hope not, but how do we protect
ourselves from it?

Subject:  Children at Pennsic

(this is it, I promise!)
I would like to hear about the pages school in particular and children at
Pennsic in general.  My birth daughter and my SCA-foster daughter will be
attending Pennsic with us in the future and I would like to get some stories and
impressions from others about children and the war.  Thanks!  

I would also like some impressions about how well or poorly the restriction on
minors was enforced.  

My SCA-foster daughter is 16, has been in the SCA for 4 years and received her
AOA at 13.  She was promised that she could attend Pennsic when she turned 16
because we figured by then she would know the SCA well enough to be able to
handle the War.  Now, she can't attend for another two years, and we are all
much too honest to try and violate the Cooper's ruling.  Besides, if we did
sneak her in somehow, what kind of model would that be for my own daughter?  It
seems a shame that one or two people have to spoil the war for those who have
every right to be at the biggest SCA event of the year, but I certainly can't
blame the Coopers for the decision they had to make.

A grim word of warning to folks that swam in the swimming hole at Pennsic.
Apparently the protozoan for Trichomoniasis was found in the water for the
swimming hole.  This pest can infest the urinary and sexual organs and can
cause other problems as well.  Wearing a suit is no help against it either.

So if you were in the swimming hole a the war, get checked for Trich.

Sorry to be a stick in the mud but I just got the scoop and I think it is
very important the this sort of thing get checked early.  This can also be
transmitted sexually.  You should wait about 1.5 weeks after the last time
you were in the swimming hole and then get an exam.  The good part is that
it is easily treatable and does little damage if caught early.  Don't
believe the rumors that it is no big deal in men, I had it once and my
testicles welled up to the near bursting point and it REALLY hurt.  I had to
spend two months flat on my back with ice on my groin, not fun.

So please, for your sake and the sake of your partners and their future
partners and anyone you o rthey might swim with, get the exam and follow the
precautions that are prescibed.

     This was only my second war but both times I have been fortunate to be 
with people and organizations I am truly proud to say I belong with.
     This year I had the honor of being a shieldman in Eislinn's Guard. My 
choice was easy, as I knew Eislinn while she was still alive and admired her 
greatly.
     Many stories have gone around about what we did at war this year. During 
the bridge battle we captured not only the Eastern banner, but the banners of 
Drachenwald and Trimaris as well. The Trimarin banner was for the second time 
and therein lies the story.
     The first( and second) time we captured the battle standard of Trimaris, 
Sato, a fighter from I believe Septemptria came out of the field battle with 
the banner. Needless to say we were overjoyed at this, and when we took the 
banner to his Grace, Duke Sir Talymar, he decided that we as a unit should 
return the banner.
     We arrived at the Trimaris royal encampment shortly before the King, and 
after a short wait the whole group of us was admitted into his Majesties 
presence. Talymar with the help of Sato returned the banner. The only ransom 
asked for was one bottle of beer for Sato.(we think he liked their beer so 
much he went after the other banner later;-) At this point Talymar begged a boonof the King of Trimaris and that was that one of the favors Eislinn had made 
the previous year stay with the banner. His Majesty of Trimaris at that got a 
little misty eyed as he told the small group about how in some small way he 
!could understand Talymar's loss, since his own wife had been away from him, in 
the hospital with an injury. One final request was then made, that a token of 
Her Majesty of Trimaris then be allowed to hang from the Eislinn banner.
     We all marched home knowing that we few people had witnessed something 
OAtruly special.

Subject: IKAC Answer

Before the War I inquired whether anyone knew why we were required to report
the number of arrows shot in an IKAC speed round.  (IKAC stands for
Interkingdom Archery Competition and is the standard shoot used to compare
archers across kingdoms.)  I conjectured that the requirement was a
bureaucratic fossil, but I didn't know.  Nor did anyone else.

So, at the War, I asked the marshals.  They didn't know either:  The only
person reputed to know was Lord Hawkwind, who compiles the IKAC scores.  So I
asked him (once I found him).

Confirmation!  Those numbers were requested, once upon a time, with the vague
notion of doing some analysis.  They are not used.  When they arrive they are
thrown out or ignored.  And Hawkwind doesn't give a flying feather whether they
are reported or not.

Isn't inertia a wonderful thing?

Do It!

Four ingredients are required.

--Dance instructions.
--Written music, for consorts.
--Dance tapes.
--Live instruction, to pass on the nuances that instructions can't teach.

A forum such as an inter-kingdom dance letter would enable us to organize
something useful in all four categories.  It would be nice to be able to put
together a "package" of fifty or so of the best dances (is a hundred too many?)
in all four media by next year, for general distribution.

Subject: anecdotes etc.

My fighting unit, numbering all of four, allied itself with the good
and noble king of Trimaris, and so fought for the East.  Trimaris 
was to hold the small far bridge on Sunday, and darn near succeeded.  
The two shieldwalls (both excellent) advanced to just outside pike
range and stayed there for the better part of an hour, hurling taunts
and insults worthy of Monty Python Meets Camelot.  The marshals were
wishing for tape recorders as the Midrealm and Trimaris forces assaulted
and insulted each other.  A local hold was called for water, and the 
marshals poised over the haybales with staves crossed, and called the
lay on.  Chaotic noise then erupted as both sides hollered and shook weapons as
menacingly as they could; then most were laughing as they realized the
walls had not moved an inch.  Eventually the Middle broke through one
of the other bridges and pressed in from both sides.  Only two minutes
from the cannon shot the last Trimarian fell.  

It WAS obvious to the 20 or so Westerners there that the royalty was
not.  I have the impression that many Westerners think that 3000 miles 
is just too bloody far to travel, even for something as big as Pennsic. 
They even scheduled the Kingdom Collegium on Pennsic weekend.  I and others
are going to try to raise some consciousness on this issue, but you see, 
we have this duke that seems to want to be king every other tourney, and 
he will probably win next March Crown.  He's not much for wars.  (I traveled
the distance; you can guess how I feel about wars) 

Speaking of Kingdoms and such, how did it come to be that the Middle had nine
allies, while the East got one by the skin of their teeth (actually by 
giving many slots in the champions' battles)?  Is this politics of the sort
we'd like not to see in the SCA?  It looked bad, and I hope that next 
year will see a more even division of forces.

Subject: East Kingdom and Principalities

I inquired about the straw poll concerning a principality in the East.  I was
told that there's general agreement that the East Kingdom is too big; that
there is a good deal of support for a Principality -- somewhere -- but not any
particular location; and that there is no consensus on where to cut.

I will further note that as nearly as I am able to determine a) the major
advantage of a principality is that some day it will be a kingdom and b) the
custom that a principality take years and years to become a kingdom is not
grounded in law.  So how's this for a suggestion:

Instead of looking for extremities to bud off, partition the East Kingdom into
4-6 principalities, with the stated intention that they become a confederation
of kindgoms within 1-2 years.

Subject: liability & litigation...them's fighting words :-)

In most societies it is the people who can not resolve their problems in a
civilized manner who go to court.  In our society (US, and according to
apparent assumptions the BOD of the SCA) it is assumed to be the civilized
thing (or at least the default) to go to court.

To me, it seems that we are dealing with a matter of economics of risk.  The
BOD thinks that one f***ed up person suing the SCA and getting away with it
because of the litigous court system would have the financial potential
to drive the society out of existance.

There seem to be a number of scadians, on the other hand, who feel seriously
culturally threatened by the CYA policies that the BOD legislates (Malice,
etc.).

Thus the question is:  will we die of catastrophic loss through financial
ruin from litigation, or will we die of slow rot from bureaucratic overload
on what is supposed to be an entertaining diversion, not a regulated chore.

If I were *really* a troublemaker--if I were really into inflammatory
verbiage--I might ask if we wanted to fight gallantly and die gloriously for
king and country, or if we preferred to be piddled to death by lawyers?
However, I am sure it would be contrary and unladylike to propose such a
thing (just as neither would my lady Malice), and I should leave the issue
alone.

Besides, I don't fight, I just have to listen to everybody row about it...

Seriously, I am pretty new to the society, but this seems to be a very big
issue (at least among some of the people I have spoken to in my area) that
is sharply delineated and fostering more heat than light in discussion.  I
think that this may be because it is a complex situation which probably
doesn't have a *right* answer.  People who are technically competant to
discuss the legal aspects are trained to view situations in terms of
liability; people who have a feeling that the regulation is threatening to
their cultural base have very little vocabulary in common (or patience? :-)
with the lawyers. 

Is there some forum to discuss this in less than absolutes, where it would
mean anything to the people who are setting policy?  Or is there just a lot of 
hot wind being generated.  Is the BOD representative of local opinion in any
way?  What choice is there in choosing risks?

Subject: War Stories


Peace be upon all of you, Gentle Listeners.

I had a wonderful time a Pensic this year, despite a touch of Mr.
Virus (semi-official name for it at Herald's point) on Sunday, and the
distinct lack of good storytelling fires on Monday night.

For those of you keeping score, in fencing, the three man-melee
tourney was won by the team "Admit-it your dead" composed of Iciar
Albar de Montesios y Aragon, Roderic of Basing and Bryn Llyr of
Cynwyd.  The Double-elimination fencing tourney was won by Fionnbharr
mac Roech who defeated Sym of Clan Fraser in the finals.

For those of you who were not keeping score, some war stories.

------------------------------------------------------

An Eye-Witness Account of the Goings On in the Woods Battle:  with
reports from other gentles to supplement my account.

by Mustapha al-Muhaddith
     ..          .

As I am not a fighter, but am instead a Marshal of Fence, I fought the
Woods Battle this year with the Chiurgeons, doing service as a Magic
Marshal.  By a B.O.D. ruling two years ago, water-bearers and
chiurgeons are not allowed into the woods without an escort by a
marshal to see to their safety.  Because every fighter who can would
like to enter the woods at Pensic, there is generally a shortage of
qualified marshals to perform the escort duty.  Now even as it is true
that a true marshal must have sound judgement and knowledge on many
matters, such as the strength of blows and the quality of armor, an
escort for the water-bearers does not need such a diverse qualities.
Indeed, it is sufficient that that gentle be one of good sense, who
can usher the non-combatants away from the fighting, call hold if the
fight will overwhelm them, and, if need be, impose themselves between
the raging melee and the non-combatant with only a stout staff.
Perhaps I was hasty in calling the magic marshals individuals of sound
sense.  At any rate, my training as a fencing marshal was sufficient
for these purposes, and I was "magically" made a marshal for a day,
with strict instructions not to use my powers unless it was an
emergency.

At any rate, I fell in to muster at resurrection point.  There I was
assigned to a team consisting of two chiurgeons, and doctor named
Hussayn and a medic named Merwyn, and many water-bearers among them
Eowyn and Morgaine from my own encampment.  We named ourselves team
Nazrudin after that famed Mullah, and I even told a story of Nazrudin,
to explain to the others why that was so appropriate:


		Nazrudin at the Campfire

	After one of the fights against the invading Franj
	barbarians, the Mullah Nazrudin found himself sitting
	around a campfire with many Muslim warriors.  Each man
	spoke in turn, each telling of brave deads and fell,
	that he had done against impossible odds against the
	Christian hordes.  Each veterans story was more
	impossible than the last.  At last the gaze of the
	company shifted round to Nazrudin.

	I know, Nazrudin said to himself, that if I do not
	tell a story of some brave deed, these warriors will
	have sport with me, and I will spend the rest of the
	journey home enduring their cruel jests, and barbs.
	And yet, if I tell a lie, then I shall be held
	responsible for it on the day of reckoning.  So
	thinking, Nazrudin began this tale.

	"There I was, and in front of me stood a Christian
	night, he must have been all of 6 feet tall, and he
	was dressed head to foot in gleaming mail.  His sword
	shown bright as the sun, and I stood and faced him,
	dressed in rags, and bearing a sword that has perhaps
	been happier (and sharper) when it was a plowshare.  I
	cried out 'Allahu Akbar!'  [God is Great] and took a
	mighty swing, wherewith I cut off his leg."

	At this point, Nazrudin's tale was interrupted by one of
	the warriors who said, "Now, I would have gone for the
	neck.  Did you not know that cutting of the head the
	best way to deal with unbelievers."

	"Yes, yes," replied Nazrudin without thinking, "but
	somebody else had already done that."

Unfortunately, the chiugeonate was not as well organized as I have seen
them in the past.  The first gun had already given report, and the
Eastrealm forces were already entering the woods and setting their
defenses long before we were given leave to enter the woods.  Perhaps we
could have been spared some of the last minute instructions, which were
far too similar to the earlier instructions we had received, but Allah
alone knows all.  At any rate, at the second gun, the one that allowed
the midrealm scouts into the woods, we were given leave to enter.  

The rules for the woods battle were slightly different this year.  The
underage scouts were allowed 15 minutes (between the time of the second
and third guns which would mark the beginning of the actual fighting)
they were permitted into the woods to scout enemy emplacements.  We used
this time to find a good location for ourselves.  We chose the third
clearing up on the top of the causeway, and positioned ourselves in a
place which seemed to be clear of traffic, but within earshot of cries
for "Water" or "Chiurgeon."

We had no sooner placed ourselves, than the third gun sounded, and we
began to eagerly anticipate the fighting which would soon take place.
Last year, we had all been sorely disappointed when the bees had
invaded the main battle ground just before the clash of steel against
steel could commence.  This year we hoped for better.  While we
waited, Hussayn told us the story of how he had this year traveled
the trails looking for any possible place that the bees of foul temper
might nest, and had poored poison there to kill the dread pests.

Hussayn's story was interrupted by a rustling of armed men moving up
the hillside.  We saw the glint of red on their helms, and new that
they must be a midrealm force and we grew silent in anticipation of
the combat to come.  Sure enough, the midrealmers soon broke through
the trees and relatively quickly defeated the token Eastern forces in
the clearing.  The Midrealmers, whose purple and gold shield loudly
proclaimed them to be in fact from Calontir, this year allied with the
Middle, quickly moved up to the top of the hill and formed up a shield
wall.  

There is no Majesty and there is no Might, save in Allah, the
Glorious, the Great.  And surely the All-Knowing knows why they did
this thing, for I surely do not.  Perhaps they thought that even in
the woods word of the Calontir shield wall would strike terror into
the hearts of so many, just as it always does when they take the
bridge. It was far to early for them to convince any but the most
gullible of scouts that they had the banner with them, and I could see
no other reason for fighters to attack that shield wall.  Especially
not when they could sit and wait for the hot sun to tire the Calontiri
forces.

That is just what the next Eastrealm force to encounter the Calontir
shield wall did.  A band of about a dozen Eastern fighters, certainly
not more than a score, assigned (as I heard later from one of the
fighters from that band whose name I did not learn waiting in line for
the showers) to play "fire-brigade" and sure up the hot spots,
encountered them next.  As there were two or three score Calontiri
fighters on a very defensible, if hot hill, they chose instead to
retire to a shady spot and wait.  All the while we waited with them,
in the shade, wondering how to get water to the Calontir forces baking
in the afternoon sun.

The Eastern brigade must have sent for re-enforcements, because more
help arrived after about 10 minutes of waiting.  The help was in the
form of the brave warriors of the TuChux.  I silently applauded the
good sense of the Eastern strategist who had sent them.  The TuChux
those fierce and fell, do not wait well and hence make poor soldiers
in a siege.  But as far and bravely throwing themselves against an
entrenched enemy, you could find no better.  What better use for the
TuChux than to expend them in breaking up this band currently
entrenched in a foolish location but which might later form a valuable
force of reserves from the enemy.

With the arrival of the TuChux, the fight began in earnest and raged for
some five minutes before the marshals called a hold to clear the dead
from the field and to at last bring water to thirsty Calontir.  At
this point we could see, that while Calontir had suffered some losses,
there famed shield-wall was intact.  After they had drunk their fill,
we retire from the field and the fighting began anew.  After a few
minutes more, another hold was called.  This time followed by the cry
of "Chiurgeon."  Hussayn and Merwyn rushed to find one of the Calontir
shield-men down with a twisted ankle.  So they quickly splinted his
leg, and found two water-bearers (one TuChux, one Eastrealm) to take
him down the hill.  But with this problem, the patience of the TuChux
was exhausted.  The Chux had come to fight, and not to wait.  So the
marshal gave them permission to go find fighting elsewhere.

By the time the injured fighter was clear, more Easterners had moved
up to take the place of the departed TuChux.  In particularly, the
Were-Sheep (whom I saw) and House von Halstern (whose banners I missed
but whom several reliable people later told me were there) came to
help keep the now substantially reduced Calontir forces pinned on the
top of the hill.  The Were-Sheep were closest to me, and I saw several
Sheep valiantly call forth the Calontiri fighters to single combat.

At this point, my tale become somewhat less accurate.  For over the
course of the next few minutes, several Midrealm or allied forces
broke into the clearing, and several more Eastern forces moved in to
fill the gap.  The fighting was no longer confined to the top of the
hill, and I moved my party of non-combatants (which now included
several new water-bearers I had not started with) to relative safety.
Somewhere along the causeway in the lower part of the field, a fighter
took a blow to the ribs, and the Chiurgeons thought it best that he be
brought out of the woods by cart rather than on foot.  Therefore, I
and several other marshal formed a protective area around him while
waiting for the cart to arrive.  The fighting was thick and close
around us, and I lost track of who was who.  

When we had removed the injured fighter and the dust had settled, I
re-assembled team Nazrudin and took stock of our supplies.  We had
expended over half of our water, and so we thought it best to move
toward the re-supply point in the first field.  We traveled slowly in
that direction, for most of the fighting was moving that was as well.
We got to see many small combats, including one in which a fighter,
whom I do not know bested three of the enemy in order to win passage
through.  

When we got to the first field, and refilled our water supply, we
followed the fighters to the south.  At the southern edge of the
clearing, many Midrealm and allied forces (including the remnants of
the Calontiri shield-men) were milling about.  We found a lull in the
fighting and pressed forward for a closer look.  Just south of the
clearing, was a ravine.  On the other side of that ravine, were
Eastern fighters, and (as I later learned from Duke Sir Vissivald) the
Banner.  The Midrealmers were slowly and carefully sending men across
that ravine, in hopes of making a beachhead on the other side.  The
fighting was slow as there were only a few places were they could
safely cross.  Furthermore, time was running out, if they did not
capture the Banner shortly, the East would be proclaimed the victor.  

Alas, for the Middle, it was a dangerous place.  Not only did many of
their bold warriors fall prey to the Eastern pole-arms but many of
their ankles fell prey to the rough terrain.  At least two more were
carried down the hill on the cart, and perhaps if the fighting had not
been stopped for their fallen comrades, they might have won through.  

I have later heard from Duke Sir Vissivald (and before the tale had
much of a chance to grow in the telling) that he was on the other side
of that ravine playing "hero."  "I was in a secure place, sending
blows down upon the Midrealm fighters who would look up and say, 'Yep,
that's good,'" he said (or words to that effect).  "I was perfectly
safe, and killed a lot, so later I'll get credit for being a hero."  

Before the Middle could take the ravine, the final gun sounded
proclaiming the East the victor.  The fighters removed their helms,
drank our water, and swapped stories with people from all over the
Knowne World on the way down, foe now turned to friend.  I hailed many
I new on the way back down, and heard many a tale of brave deeds.

Of course, you may ask, how did the East manage to win the battle,
against such brave opposition?  Now this answer I have heard from Lady
Sindara herself, "The East won through superior Scouting."

-------------------------------------------

This tale has taken longer to tell than perhaps I reckoned at first.  I
have another, but perhaps I will save it for a later time.

Up here in An Tir talk of Pennsic is often accompanied by a sigh and a
far-away look. Talk to Baron Gerhard Kendal about The War and he'll give
you a mighty discourse on his favourite charity - "Send the Baron to
Pennsic".

In truth, the problem is multi-fold and involves various permutations of
lack of time/vehicle/money. A rather large group of Lionsgators (members
of the Barony of Lions Gate) went to TYC - so the distance wasn't the
deterrant. The biggest problem is getting the gear to where you're going.
How did you do it, Coranna?

since when has the range of an archer been less than that of a sheild wall?

it occurs to me that what we may want to do is not field battles with "combat 
archery", but an expanded version of a boar hunt.  half the fighters could go 
in the woods or field with spear and short sword with barking scouts and 
archers. and the rest could be boars with twosword, deer with single sword, 
and bunny rabits or birds with daggers.  This would provide an excuse for both 
the extreme short range and the blunt, heavy tipped arrows, which were used 
for hunting small game.

Olivier's movie Henry V didn't use real arrows either, it used lines drawn on

I was very pleased with the number of female faces in helms on the
field.  I also noted that a good number of the QUEENS were fighters,
too!  I know of Queen Alysandra of Caid, Queen Erika of Trimaris, 
Queen Angharad of AnTir, and Queen Cymber of the Outlands.  Any I
missed?  I'm happy that we're progressing beyond the point of "yes, 
women really can compete in this at the same level as men", and getting 
more Good Fighters out there.  

Through reading "Flower of Souvenance" and talking with others, I am
learning to my dismay that not all fighters who happen to be women have 
life as good as I do.  I am hearing tales of new fighters being pounded
into hamburger and being told 'You have to be tough enough to take
THIS'.  I've heard of scoffing, ridicule, and condescention.  What we 
must work toward now is the concept that NO new fighter should be
pounded on unmercifully, that ALL new fighters should have encouragement
and help, and access to decent training.  I don't care if someone's 
big or little, blue or purple or a tuchuk; if they want to learn to play 
our game by our rules on our turf, let them learn!  If they aren't 
interested they will go away; if they are, and are willing to practice
enough to become good, your unit, group, barony, kingdom, and the SCA
are better off for another courteous fighter.

Message-Id: <3313@c3pe.UUCP>


	At the most recent Pennsic War, I kept up my tradition of 
acquiring new songs so that I don't become bored with my repertoire.
A cooperative soul at the Cheshire Inn wrote down for me these lyrics
to the ballad "Thomas The Rhymer" (covered notably by Steeley Span).
The lyrics she gave me, by her own admission are, however; incomplete.
The most obvious gaps being two verses where, as Thomas and The Elf-Queen
are riding to Fairie, they pass by two roads. The Queen tells Thomas that
they're the roads to Heaven and Hell.  
	Is there anybody out there familiar with this song who knows of
these two verses, or any others missing or incorrect from this word of
mouth version that I posess?  I would also like to know any other
versions of this story. (It's a NEAT story!) Especially if they are
better than this one.
        Thanks in advance,

PS for any of you who were at Pennsic, I was the one walking around with
a guitar and mandolin on my back, a braid of purple and green around my 
hat, and a tambourine, mug and bowl on my belt that made a lot of noise
as I walked.  I played at the Cheshire Inn at dinner and was the lunatic
playing two recorders and a tambourine (with my foot) in the market sqaure.





		         Thomas The Rhymer

True Thomas lay on Huntley Bank
And there a marvel he did see,
A maid with flaming hair unbound
Came riding by the Eliden Tree.

She wore a gown of grass green silk.
She had a  mantle of velvet fine.
At every lock of her horses mane
Hung sixty silver bells and nine.

True Thomas he took off his cap
And bowed him low unto his knees
"All hail thee Mary, Queen of Heaven!
For your like on Earth was never seen."

"Oh No, Oh No, True Thomas," she said
"That name it does not belong to me.
I'm but the Queen of fair Elfland.
And it's fair far I've come to visit thee."

"Oh, harp and carp, True Thomas," she said.
"Come home with me to my own country.
I'll give to you a harp of gold,
A silken cloak and kisses three."

"To me the priest would bar the church
If I should hazard my soul with thee.
And what care I for harp and cloak?
-But I'll come for the sake of kisses three."

She turned about her milk white steed
And took True Thomas up behind;
The bells they rang in the horse's mane
The steed rode faster than the wind.

For forty days and forty nights
They rode in red blood to their knee.
And they saw neither sun nor moon
But heard the roaring of the sea.





"Do you see yon green green road
That winds across the ferry brae?
That is the road to fair Elfland
That you and I must take today."

True Thomas has him a harp and cloak
And kisses from the Elven Queen.
But seven long years were gone and past
Ere Thomas The Rhymer on Earth was seen.

To be honest, it was my first event. I'd been planning on going for many years
but hadn't been able to before now.
I arrived 4:20 am Saturday and was #5226.

I was impressed.

It was fun. It was alot of fun. All in all, although I was dissapointed by the
lack of Pennsic flood n, legends of which I'd been hearing for years and
although I had to put on socks (due to the cold) for the second time this 
summer, I had a great time.
Being encamped between the 2 Hordes, Setmour (sp?) Swamp and Confed (I was in
the hopefully someday dual-citizanship (Markland and SCA) Caer Edgemere 
encampment) I had an interesting view of life and was easily able to avoid
Tuchux hill.

As for the hill, the name I remember was Peers without tears, because the 
heralds weren't crying there.

Otherwaise, I say VIVAT! to the Confed camp (I'm the flautist from Sunday
night) and give more congrats to the Crown Principality of Eldermere. (If 
any Septentrians (sp?) are out there, get in touch.)

with minimal stops).  I like them better than I like some adults, and I 
imagine that they will do fine at an all-out event (they love fighting
practice, which is all they know right now).  Still, I don't want to bring
them where they are clearly not wanted.  Thus, I wanted to air some of my
views and get responses back from the net.gentry.  That said, I have some 
comments below:

That was unfortunate, especially as it will probably make you more loath to
see any kids at future events where they might even be perfectly well behaved.
While I think that *everyone* should give a kid and/or a parent with kids 
about double or triple the benefit of the doubt that would be afforded an 
adult alone, this must first be reciprocated.  Screaming children are no fun
for anyone to hear, but if someone must, then it should be those two who 
brought them into the world in the first place.

Well said.  As I said above, though, if someone is in fact doing their best
to be responsible for their kid(s), the very least you can do is not make
them feel guilty about having the kids in the first place (and a helpful
hand wouldn't hurt, if you feel up to it).  Even the best behaved children
cry sometimes, and parents have to deal with this as best they know how.
I won't make *any* excuses for screaming kids at a court, or running between
merchant's tables, but then not getting dirty looks about them simply being 
there would help too.

Actually, I don't think this is just between people with kids, though perhaps
those folks know the best what to watch for, having had some experience.  One
nice thing you childless gentles can do is to kindly but firmly lead a child
back to a parent if they start to wander and the parent doesn't see it; this
can happen.  Letting the child wander onto the tourney field and not stopping
them is just slightly worse than heaving the kid back with a curt "your brat
was loose again!"

Both true.  I have heard (alas, not attended) of a couple events where 
someone actually organized some things for the kids to do, such as learn
medieval colors, play SCA-tag, etc. (NOTE: this is *NOT* babysitting and
should not be abused as such).  In any event, parents should provide things
for their kids to do -- quietly if at all possible.

The astute reader will note that most of these should be covered by general
social behavior training anyway.  One complication is that children are 
spending most of their lives learning how to live and behave in the current
culture; to thrust them into the current middle ages and expect them to know
what to do and say is a bit much.  But staying out of fire pits and away 
from others' stuff (etc.) is basic.

True.  Again, while parents should not be afraid to bring their kids when
possible and appropriate, neither should they be afraid to leave them home
when its not.

Why not *on-site* babysitting?  Sometimes this isn't possible, but often
it is (and a good way for the older kids to make money too).  I believe
our Barony's last Twelfth Night celebration provided on-site baby-sitting;
I hope they'll have it next year too.

Subject:  Combat Archery --> --> --> 

I was one of the (fighting) participants in the combat archery demo/trial,
and let me tell anyone who hasn't tried it - it it **FUN**!!!  It is of
my opinion that we need something like this in the EAST.

We used a mixture of many rules from several kingdoms that have combat archery
and as a fighter I have no problems in safety.  I do believe however that
the combat archers should wear something to more accurately designate them
- such as a specially colored helm - as it was sometimes difficult to tell
them from fighters in closely packed situations.

The amount of tactics involved (compared to two line of fighters crashing 
together and trying to flank each other) is amazing.  The strategy that
seemed to work best was:

  Designate at least one shield and a harrying weapon to protect each archer.
  Send a fast flanking unit (just a couple of fast fairly proficient people)
    into the backfield to kill or keep busy their archers.
  Attack the opposing shield wall with a mostly defensive shiled wall or walls
   with the rest of your force and let the archers get in range and kill
   as many of the other side as necessary.
  Mop up!

I'm sure that are many other effective tatics as well. This is definitely 
a game that lends itself to those who can think on their feet.  I think 
the emergence of this as a fighting form in this kingdom could greatly
improve the way we fight and think on the field.

So let's get this started! Anyone interested?

Subject: The Letter of Dance

Listening to the plea for dances, and dance music, from Gwdiawen, I am put
back in mind of something I've been thinking a lot about for the past two
weeks. It seems to me that there are an awful lot of dance masters and
mistresses out there who are in need of more dances, and that there is *very*
little communication about style, even when the steps of dances are well
known. I ran into several dance mistresses at Pennsic who were their groups'
A&S officers, and thus default dance mistresses, who were desperately soaking
up any and all dances they could get at the War. It seems to me that better
communication would be a fine thing.

So, how about a newsletter? As far as I can find, the only inter-kingdom dance
newsletter that's ever gotten off the ground was the one that Carolingia tried
to run a few years ago, which folded when the editor moved out of state. I'm
willing to try to start it up again, *if* I can get some interest. I will not
write all of the articles myself; that would be folly, and would simply give
those dances that we do. For this thing to work, I need both subscribers and
contributors. The letter could be used to distribute reconstructions, dance
music, and source information. So, all you dance enthusiasts out there, would
you be interested in such a thing? Do you have any suggestions about how it
should work, or what should go into it? Talk to me.

To simulate archery in a medieval field battle, you would need massed targets 
to shoot at at a distance of at the *very* least 50 yards.  I was happy to
see distance target at the war point.  If i had been able to see it from the

Our Pied Piper will be very interested in the discussion going on here -
I'll pass a copy to her.

One rule that I think should be added to near or at the top of the list
of things to teach little folk is the word "HOLD" and what it means.
When my un-SCA niece and nephew (aged 4 and 3) visited me at an event,
the first things I explained to them were what to do when they heard the
word "Hold" and what the rope around the field meant (eric). I was pleased
to see that when "Hold" was cried on the field, they both froze at what
they were doing until I told them to continue.

I don't believe in leaving children at home during events - not only is
the SCA is richer for the families that attend, but children are very
period. :-)  I like to see Daddies dancing with their daughters and I like
to see Moms teaching their sons to bow to the passing pointy hats.

A bit of information: last week, the East Kingdom created a new lesser
office of state, Chancellor Minor, responsible for advising parents
and autocrats on the integration of children into the SCA.  The
probable first holder of this office is sister to the lady who has run
the East Kingdom Tyger School for Pages at Pennsic War for several
years.  The office will be collecting & disseminating ideas and plans
for children's activities at events.  Great care was given to ensure
that the office would not turn out either to be a baby-sitting service
or to interfere with parents raising their children.

Message-Id: <1243@inuxd.UUCP>

I too have have a few war stories but the fun ones are those getting to
the war.  I'm not sure they count so I won't relate them.
What I will relate is a 'thank you' story/message.

I arrived late Sunday night, some how set up camp and the next morning
began my second Pennsic adventure.  Tuesday morning, however, I awoke
with a burning throat that I suspected came from the colder morning.
Well I took throat lozenges and dressed alittle warmer.  By the end
of the day my throat was on fire, my voice was all but gone, I was
very week, and I had chills from a fever.  With a friend from my camp
site to help, I made my way to the Chirurgon's tent.

Once there I asked if I could have my tempeture taken to see how hi the
fever was.  The persons there at once agreed and moved into action.
Within minutes (it seemed) my tempeture was taken, as well as pause and
resperation. They asked about my medical history, what I had eaten that
day and personal history.  I indeed had a fever of a 101 degrees, and
everything else was pointing to a virous (bad summer cold).  Therefore
the chirurgons, attending me, said I should eat well, drink plenty of 
fluids and take asperin.  But I can not take asperin or any other asperin
type medicine.  These very patien chirurgons continued though various 
forms of remedies untill they found one my system could handle.

Thanks to them, I was able to stay at Pennsic a few more days (the weather
made it impossible for my cold to get much better).
So to all the Chirurgons at Pennsic I wish to extend a heart felt 
THANK YOU.

Hi Malice,

        I had a good time too:  This was a better war to be a musician than to
be a dancer.  The first couple of nights, playing with the musicians was a
wonderful high.  (I'm not sure how well our local consort could handle requests
-- as opposed to prepared sets -- because we have no exceptionally skilled
musicians.  But I'm motivated to try it and see.)

        I agree with you that next war should see more-active and
better-prepared dance-mastering.  In particular, it would be nice to get
different groups' *different* dances instead of concentrating on the few that
*everyone* does.  I'd also like to see dance time split next year with some
preallocated to teaching and some to just dancing -- and with some of the
former explicitly allocated to advanced teaching.  (It doesn't take any longer
to teach experienced dancers Geloxia than it does to teach beginners
Sellenger's Round.)

        As for doing it to live music, I can see doing as much as possible to
live music, but I'd still like to allow tapes for what's left.  Unless you can
think of a practical way to prepare a consort with a repertoire of over fifty
dances?

There's good story behind this one...

The first groups to camp up on the Mountain were the King of Ansteorra
and Master Ferall von Halsstern & party, including reserved space for
the Crown Prince & Princess of the East.  This initially exhalted
population, along with the general annoyance of the people invlolved
BEFORE they were found land to camp on, led to the Mountains first
name: Peers without Tears, or, eventually, No More Tears Hill.  This
was generally considered a BAD NAME.  Assorted other names were
suggested: Peerage Estates, Nob Hill, Mount St. Hell-and-gone, The New
World, Hy Brasil,...  

On Wednesday afternoon, I was making the rounds of the royal
encampments in order to start arangements for Great Court.  Needless
to say, Ansteorran camp was the LAST one I got to, for all the obvious
reasons.  Eventually, I found a friendly chirurgeon & got a go-cart
lift up the Hill, and discovered that the King of Ansteorra is a very
pleasant man, at his first Pennsic, with a good sense of humor.  He
was the first to offer to me the name Mount St Hell-and-gone.  He told
me that he had no particular business in Court, but would like to
stand up to say "Hello!  I'm having a great time!" or some such, and
asked my opinion on what might be good things to say.  I told him that
"Hello! I'm having a great time!" would be just fine, but that he
might want to make a cute cut about being forced to camp on the other
side of nowhere.  He said this was no problem: the Hill was, he said,
a wonderful place to camp, and had a great view to boot.  Well, said I
(and here comes the good part!), this hill doesn't have an official
name, and whatever name you give it in Court is bound to be the
official one.  He obviously took the idea much to heart, because in
Great Court, his only piece of business was to bestow the name "Mount
Aislinn, Heaven's Gate".

For further thoughts on great court, see a later posting....

Ciao.

Greetings to all!

For all you court mavins out there, a bit of news on court at Pennsic.

There were 11 Royal Couples at Pennsic War this year.  The King of the
West was conspicuously absent, for good reasons, I understand.  Also
present were the Prince and Princess of Drachenwald, and the Royal
heirs of the East, Middle, Atlantia, and Calontir.  Most of the
royalty held court for Their Kingdom some time during the week.
The Queen of Trimaris was forced to leave the War early due to an
injury, so there were 21 crowned heads on the dais for Great Court
Saturday night.  Court was prefaced by a performance by the Pennsic
Chorus, composed of gentles from around the Knowne World.  Their
Majesties and Their entourages processed into court in a torch-lit
procession.  The King of the Outlands made the first & greatest splash
by entering with drummers and belly-dancers, His Queen borne in on a
palanquin.  They spent Court reclining on a couch, and being fanned by
an attendant with a 5 foot fan.  After that, anything would be
anti-climactic.
  Court lasted 3 hours, of which 1 hour was used by the Midrealm
(grumble).  I can't begin to list all the business done in Courts, but
for all you Easterners out there, Gavin and Sedalia made 5 peers
during the course of the War: 

Griffin du Fort Epee, Knight
Lucan von Drachenklaue, Master of Arms
William of the Black Fletch, Master of the Pelican
Morgan Silverlock, Mistress of the Laurel
Elron Shadowmaker, Master of the Laurel
Duke Morgan Sheridan, Knight

In my opinion, the greatest new addition to court this year were a
full set of banners of the arms of the 12 Kingdoms, made by a group of
seamstresses from Gwyntarian (alas, I have no list of names!),
supervised by Mistress Graidhne ni Ruadh.  These banners are 12 feet
long, 45 inches wide, with the arms 45 inches tall.  They are
gorgeous, and provided a splendid backdrop to Court.  


Enough for now.  Good cheer!

Felicitatious greetings;

My brother who lives in the East has told me some of his wild tales from
the war, and I want to check to see if he was as notorious as he claims
to have been.  If I am to believe his version of the stories, the entire
Middle is cowering in terror and may never recover. :^)

Just to see if I can confirm any of his stories, do any of the Pennsic 
participants recall seeing a short stocky fighter with a target shield, 
and with a horse tail on his helm?  (I don't imagine horse tails were
*too* common)  He claims to have been generally seen charging large 
numbers of people, breaking through shield walls singlehandedly,
et cetera, et cetera.  Well, he admits that a friend helped a little.
The friend mundanely plays tackle for a college, and is considered as
being a good person to have in your ranks.

I personally think that the Venus Fly Trap stories are *much* more
entertaining and believable. :^)

One note: In Sunset Shire for many years, there was a children's
tourney at their annual event. I have been out of touch with them for a
few years, but attended two such tourneys. Because the children were
the focus of several things going on there, there were no perceivable
problems with children. 

The people who showed up like kids. Most of them were parents.
The rest liked the kids as persons there.

Events included pin the tail on the dragon, apple bobbing and something
strange with pumpkins (I forget what it was - they were in a pumpkin
farming area and there were often surpluses). The kids were very busy.
The grownups had fun playing go and cheering the kids on.

I recommend it for every largish event.

Ah, the desire to hear war stories--particularly current ones!  For those
of us who couldn't go, how can we ever get our fill?  Certainly not through
the wondrous, yet time limited for those who hate copious typing, confines
of this net, Rialto, marketplace, gossip fence, etcetera.  I take great
pleasure from reading the stories of far away people which I might not
otherwise be privileged to hear (the venus flytraps are wonderful!).  However,
how about some local get togethers  prior to the next event to exchange the
stories while they are fresh??For those who wentt, here is your chance for
a captive audiencee and to hear the ones you might have missed!

To Carolingians in particular--I will happily volunteer Windsmeet for the site
andd will post a time if I get enough interested responses.  If you're
interested, I can be mailed to at KGANDEK%MITVMC.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU  And
spread the word.I had eagerly expected to go until the weekend before, so it's
not possible that I could hear too many stories..(whoops, will I regret that??)

Subject:      Music for dancing

Dani -
  Disclaimer: since Myrkfaelinn holds its arts meetings and thus dance
practices on the same night that I sing, I haven't been to a dance
practice here in 3-4 years.
  That said, I got into the SCA for the dancing.  I have always been
disappointed that different places in SCA know different dances and
there is not much overlap between them.  We all have some, but not much,
of Arbeau (sp?) in common, and from time to time people have collected
a few dances and music in books, but these have not been distributed
or even accepted widely.
  Myrkfaelinn has held dances exclusively to live music for the last
4-5 years.  We have music for about 15 dances; that's it.  I'd love
to do Strip the Willow, for example, but don't have steps or music
and don't know where to get them.  I don't get out much, so you might
say I don't know music/dances because I don't come in contact with the
people who do; however, the head of the Music Guild who DOES go to a
lot of events all over the place hasn't brought back anything either.
  WHAT CAN WE DO?
  I'll play ANYTHING; send me copies of dance music and steps and our
local recorder group will learn them and teach the dances at arts
meetings.  Come to Myrkie events and we'll do these dances.  Mention
your favorite dance(s) when you make your reservation and we'll work
on them at practices and do them at the event.  Send me tapes and I'll
work on transcribing them (this will take a while).  Send me addresses
for buying tapes and I'll buy them (Myrkfaelinn currently has no tapes
at all, I believe).
  I would not advocate an SCA standard dance book; people have their
own favorite arrangements of things, and as long as they're playable
and danceable, I don't care how they're arranged.  If you photocopy
your 20 pages for me, I'll photocopy my 15 for you.  What we need to
do is wave wildly and yell and scream if we have something we're
willing to send someone so people can tell where to get these wonderful
dances that we're missing.
  Other suggestions?                 - Gwdiauwen

Subject: The *Other* SCAnet?

Hi again! Things have gotten a bit quiet during Pennsic; I'm sure that this
will all change, now that everyone is back. I've got a couple of notes worth
of observations from the War, so here goes.

I'm sure lots of people noticed all of the signs around the Pennsic bulletin
boards for SCAnet. What's curious is, it isn't our SCAnet they were talking
about. Apparently, there has been an entirely separate SCAnet forming over
on FIDOnet. I never managed to get in touch with Simon of the Beautiful
Waters, who appears to be the prime instigator of the other SCAnet, while I
was at the War. Does anyone know him? (His address appears to be Alexandria,
VA) If I can find no other way to get in touch, I'll call up his FIDO board,
but I'm kind of unclear about what's involved there.

Out of curiosity, does anyone know anything about this other SCAnet? I had
no inkling that it existed until Pennsic, but it appears to be pretty decent
sized. I'm hearing more and more about various SCA boards, and I'm really
beginning to wonder just how many there are. Are there SCA discussions
going on on any of the commercial systems (Compuserve and its ilk)? I had
thought that this discussion was rather unique; now, I'm beginning to 
suspect that that is far from the case...

This is a very good summary of the problems caused archery by the battles on
the same site.  Hopefully the lessons learned this year will not be forgotten
and will be become the base for next year's War.

I was very impressed by the musicians at Pennsic XVII.  It is very hard to
play for dancers; I once presided over a disaster where we tried to use a
professional (i.e., Indiana University School of Music grad students) band
for a revel.  For practice, however, live music is just punishment for the
musicians; even a nice piece of music turns into torture on the 20th replay.
Finally, it is unreasonable to expect musicians to play on sight some of the
pieces used for more complex dances.

I would use tape recorders for practice, and live musicians for the social
dances in the evenings, unless the dance masters involved in the practices
had already arranged the repertory with the musicians.

Subject: notes & anecdotes

Okay, it's time for some trading of stories from Pennsic Prairie (my 
Unofficial-but-Rather-Appropriate name for Pennsic 17).  It's amazing how many 
interesting things can occur in one week, if you just get 5400 of your closest 
friends together. Here are some of my random memories:

The Exorcist -- during the Masked Ball, there was a Tuchux exorcism ceremony
held right outside, to drive the demons from Lord Li Kung Lo's best tunic...

The Shrine of St. Michael of Bedford -- anyone who was there want to tell
how this came about?

Heat -- the primary characteristic of this War (as well as everywhere else
in the US this month). Still and all, we did get the Annual Act of God right
on schedule on Thursday night, as well as some really pretty pyrotechnics on
Wednesday (the one redeeming feature of the Hill was the awesome view...)

The Pennsic Chorus -- find whoever was responsible for this, and make them a
Pelican! In one short week, they managed to pull together an absolutely
*beautiful* performance, to open War Court. Did anyone tape the performance?

The Unforgiving Minutes -- the prequel to Murder At the War is out! Of course,
Maiden Mongolia apparently sold out in a matter of hours. Has anyone read it
yet?

There We Were, The End -- speaking of books, the conclusion of Yosef Alaric's
histories of the future Pennsic Wars has drawn to a close, with this, the
story of the *very* last Pennsic War. Fun SF, and good satire. 

The Hill -- given that this Pennsic was the largest ever (by a pretty healthy
margin), it is no surprise that there was some crowding. To alleviate this, a
number of encampments, including Their Highnesses of the East, the Dominion of
Myrkfaelinn, and Enchanted Ground, were put up at the top of the hill *way*
past the battlefield. The Hill developed several names over the course of the
week. The most popular seems to have been Mt. St. Hell-and-Gone, although there
was a movement for Cariadoc Hill, since so many people were trekking up there
to attend His Grace's classes. At War Court, amidst much acclaim, the Hill was
officially named Mount Aislinn (please pardon if the spelling's wrong), after
the much-beloved late Queen.

Well, that's a starting sample. Other memories/stories/anecdotes?

In a recent Midrealm Crown Tourney a member (male) of our order was paired up
with Emmylene Carithil in a bout. He fell victim to this sterotype and had
his head handed to him on a platter.  Emmylene finally was knocked out of
the tourney in the fourth round (two victories, two losses) which is more
than respectable.

In Saviolo's text on rapier fighting (c 1590) he discussed the nobility of
women in battle (a good subject politically in Elizabethan England).  He
recounts that his mother once rescued him and a friend when they were set
upon by about seven adversaries outside his home; his mother emerged,
halberd in hand, and dispatched four of the assailants before the rest
fled.  Your respect for this feat would be greater if you'd ever picked
up a real halberd ("weapon of weight", Silver calls it).

	As I was unfortunate enough to have been unable to attend Pennsic,
I would ask for accounts of the war from all who attended.  All that I 
currently know is that the Middle Kingdom won, which is good as my king
was fighting for them.  I have dedicated my dragonbank to the collections

Subject: better off dead?

in reply to the arguments of Dani of the 7 wells:

I, too, played with the instrumentalists at pensic.  Unlike M. Dani, I only 
played two nights because the dancing didn't start until after 10:30, by which 
time i was tired, not to mention not feeling like hanging around the barn in 
the dark with nothing to do waiting for whatever scheduled event was to end.

I loved it.  What I learned from the experience was that all you need for an 
dance band is one good musician with a loud instrument, one drummer with a 
sense of rythm and some knowledge of the dances, and ANY NUMBER of eager 
players of mediocre level can fill in the rest.  It makes a brave noise in a 
large hall.

As far as i can tell, the problem with the pensic dancing was neither to much 
live music nor too few live musician, but too few dance masters.

The consort is there to play music, period.  

THe dance mistress's job is to:
1) select the dances, basing her choice on the mood of the dancers, their 
ability, and the music available.
2) comunicat those choices to the dancers and tell them to form up sets.  
teach if nessesary.
3) see when the dancers are ready, and tell the consort to start.
4) give the consort the beat and tempo.
5) if the dance is one of variable length (bransle, pavan, galiard)  judge 
when the dance should stop and tell the consort to stop.  the consort is too 
busy keeping their place in the music to watch the dancing, let alone make 
desisions about it.


What is nessesary for fun dancing at the next war is:
1) for the dance mistresses to devide the nights of the war among them so each 
has some time to run things her way.  It may be nessesary to write to some of 
them by (gasp)  U.S. mail instead of asking for voluteers on the net.
2) for the dance mistresses to disseminate the music they want played to the 
musicians who plan to attend.  We *do* have a kingdom music guild, it must be 
good for something.  alternitively, the dance mistresses could bring their 
own consorts with them.
3) some dance mistress to put her foot down and not let some other one person 
run absolutely everything every night of the war.

MORE COMMENTS FROM PENNSIC...

	I had the opportunity to watch part of a combat archery demo
while at the war.I found i t very interesting because I'd never seen this aspect
before.They had some archers and some heavy fighters and showed different 
combinations.The first had the field divided into archers on one side 
and hf's on the other with a shield wall arrangement. The result was that the archers got creamed. The second arrangement ,however divided  them equally and the result was a much higher energy battle.It was amazing how fast a hf can move 
with archers on the field.
	Noone got hurt,and  I think it definitely improved the battle 
(at least from this spectator's view). Ihope the East does some more experimenting with combat archery.

On another topic..
It was nice to meet some of you at the war.I'm soirry I missed the various 
get togethers for the net people (or whatever we are called these days-
actually how-about 'fishermen''?-(because we use the nets) anyway ,
with the heat, the ice cold showers, the dust, and the very long 
walk to my campsite (as some of you know who managed to find it),I
fell asleep early most nights.
	The previous paragraph sounds awful, I really had a great time,
there weren't bugs,hurricanes,or floods,and I only saw a few snakes!
How about some more war stories? Anyone going to recount the TWOCHUCKS(sp)
excorcism of the chiergeon (sp) 's tunic? ??

I saw HRM Brion Thornbird on the field at the field battle, and he seemed to be
doing well.  I know him somewhat, as he used to be from Caer Anterth Mawr 
(Milwaukee, WI), and was squire to Duke Sir Corin, who is the Baronial Herald.
Poobah, Brion!  Another local boy done good.  Also, it seemed as if half of 
Caer Anterth was camped in Caid camp.

Greetings to all!

I like Master Kobiyashi's suggestion that we name the net "The
Rialto".  He has a good point: most of the names suggested (House
Ethereal, House of the Net) sound very SCA, but aren't really medieval
concepts.  After all, we aren't a household, we are a bunch of people
who get together to talk over issues of interest.  Given that view, a
couple other ideas come to mind.  Two places where pople of the Middle
Ages could come together to meet and talk were the great fairs
(Champagne, for example), and the great universities.  

Interesting?

This is a War story, one of many, I hope.

So, no shit, there was my unit, not long after the start of the Woods
Battle, having been ordered to fight a delaying action on the steepest
part of the main causeway in the Woods.  We were with the defenders
(Eastrealm) and comprised about a dozen people from the Debateable
Lands (Pittsburgh) and the House of the Drunken Badger (Morgantown,
W.Va.).  A larger attacking force was expected to come marching up the
causeway and the commanders wanted them slowed down a bit, so they
ordered up about a ton of hamburger (us) and asked our unit commander,
Lord Magnus de Cnoc an Iora, to place us somewhere along the steep part
of the causeway.  Magnus chose the steepest, narrowest part, and had us
laying low in the woods until the approach of the attackers could be plainly 
heard, advancing along the road below.  He then had us run out on the
causeway, having instucted us to place our shields (about 6 of us) in two 
ranks across the road, and our long weapons (another 6) up on the bank on 
each side.  This was done in the space of only a few seconds.

The approaching force was about 25 people, and they were maybe 75 feet
away when we deployed.  The effective distance was somewhat farther
than that, because they were marching uphill.  They paused briefly to
assess the situation, during which time the three of us in the front
rank of shields all looked at each other and realized THAT ALL THREE OF
US WERE WOMEN FIGHTERS!!

Now we women fighters in the Debateable Lands and its close environs
have gotten a little disgusted with those special appellations for women
fighters which have been proposed, such as "Flowers of Chivalry", and so
we call ourselves collectively "The Venus Flytraps From Hell".  Finding
ourselves thus arrayed in the very forefront of the impending fray, we
raised our cheer ("Fishnet stockings!") and braced our line as the
Midrealmers began to run up the hill.  Just as they came within
weapon-reach of us, one of them began to shout "Spears on the sides!
Spears on the hill!", which did have the effect of ensuring that none
of them ran over us.  We put ourselves on full defensive so that the
rest of our unit could do the killing.  

Thus were the attackers, in fact, digested to a man while we lost only a
couple of spear people.  

I think this goes to show that training and discipline count for an
awful lot, especially in that kind of tactical situation.  It is
wonderful to be able to fight alongside people that you KNOW are not
going to leave you unprotected for the sake of trying to grab some
personal glory.  Of course, it also goes to show that women can anchor
a shield wall, but then we all knew that already, yes? ;-)  And none of
us weighs 200 pounds, either.

Next year perhaps we can make ourselves matching Flytrap baldrics and
wear queen-size fishnet stockings over our leg armor.  Maybe even submit 
a badge to the heralds (how about "Argent, on a fret sable, a Venus
flytrap enflamed"?)  Have T-shirts printed up that say "First, lure;
then, grab; THEN digest!" and watch people go nuts trying to figure
them out . . . the possibilities are endless.

Subject: Pennsic Postmortem -- Archery

This was *not* a good Pennsic for archery.  To a large extent this is because
some bad decisions were made -- and it is notable that the people who made
those decisions were *not* the ones who burnt themselves out spending their
entire war on the archery range trying to make them work.

Many people deplored last year's location, a good half mile from the main road.
 This year the range was located right next to the road.  So, unfortunately,
was the battlefield.  This meant both having to stop archery -- or even
partially tear down the range -- for battles and a greatly heightened danger of
people straying too close to the line of fire.  (This latter was exacerbated by
the presence of a large campsite beyond the field.)  On balance, the old
location was far better.


The controversial moving target turned out not to have any of the *technical*
problems people expected.  It didn't tip, it didn't eat arrows, it was safe and
easy to pull.  If the carts are still around next year they could be set up on
the clout range as an interesting and enjoyable novelty shoot.  As a war point,
however, the moving target turned out to be a logistical nightmare and a bad
idea:

--It took too long to run people through, so an extra day had to be allocated
to the archery war point.  (This was not as bad as it might have been, because
relatively few people shot the archery point.)

--The old war point used the targets at 20, 30 and 40 yards which are used for
most of the other shooting during the week, so there were many opportunities
for practice.  The moving target required special practice sessions; most of
the people shooting the point got little or no practice.

--I was present at the last two rounds of the moving-target war point.  On the
second last the Midrealm was shooting and an Easterner was pulling.  The
Easterner pulled the target in 15 seconds.  The last round had Easterners
shooting and a Midrealmer pulling the target.  It was clocked at 28 seconds.
The East won that point.  I doubt that those rounds were typical, but it's
clear that in this shoot the effect of a good target-puller quite swamps
differences in accuracy, and the archery point *should* be a test of archery
skill.


The 75-yard clout was a nice distance, easy enough to encourage poorer archers
but not trivial.  (One of the novel shoots involved hitting a watermellon
perched on that target; it took about 1500 arrows!)  More points could have
been earned by hitting the silhouette at 150 yards, but few tried since a) it
was placed in a depression where it couldn't be seen and b) it was far too hard
a target for the bonus.  If it had been worth 20 points to hit it, it might
still have been a poor bargain -- but far more people would have tried.


The archery points continue to be the points that can go to the side willing to
bestir itself.  This year they were shot by approximately 350 archers on a
side.  The Midrealm won the 75-yard clout shoot by approximately (I don't
remember the exact numbers) 700 points to 600.  (A point is one arrow in the
target, so the average archer got about two hits out of six arrows -- about
twice the score that was gotten last year with a 100-yard target.)  The East
won the moving-target shoot by about 200 points to 150.  Either side could have
won the other point by getting another hundred people to carry their bows to
the archery range for half an hour.


A final comment:  This year's logistical difficulties meant a lot of
postponements and schedule changes, and the various means of learning of them
were inconsistent with each other.  Many people missed shoots by coming too
early or too late.  Last year's policy of keeping an up-to-date official master
schedule at the archery range should be revived.

Subject: Pennsic Postmortem -- Dancing

Is live music better than tapes for SCA dancing?  Before this war I'd have
answered in the affirmative.  Having undergone a week of it, I'll modify that:
It makes a nice change of pace but it doesn't work as a steady diet.  To be
sure, given good enough live music there would be no need for tapes, but we
don't have that.

I'm a dance master and I played with the musicians at the war for four of the
nights, so I got a good view of the proceedings.  There were some good
musicians playing -- one in particular -- but they DIDN'T KNOW THAT MANY
DANCES.  To make matters more interesting, the one-in-particular (more on that
later) who was essentially running the show was not a dancer and didn't know
when to STOP.  (In a couple of cases we even stopped in the middle of a dance.)

The results?  For one thing, the same small number (say a dozen) of dances got
played over and over and over all week.  And to fill out the time, they were
*long*.  One friend told me of her surprise when she left for the bathroom at
the beginning of "Hole in the Wall" -- and found it still going when she
returned.  Some dances only want to be danced once through.  Others should be
danced several times through -- but not more than a dozen or two!

The first couple of nights having live music was very nice indeed.  But having
it all week meant that people were not able to learn new dances to take home to
their groups.  (The more so since most of the dances that got played were the
"common denominator" dances such as "Hole in the Wall", "Belle Qui",
"Korobushka", "Strip the Willow", etc.)  It also meant boredom towards the end.

The last [Sunday] night some people brought a tape recorder and tape.  I was
rather looking forward to the opportunity to do diffeent dances.  But before
anything could get started our one-man-band arrived and told us that of
*course* we were going to dance to live music.  I regret that I didn't argue
the point, but it's hard to argue electronics over acoustical instruments in a
Scadian context.  I did ask that we do some dances that we hadn't been doing
all week -- not exotics, even, but dances such as Hyde Park, Heartsease,
Nonesuch -- but they weren't in his book of dance music.  Sigh.

So what am I saying?  That I didn't care for the dancing at the War?  Not
really.  I'm saying that the best results can be achieved with a *combination*
of live and taped music.  Our local consort can provide music on demand for one
or two sets of music -- including most of those being done at the war -- but
isn't up to doing a good job for an evening.  I assume this is true for most of
the consorts out there.  If we were to insist on providing all the music, none
of the more [musically] challenging dances would get danced.  On the other
hand, people *appreciate* the live music.  In reasonable quantities.

WARNING  OPEN FLAMES

o.k. so we live in a litiginous society, where socety=U.S.A. 1988.

if something realy bad happens, we are pasive-form-of-verb-unprintable.

in the mean time we can spend all our efforts in a futile attempt to 
completely cover our posteriors, or we can boldly and valorously do that which 
is right and which most encourages individuals to do that which is right.

the following represents my personal views only and does not in anyway 
represent the views/philosophy/actions of the SCA in general or anyone but me 
in particular

an authorized fighter or fencer is expected to know what the armor standards 
are--that's part of being authorized. an Authorized fighter/fenser (af/f) is 
assumed to be a responsible individual and to understand, consent to, and 
comply with the SCA rules of the list and armor standards.
A martial is a resourse. it is a marshal's responsibility to know not only 
what the armor standards are, but have a good idea of what does and does not 
meet those standards. It is a marshal's responsiblity to make this knowledge
availabe to fighters.  A martial doing armor inspection should check that the 
weapons are legal and unlikely to break. He (she, it, herinafter refered to as 
he) should look for signs of wear in the armor that the fighter may have 
overlooked (straps giving way, metal or wire mesh stressed) and maybe ask 
about a few things the af/f might have forgotten (cup, brunhildas) and look at 
the places like the neck that the af/f can't easily check himself.  if a 
piece/set of armor or a weapon has never been inspected befor, it is the 
af/f's responsiblitly to tell the martial so and to explain the materials used 
and how they conform to standard.  if an af/f is unsure if any part of his
armor is up to standard he should ask a martial befor he fights in it. In fact,
the af/f should consult with a martial or reputable armoror while assembling
 the armor or weapon so that no embaresment occurs.  
If an af/f goes onto the field with substandard armor it is because he has 
failed to use the resourse provided for him by the martialate and it is his 
own ____ fault and noone elses.  The marshal cannot know if the af/f has lined 
his fensing jacket with cheezecloth instead of canvass, he cannot know that 
the af/f has glued the grill onto his helm with Elmers@ glue and then painted 
it silver to look like solder.
If an af/f goes onto the field with a dangerous and illegal weapon having 
assured assured with words or implied by silence that it is standard, legal, 
and safe, it is because he is a nitterling; the responsibilty and the shame 
are his own.

it is nessesary to have rules defining the minimum of safe equipment.  it is 
sufficient to say that equipment shall be x "or the equivalent"  The fighters 
and marcialate then create and disseminate a body of knowledge conserning what 
is equivalent to x which is expanded and refined over time.  it is impossilbe 
to create an exhaustive list of things equivalent to x and the armor standards 
are an inapropriate place to attempt to make one.  A well edited, well 
presented, well thaught-out commentary on what has and has not proven save 
would be an extremely usefull thing for any marshall to have.  A set of armors 
standards that cannot easily be understood and commited to memory by an 
avarage af/f is not only not usefull, it is detrimental to the art it purports 
to serve.

the preceding philosophy is worthless if we get sued.  i believe, however, 
that it is consistant and workable and in keeping with the ideals of our 
society (soc.=SCA)  To place any responsibility for the af/f's well-armoring 
on the mashal is to by implication place all of it.  This  is an unwarented 
and intolorable burden.

	Very well...

	Yes.  It is reasuring that names are in some way distinct.  With
the way we tend to move around calling yourself John of Foobar just isn't 
enough today, though in period it would most likely have been.

	Could you explain what you mean here?  What would be some "levels
of protection"?

	I would think that it would be given the same protection as any other,
with perhaps one exception: a member of a household might want to note the
association in his or her name, and should be allowed to, provided that 
he or she really *is* a member of the household.


>What about an order name?  

	Can you explain how these might warrent more or less protection?  THat
would help us to form an opinion.

	Same.

 
>If we register names, should we require a minimum level of authenticity?  

	Definately.


>What do you think that level should be?  

	Somewhat less stringent than I understand it to be now.  I think that
if someone has done the work researching a language and time to the point that
a competent arguement can be (and has been) made for a name, then it should be
allowed.

	An example:  my name as it is should pass, Kwellend is Old English,
Njal and Kollskeggsson are both well documented Norse names.  It seems
reasonable to me, given the state of affairs that existed in parts of 
England in the 10th and 11th century, that the construction Kwellend-Njal
could have occured (Or indeed most English adjective-Norse name combinations).
From the period approx. 800AD on there was substantial interaction between
the two languages in the region of Northumbria and East Anglia, and the idea
of a Norseman picking up an English kenning does seem reasonable.  But under
the current rules of submission this would not pass, mixing the two languages 
in one construction is not legal, while submitting them as two separate words
in one name should pass.  Basically almost any attempt make names more period
in the use of original languages should be encouraged, as this adds signifi-
cantly to the atmosphere of the society.

	Yes, because there are more people to do the research, and these 
are the names people are more likely to see, (moreso than an individual's
name) and so should exibit a higher standard of authenticity.

On the subject of "what to call this thingy that you are reading now", why
not use some "real" place that has no counterpart in the SCA.  My suggestion
is "the Rialto", but "the market" or "the wharfs" (wharves?) would do just
as well.  We could even use "the Moon", though that would raise eyebrows
both mundanely and in persona.

8 p;us years.  This message comes to you from the Kingdom of Caid, Barony
of Altavia.  I, unfortunately, will not be able to make Pensic.  Our King, 
however, will be there fighting for the Middle Kingdom (?).  I will be 
waiting to hear from all of you who make it.  Please!! tell me what happens.

   I am also interested in any thing to do with leather working.  I have
been working in leather for over 20 years and am a member of the kingdom 
leather workers guild.  We are always looking for new ideas and technics.
If you have anything new or unique, I personaly would be interested in hearing
from you.  I would also would be glad to answer any questions that I can.

How about "Roll of Ethereal Domains?"

That way you get both puns.

Since, I'm a Pensic Merchant I received a list of the merchants who

both appeared on that list.  I also remember that there were a few
larger merchant/Inn sites on my map, but I can't say if those sites
were for taverns or not.

Other names that come to mind include "Ethereal Epistles" since we are
mostly writing letters over the ether (In fact, mine go over an Ether-net!),
and "Ether Mail" for those of us who will keep calling it e-mail regardless.
The confessional names are actually half serious. I sometimes use this
medium to unburden my soul, as do many other folk.

I could see some problems with drawing this up as House Anything
because it could cause some confusion with other existing households.
Someone (my apologies, I forget who) suggested a variation on a theme
of "Roll of Far Domains."  I think this has a lot of potential, and
the "domain" pun may make up for losing the "etherial" pun :-)

On the more general question of what to call the net, I must admit to
shying away from Crystal Books and such.  This is a personal preference;
I'm not bothered by other folks' attempts at euphamism.  I just see
few euphamisms for jarringly modern anachronisms that aren't at least
a little jarring themselves.  I figure that I'm simply corresponding 
with a lot of other gentles, and correspondence through computer 
networks requires no more of a nickname than correspondence through 
modern postal services.

What was probably my most miserable SCA event involved 3.5 hours of two
small children screaming and throwing things.  Their mother was present
-- she figured that if they didn't bother her, they shouldn't bother
anybody.

That said, there is no reason for children to cause problems at events
if everybody takes a few simple precautions:


Rules for parents:

 * Your children are *YOUR* responsibility.  Not the Society's.  Not the
Autocrat's.  Not the host's.  **YOURS**.  It is amazing how many parents
simply dump off children and expect "somebody" to keep an eye on them.

 * Most parents seem to have an agreement where everybody tries to keep
an eye on everybody's kids.  If you do this, make sure that the people
that you think are watching your kids really are.  You don't need an
accident followed by "But I thought *you* were watching him ...".

 * Try to get the kids into the spirit of the event, and if at all
possible, get them involved.  Kids *love* to help out with adult
activities.  Note, however, that kids are experts at telling the
difference between real help and busy work.

 * In any case, provide something for them to do.  Most of the
childish nastiness I have seen is a result of pure and simple boredom.

 * As soon as the children are old enough to walk, they must start
learning rules.  For example:
	* Stay away from fire pits.
	* Stay out of the Lists (unless carrying list cards for the
          heralds -- something kids love to do)
	* Hands off other peoples' stuff.  Especially feast gear.
	* No running through camps or between tables
Teaching them the rules, again, is YOUR responsibility.

 * Many SCA activities simply cannot tolerate ill behaved children.
Court is a prime example.  (I've been at courts where *I* wanted to
scream from boredom .... :-) If your children are misbehaving and
messing things up for other people, it is your responsibility to take
them outside and calm them down.

 * If you know in advance that the event is going to be a total washout
for children, leave them with a babysitter.  (The event I mentioned
above was a Barony meeting -- possibly the dullest thing possible for
kids.)


Rules for autocrats:

 * Insist that parents keep their children under control.

 * If you expect large numbers of children who might cause trouble at
the site (Coronations and Twelfth Nights especially) consider having off
site baby sitting.


Rules for others:

 * Remember that there are children present and take steps to minimize
problems.  Some hints:
	* At feasts, make sure your tablecloth doesn't trail on the
	  floor.
	* Keep utensils & goblets away from the edge of the table
	* When you stack things, make sure the piles are not too wobbly.
	* Try to keep the more tempting "toys" out of sight when you're
	  not around.  Knives are a special temptation.

The key words for everybody are USE YOUR HEAD and DON'T BE STUPID.

	William. Lords, Ladies, & Gentles,
	Please feel free to make whatever use you wish of my postings
to the sca mailing list-alt.sca-whatever it might become.  Should I
be so fortunate as to utter something profound enough to merit 
passing on, please do so!  The idea behind the network is to reach
as many people as possible, sharing the accumulated knowledge we have
gained of both Middle Ages.  When the occation should arise where one
does *not* wish to have things spread any further than the net,  a
simple copyright notice will make it evident to all and sundry,
and you can reasonably expect to be contacted by anyone who wishes
to use your work.

	In the US (other nations may differ (*will* differ)) a 
limited copyright protection can be gained simply by adding:

Copyright (c) 1988 by (State your name)

This gives your work full copyright protection in the US and
most nations.  There is a further level of protection, allowing for
various monetary reparation and damages should someone violate
your copyright, but somehow I don't see anyone needing that level
of protection here!  The above copyright statement should be sufficient
to let people know that you wish to be notified of any use of your work
before it is used.  If you feel uncomfortable allowing it out
with even this much protection, DON'T POST IT!  But for most of us 
and certainly for myself, this should be enough.

	Thank you, and I hope to see a goodly number of you
at Pennsic.

Subject: This Net thing here

The name I've been leaning towards, a modification of a suggestion of David
le Casse's, is House Ethereal. It's pretty close to House Ephemeral, but it
also puns on the fact that a good portion of the net's connections are
Ethernetted together. The first edition of the net domesday book is going to
be called the Rolls Ethereal, unless someone comes up with a better idea
before I put it out.

While I'm on the subject -- I've decided to delay the release of the Rolls
until after Pennsic. This was for several reasons: I decided, upon reflection,
that there probably isn't going to be much call for printed copies to be
sold at Pennsic; I don't want to get home from Pennsic (I'm leaving tonite),
and discover 150 messages, due to people making corrections, sending new
entries, etc.; and most importantly, I haven't figured out how to print to
disk from dBase III yet. Probably sometime in the week after the War, I'll
send the Rolls over the net.

(Oh, yes, while I'm on *that* subject -- could someone with a really good
news connection volunteer to be the posting point? My articles don't seem
to be propagating through the gateway: my posted articles never get to the
mailing list, and my mailed articles never make it to alt.sca here. This
isn't too surprising -- my news feed is *terrible*. So, howzabout I mail
it to someone, who then posts it to alt.sca? Volunteers?)

From: Kevin William Ryan <kr0u+@andrew.cmu.edu>
Subject: Re: Fighting medievally (armor on the cheap)

   Well, I've finally done it.  I've given in to 'peer' pressure and fashion
and made an overtunic for my hideous white pickle-bucket armor.  Three years
of wearing white plastic with the bright yellow and black Barony Marche
tabard over it have ended.
   Actually, I had been planning to do this for some time.  The original cost
of materials for my armor was less than $40 when I made it, not counting the
leather arm harness (~$20), which is the major reason I made plastic armor.
The design is fairly good (lorica segmentata), but the materials are admittedly
ugly.  I just never seemed to get around to it before...
   For those of you who are interested in good looking armor without high cost,
there are a variety of options.  If you have armor made of plastic, PVC, Lexan,
fluted aluminum plates (its been done - a marshal nearly broke his knuckles
checking it), conveyor belt, or other unsightly materials, make a _large_ tunic
to go over it.  If you are interested in making your armor from the start, you
could go for brigadine; plates sewn/riveted/attached to exterior cloth, or a
variant which is popular around here; quilt the plates (~3-5 inches) between
two layers of heavy cloth, which form a tunic or tabard with shoulder flaps.
Belt it on over a good gambeson and you have just constructed your body armor.
(Incidentally, this has the nice feature of a heavy, plated flap between your
groin and the cruel world :-)  Just make sure your gambeson provides enough
padding.
   As to cuirbolli (hardened leather), the techniques mentioned before on this
bboard are excellent.  I believe that the original hardening material was
linseed oil or something similar (whatever is in oil paints), but that takes
an awful long time to dry in leather.  I've also heard of people who soak the
leather in fiberglass resin - although this leaves basicly no flex.  All of
these are ways of turning leather into a composite material, with fibers (the
leather) held in a matrix (wax, resin, etc.).  Note that this is perhaps as
expensive as the steel armor, but can be done without the resources of a metal
shop!
   And of course, there is always the option of carpet.  This can be made by
anyone, in a poorly lit closet, and provides excellent protection.  Cost is
miniscule.  (In my Barony, one of the fighters wears carpet armor.  Someone
from ? [mundane Texas] stared at him and said, "CARPET ARMOR!?  I've heard
stories about carpet armor...")  It's not highly fashionable, so you may wish
to throw a tabard over it, but it works wonderfully.

   Whew!  I see I've written quite a bit more than I originally intended.
Hope that some of this information is of use to folks.  In my next installment
I'll tell how to make ridiculously sturdy gorgets out of picklebucket scraps...

I have two questions.  Firstly, I was wondering if someone could possibly 
send me some of the SCA digests prior to #74 since I was just added to 
the list.  Email me a note first so I don't get 150 copies of each.  :^) 
I would also be happy if someone could point me to a site that I could FTP 
them from instead.

Secondly, I was wondering how common chromed chain is.  I have seen a 
helmet or two chromed, but I own (and made) the only chromed chain shirt 
I've ever seen.  It seems to wear better, be cleaner, and look nicer, 
but I would hate to have to pay to have it done.  (A friend was working 
on a bycicle chroming line. :^)  Sorry if this is old stuff and has been 
talked about a million times.  Such is life when new to a mailing list.

Picked up the new TI out of my mailbox last night (Aug 9) and while
I was reading it occurred to me that the rest of the known worlde
might be interested in knowing that we're here. Siobhan, would it
be appropriate to have a introductry note to the SCA Digest put in
the TI (who we are, how to get on the list, etc.)? Who knows, we might
gain a bunch of new members.

And while I'm here, I'd like to dredge up an old topic and ask for
an SCA euphenism for the Digest. Someone suggested House Ephemeral,
I've heard "Crystal Ball", "Air Mail" and "Elf-Mail (e-mail)" although
none of the latter have enough medieval flavour to sit right with
me. So - suggestions anyone? We need a medieval name for a bunch of
people who share a common interest, talk with each other daily and
yet never see each other's face or hear each other's voice. :-)

Yes, but absence of copyright notice does not necessarily imply absence
of copyright, even in published works.  There are countries where the notice
is essential; there are others where it's not.  I'm not sure exactly what
US law is these days, but there have been revisions to US copyright law
quite recently, so beware.

One of the largest complaints I have heard in the society is that people don't
do anything period. That they just dress up in garb and talk about Dr.Who. The
common refrain is that can't you keep that sort of thing away from the society.
I really don't think so, VERY few people do nothing but live and breathe the
society. Frequently our intrest outside the society overlap, most people in the
society are interested in Science Fiction, Fantasy, Gaming, computers, etc. Now
I have frequently heard something along the lines that but why do you have to
talk about it at (fighterpractice, feast, whatever), can't you do that some
other time? Frequently the only time I see people is at fighter practices and
such, it is a time that you more or less fit into your schedule, and since you
are there and see some people with whom you share a common extra-societal
intrest it is only natural for you to talk about it.
   Now my contention is that it is okay to talk about non-society things ant
society meetings (provided that you do it in a civil manner and try not to spoil
the illusion for others). Consider the common topics that most find offensive to
hear at society functions. Movies, television, and new (usually SF&F) books, yet
in the middle ages did they not talk of litrature? that latest book by that
fellow machiavelli, How is that so different from our movies etc. You can carry
this argument out for almost every topic under the sun. However the point is
that anything wich can be talked about is legitamate game because talking is a
period pursuit. However I think the most important thing to remeber when talking
about the last episode of ST:tng is to remember curtousy, to not spoil the
illusion for others. Yet if you enforce a ban on all modern topics than it gets
boring real quick and people don't stay in boring societies.

These are good primary considerations; let me add one more (from
experience): the user must be able to rapidly search for duplicates

for a normal database, since there are so many different ways to spell
a name (Liusaidh, pronounced (correctly) like "Lucy", for example).

This was of lesser concern for me, since my output device was at work
(I can't afford my own LaserWriter).  Being able to update at home is
a great help (almost definite need), though.

For all of these reasons (and a few more), my database is stored in
the simplist of formats: a plain text file, sorted alphabetically.
Each person gets one line, in the general format

	name; award date; award date; ... award date

Then I made a couple of coustom C programs to hack apart the entries
and sort them in various ways, and Lorimbor made a nice little TeX
macro that takes the input in the above format and produces multiple
column output.

Using a plain text file for the data was a real win: I can edit it
easily and rapidly, transfer it to just about any type of computer
(with any communications program; I use Kermit), and generally hack it
into submision.

I also track all of my revisions to it using RCS.

The whole system (except for RCS, which is nice but not absolutely
necessary) could (theoretically) run on a PC; TeX is availiable, the C
programs only use stdio and qsort, and the shell scripts are
translatable into command files.

Lorimbor and I have made all of the programs and macros public domain;
anyone is free to use them if they like.  Send me mail for details.

As a matter of SCA policy, any official newsletter of any local group must
put any money received into the group bank account, which must bear
the SCA's taxpayer ID, not any individuals. Monies so collected
can only be used for the expenses of the newsletter and for the benefit of
the group, not any one individual.
 
If a SCA newsletter wants to, and can afford it, they can pay their authors.

Greetings, Gentles.

On the topic of things here being posted to the public domain:

I assume that this may be true for all original work.
Be wary that anything that I may say, for instance, may come from some other 
source which may already be copyrighted.  I do not believe (though I am 
willing to be corrected) that anything already copyrighted which is posted to 
this mailing list becomes public domain and may be *published*.   You may 
certainly be free to make photocopies of it and distribute it to your friends
for personal use, but actually publishing something without someone's express
consent just because it has been stated in a public place is not a good idea.

If you heard someone talking on a street corner about something you were 
interested in, I doubt that anyone would consider (1) publishing it without 
checking it out, and (2) attributing it to the person in question.  

Much of what I talk about here, I expect to be heard in public, but I don't 
think that it's admissible as evidence in court.  I could be easily be wrong 
here, by the way.

As a copyrighted and posted notice to the public domain, be warned that 
anything I say over this net may contain misinformation, inconsistencies, 
unreferenced quotes from other sources, and maybe even outright 
prevarications.  Quote me at your own risk.  This includes this statement, for

Greetings!

Since my suggestion about a general permission to print material from
the SCA Digest does not meet with the full support of all participants,
I will not demand that any such policy be forced on anyone.

I cannot abstain from championing the cause, however.

Money is irrelevant here, because the SCA is a non-profit organization,
and nobody will expect to get paid for what they write in an SCA news-
letter anyway. In fact, the subscription fees usually don't even cover
the cost of publishing, and many Chroniclers cover the difference out
of their own pockets.

It is *possible* that some jerk could print your non-copyrighted mate-
rial and try to sell it, but I would think that the commercial prospects
are hardly worth the effort. And that person would quickly earn the
disgust of everybody else in the Society, which makes it even less
worthwhile and less likely to happen.

We can also forget about the legal ramifications since the Digest is
Public Domain except where a text is expressly copyrighted. The
question is not about money or law, but about courtesy. Courtesy
demands that one should ask permission before publishing anything,
and that one should send a copy of the printed material to the author.
Courtesy would not be infringed if you *know* in advance that any-
thing you write in this forum can be printed in SCA newsletters.
And you would still have the option of stopping this by saying so in
your text.

The problem with having to ask permission is that if some time has
passed between the SCA Digest and the need to publish a text, the
author may have moved or become unreachable for some reason. Having
to meet a publishing deadline is a problem for Chroniclers, too, and
looking for lost authors takes a lot of time.

It is fairly easy to get around all the practical problems by simply
re-writing the text, adding on information from other sources and
using other techniques to make it different from the original. Then
you publish it under your own name and quote the original text as
one of the sources. This sort of thing is frequently done, both in
the SCA and elsewhere. I find it distasteful because it must be better
if the original author is given all the credit he deserves, i.e. the
text is published unaltered and under his name. Still, such re-writing
is the last resort when the author cannot be reached. It is an unfor-
tunate consequence of the copyright hassle.

Since there are those who feel uncomfortable with a default permission
to publish without asking, let us not force this upon them. But let us
at least help each other by giving such permissions *in our text* when-
ever we write something that could possibly be of interest to SCA news-
letters, and which we do not want to protect for some special reason.

your servant,
William de Corbie

Subject: Little Folks at Events

I'm in the process of scanning two weeks worth of mail - holidays y'know -
and I see a couple of questions concerning smalls/little folk/childer/children
at events. In An Tir we have a minor office called "Pied Piper" who is
a person responsible for organizing things to do for 10-and-unders.
(The assumption being that by about 10 yrs, a person has found his/her
own interests and is more-or-less responsible for their own behavior.)

I've seen Pied Pipers providing "Day Care" including toys and art materials
(but not snacks) and I've seen Pied Pipers organize a "Babysitters Co-op"
with parents responsible for minding the entire pack - 'scuse me - group
for a couple hours out of the day.

All this from an observer's point of view - I'm a modern batchelor auntie.

I am Lord Dagonell Collingwood of Emerald Lake, better known to my friends
as Dagonell the Juggler.  My lady, Lady Cigfran o Caer Gwalch, and I will
be camping in Duke Cariadoc's "Enchanted Ground" encampment.  The "Enchanted
Ground" is an "in persona" campsite.  Our tent is probably the easiest to spot.
Look for a 13 1/2' tall white tent with green trim.  If you wish to try
camping in persona, please come join us.  (It's not all that difficult, if you
HAVE to talk about something modern, just step outside the camp.)

My barony, which has been avidly devouring all the printouts of this
newsgroup is the Barony of the Rhydderich Hael.  The baronial pavilion is
painted with the barony's arms and I have been told it can be seen from the 
road.  The arms are: Per pale vert and sable, a dragon rampant or. (For us
non-herald types, that's green on the left, black on the right and a yellow
dragon standing on one foot)

I am looking for the Innkeeper named Rhiannon.  I am a storyteller and I
would like to be able to tell appropriate tales at the "ethnic night" she runs,
but I need to know which ethnic she's chosen.  (The Enchanted Land has a
medieval bardic circle every night. All are welcome to join us.  By medieval,
I mean NO "No Sh*t, There I was..." stories and NO filks.)

William De corbie suggested that all things printed here be publishable by
general consensus. I disagree. If you want to publish something that someone
posted than contact the person who posted it. Now a lot of people ask why or
what does it matter?
   Allmost all newletters have a subscription fee (sometimes almost invisible
but there none the less). So someone is getting money from the arcticles printed
but not the author of the article. In addition one of the nicest things in the
world is for someone to say that "gee, I liked you posting on hanging period
strung rutabagas, could I publish it in our local newsletter?" with a general
consensus type thing you might not ever know that something you wrote was
published and in addition you have no control over what they do to your words.

Someone published a selection of things off of Dead-Flames and sold them at a
concert, word got around and a lot of people were upset.

In short if you want to publish something don't be a lazy spineless slime, at
least send the author an E-mail and ask his permission. It is not that tough.

Subject: Publishing the Digest

Good Gentles:
 
Lord William de Corbie is correct in his assertion that the new
publications policy *does* encourage publications to allow others
to use articles and so on *if the author has previously given
permission for such a thing!* Mailing lists and digests, since
they do not have a copyright statement but are considered one
form of publication, put us on on the thin edge of the wedge.
 
I, too, would like to use some of the material here, as I have
suggested to Lady Rosalinde De Witte (editor of TI) that some
things would make the basis of fine TI small articles. But I
would expect to ask the author before I just grabbed something.
 
Be that as it may, I would like to encourage people to allow
others to use their material and anecdotes, *with permission
given on request.* Our newsletters are, as Lord WIlliam points
out, crying for material, and we have a wealth of information and
expertise available.
 
Let us NOT descend to the point of unchivalrous behavior, where
we call each other names such as "lazy spineless slime." I'm sure
such epithets are the result of an ill-considered moment, and
would have been recalled if only there had been a way.
 
This is an excellent idea, which needs to be refined. Let us do
so in the spirit of the Society in which we live. After all, one
of the comments we have most often seen in discussions about
whether to more widely distribute this list is the hope that we
should not descend to the level of flame-throwers and contention.
We are, after all, Ladies and Lords in service to Chivalry.

There are two ways of looking at it.

Legally, if one posts a writing to a digest, alt.sca, or any public forum,
and does not copyright his article, then by definition that writing has been
released into the public domain. Anyone else can do what they will with it:
sell it, publish it, or even make T-shirts out of it.

So legally, the SCA can publish uncopyrighted material that was posted
posted to one of these digests with no worries of legal repercussions. There
are plenty of precendents for this.

Of course, the SCA would never hear of doing such a thing, because this may
not be in the author's intentions. Looking at it honor-wise, the only right
thing to do is ask the author for permission to redistribute.

The moral of the story is: if you're the SCA, the polite thign to do is ask,
if you're an author, copyright your stuff.

Distribution via electronic means is considered publishing.

That means all correspondence/postings to SCAnet are PUBLISHED.

If these postings do not contain a copywrite notice they are in "THE PUBLIC
DOMAIN".  You may republish them without any legal ramification.

It may be polite to "ASK" the author if he would "mind" his work be re-
published.  In general, the author's are FLATTERED by the thought.  Some-
times they have a BETTER VERSION to send you.

	Well, I'm another one who is planning on going to the war, but
I have a problem.  I need to get a ride out.

	I can't get the whole week off, so I need to find someone who
is going out on Wed, or later.  I could probably get off Tuesday, too,
but I'm not sure.

	So, is there anyone going Tuesday (Aug 16) or later, who could
stop by Chicago on the way to help out a fellow SCAer who wants to go
to his first war?  I would greatly appreciate any help, as it doesn't
look like anybody in my group is going that late.

	Sorry to post this throughout the US, but I wanted to pick up
anybody west of here who might be coming through close to here.

	If you can't get email through, try calling (305)643-8124.

As the Chronicler of my local SCA group, I have found several
stories, letters and articles in the SCA Digest which I would
like to print in our newsletter - wether translated into Swe-
dish or as they stand (most people here read English without
trouble). There have been very knowledgeable articles on such
subjects at Archery, Leather Armor, Demos and the SCA in gene-
ral.

To facilitate the further dissemination of all this knowledge,
let me propose that we all agree on making the Digest freely
publishable within the SCA. Let "default" be that anything in
the Digest may be printed in SCA publications without having
to ask special permission from the author. Of course, full cre-
dits should be given and the source should be quoted. Those
who do not want their material published might simply state
this somewhere in the text, e.g. "Not for publishing without
specific permission".

Such a general agreement would be in accordance with the gene-
ral policy of the Society, as stated in the Society Publica-
tions Handbook (draft of April 1988), where newsletters are
encouraged to give such a general permission.

your servant,

Hmmmm....I don't know about vitamin c, but from personal experience I've found
that Brewers Yeast tablets will do the trick. You have to make them a regular
part of your diet though. Just taking them the week of the event won't do it.

Brewers Yeast is a natural b vitamin complex. If you are an "outdoorsie" kind
of person, I'd recommend adding it into your daily supplement. I'm outdoors
a lot.....here it is August.....and I haven't been bitten by any bugs yet!!!
Which makes me think I should mention that Brewers Yeast keeps away other
bugs as well.

I am right now in the process of making my first suit of armor and the
type I decided on was cuirbolli.  The method that was shown to me is
very similar to other account's I'v read here on the net which
involves soaking the leather in a hot (but not scorching) mixture of
paraphin and a wax hardner.  

A twist to this process though is that since I am making a coat of
cuirbolli scales I wanted to have different colors of leather.  To do
this I dyed the leather first with Tandy Pro-dye.  What I found was
that when the leather is soaked in the wax the color of the leather
darkens and produces a chocolate/burgandy type color that is very hard
to cover up.  I got my best results by dying the leather as dark as I
could before soaking it.  Essentially the more I covered up the
original color of the leather the better my results.  I also added
candle dye to the wax which added slightly to the depth of the color.
In the end the resulting scales which began as bright green, became a
dark almost black forest green.

I now have 200 green and 200 natural shield shaped cuirbolli scales
and I'm working on a coat to rivet them onto.  I know I'll probably
need more scales to cover a proper length coat but right now I'm
concentrating on the coat.  If anyone has completed a suit of leather
scales, cuirbolli or natural, I'd really appreciate any advice you can
give me.  :-)

Happy armoring!

Subject: How to break into the SCA

Hmm... right after writing one of my patented digressions on Demos, the other
side of the question comes up. How *does* one break into the Society in a
painless way? Since there appear to be a pretty substantial number of novices
on SCAnet, it's a useful question.  I suspect that this varies a *lot* from 
group to group, but here's one or two pieces of advice based on my local 
experience. (I'll try to make this digression a little shorter than the last).

1) In the particular case of Lady Darlene, your name may be giving you
trouble. Does the local group know that you're new? In the SCA, a title 
such as "Lady" is meant to be earned, not assumed. One problem I've
noted a lot in the past few years is that experienced SCAdians come to 
Carolingia from outside, and get treated as novices for the first six months,
because everyone assumes that they're new. You may be experiencing the flip
side of this coin; since you're calling yourself a Lady, people *may* be
assuming that you're experienced, and don't make all the usual introductions. 
(Indeed, some of them may be a little intimidated. Depends on the group).

2) Try to find out what the group is interested in, and come to practices
and things. Around here, the fastest way to get involved is to show up at one
of the practices or meetings: storytellers, fighting, dancing, cooks, and
many others work quite well as means of "breaking in". If people just see you
at events, they don't get to know you as well.

3) For just "finding out what's going on", I recommend getting one or two of
the better publications that the SCA puts out. In particular, "The Known World
Handbook" is a thick tome describing a little of almost every activity that
the SCA indulges in. The SCA director of Publications, Siobhan, is around
here somewhere; I'm sure she could give you the address of the stock clerk.
(Real Soon Now, I'll be putting out the "phone book" for the SCAnet, so getting
peoples' addresses will be easier).

4) Have patience. Most SCAdians are a little shy, and tend to develop circles
that, from the outside, appear impenetrable. In general, if you are just
friendly to people for a while, you'll find yourself getting accepted by
them. It just takes a little time.

Good Luck -- I hope to run into you at an event sometime!

Subject: period rapier combat: the "armor"

Malice asks if any gentle has researched "what period rapier contestants 
used for armor."

I have, my lady, and the armor worn by the contestants depends on ones 
viewpoint, the type of duel, and ones national custom.

To overly simplify the answer:

	Italians: wore a chainmail shirt and generally fenced "'til first blood"
		italians were considered leaders in this martial art during 
		the 16th and 17th century.
	Frenchmen: generally duels were to the death... and wore NO ARMOR at
		all.
	English: argued over fencing and thought it more a carnival act than
		a marshal art.  Fencing in England did not gain much momentum
		until the 17th century.  Duels, at that time, where fairly 
		rare and not usually fatal.  My sources do not indicate any
		mail.  Buff-coats of elk were worn by guardsmen in the 17th
		century.
	German: Did not enthusastically fence until mid 17th century.  There
		is indication that what fencing that was available used a
		padded doublet during practice.  German's are well known for
		their first-blood duels.  These were in practice until the 
		20th century.
	Spain: fencing was complicated into a religion and generally limited 
		to the noble class.  My sources do not describe any use of mail
		by the Spanish for rapier duels.

To sum up these answers:
	armour:
		mail (for duels and practice)
		elk-doublet (depending on the cut,
				potentially pushing definition of "period")
		padded doublet (known to be used for practice, not stated
				whether it was used for duels)

	clothing:
		street cloths (dueling has been rumoured to have given
				rise to the "slashes" fashion of the 
				late 16th and 17th century)

Those who question the validity of a fencing touch should consider what the
bout is proving.  If one is duelling, (lets be forcefully clear, rapier combat 
is an "honourable" contest between individuals, it is not a warfare martial 
art.  The results of this contest does not show the power of one ruler over 
another, but proves "truth" to the medieval/renaissance man.  For he believes,
that God guides the rapier and the result of a contest or duel is God's will.)
one is letting the result of the bout prove the right-ness of his claim.  God
uses the duelists as tools to prove truth.  By not accepting a rightfully 
delivered "blow" or point, one denies God.  That denial, while dishonorable
and without chivalry (to the SCAdians and the audience of the duel), is also
is an act of SIN and blasphomy to the medieval or renaissance man.  It is the 
denial of truth, and it is every gentles duty to challenge this aggressor
in the name of Honesty and God.  

That is but a part of the philosophy of the Duel.

I hope to write more about this philosophy during Pennsic, I plan to print it
here after that event.

For honesty, truth, and justice,
