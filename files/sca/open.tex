\Large Recrimination Phase

I deliberately didn't check one fact in the last \ul{\em Wild Hunt} in order
avoid generating another (almost empty) page. Therefore, the paragraph in the
first column on page 8 that starts "In the afternoon mail \ldots" should read:

In the afternoon mail was a letter for Famine. The author was Patrick Kennedy,
the (former) Lord Mayor of Belfast. (Belfast, in the days after Halloween, was
overrun by the ghosts of all those who had died over the centuries in the
struggle for control of the land. Unlike the usual ghost these could directly
affect the living - thousands died in the rampage before the city could be
evacuated.) Kennedy wanted his city back and hoped the American 'ghost' could
help. Sympathetic, Famine decided on an epistolary relationship: while he had
no reservations about visiting the Republic (and indeed planned to do so in
the near future to do additional research), personal involvement with the
Ulster situation would bring him too close to a lot of issues he wasn't ready
to deal with. Besides his powers dealt with a very narrow phenomenon. No
authority guaranteed he and the other ghosts shared any mystic properties.
