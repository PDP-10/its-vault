Actually my preference would be to have them send their own letters
of recommendation with a copy to you.

I know a couple of people in our shire that would like to have some 
aoa's but they just haven't done anything and would be just like that.

Good my lady Ariel, I sympathize with your problem.  I suspect it is
not uncommon, especially in the more remote parts of any Kingdom,
where the number of members of the higher orders is small.

On one hand, you've got to expect this sort of thing.  One of your
duties as a Companion of an order is to be aware of who is doing
valuable work, and who ought to receive recognition.  People bring
their recommendations to you because you DO have a somewhat bigger
say.  It is not for nothing that many scrolls refer to companionship
in an order, and "the rights and duties pertaining thereunto".
                                 ^^^^^^

However, I think part of your problem may be that many people in your
area don't understand that ANYONE can (and should!) make award
recommendations to the Crown.  Tell them so: If they all write letters
to the Crown, the award is much more likely to be given than if they
leave it to you.  Thank them for their thoughts, and tell them you
will keep them in mind.  

	Arval
	Companion of the Silver Crescent.

Subject: gay monarchs

To the gentles of the Rialto,

Goodness... I miss a few digests and all of a sudden I see this storm 
over whether or not gay monarchs should be able to choose same-sex 
consorts.  Anxiety about this kind of thing was something of a major 
issue for me when I joined the society.  I am rather unlikely at this 
point to end up having to choose a consort in a crown tourney, but 
nonetheless, the almost overwhelming heterosexism of the society can
make someone like myself a little uncomfortable. 

Since heterosexuals are used to seeing themselves and their lifestyles 
as "normal" and "natural", few are aware of the ironic double standard 
applied to homosexuals.  We are allowed to exist (at least among the 
more tolerant) as long as we don't "flaunt it".  However, ever scadian 
dance, every tourney filled with knights graced with their lord's or 
lady's favors, every court, and every little social interaction flavored 
with friendly flirtatiousness flaunts, extols, and enforces heterosexual
courtship and mating rituals.  It is impossible to avoid being inundated 
by it.

For a homosexual, the smallest things can be fraught with real and 
imaginary perils that the average heterosexual hasn't a glimmer of.
Maybe my story of "what-to-wear" might illustrate the point a little 
bit.  [apologies for telling part of my how-I-met-the-sca tale over again.]
I went through a lot of trauma at my first major activity (which
happened to be Pennsic) deciding what to wear (since you are what you
wear, to a large extent, in sca-land).  In mundane existence it is possible
to choose a non-commitally androgynous style, but in these current
middle ages it is much harder.  What one wears declares one's role, and
the binding between gender and role behavior is very, very tight.  Many
people have trouble making a distinction between maleness and
"masculine" behavior and femaleness and "feminine" behavior in the best
of times, somehow assuming that one proceeds automatically from the
other as if it were ordained by <ultimate being of your choice>.  And of
course one of the biggest assumptions of such behavior is an orientation
toward the opposite sex. I have no taste for fitting into a "feminine"
role generally, and at the beginning the thought of wearing a gown,
being called "my lady" by chivalrous gentlemen, and <gasp> being 
expected to dance with men, filled me with panic.  At the same time, I
was unsure if it was safe to wear male garb or what that would mean.  

I hit upon a very period solution -- I went as a nun.  It declared me a
non-player in the default mating game and made me feel fairly
comfortable -- except after a few days or so of 90 degree heat in a
black habit. I ended up stitching up a tunic by hand and throwing it
over my chemise to be cooler.  I suddenly became a "lady".  I had the
interesting reaction of feeling weak and vulnerable and "in disguise"
(which may seem like an odd thing for someone who loves to run around in
medieval outfits to say, but it has to do with some kind of fundamental
misrepresentation of self).  Being single, I also realized that if there
were any other females out there who might be players in the same mating 
game that interested me, they'd probably never know I was available.
And shy as I am, I do like to play the game too, once in a while.
I realized more than I ever had before how those of us who break with 
our fundamental role expectations in the matter of sexual orientation 
often give off "gender-bending" clues (pink polo shirts for men, 
flattops for women, etc) in order to find each other.  I finally worked
up an outfit for court that consisted of a borrowed doublet, some 
mundane pants rigged up as venetians, and a zippy little feathered hat.
I looked very Genoese, one lady told me.  At that point I realized I was 
emotionally comfortable with myself.  And on my last day, when I was 
running around in a tunic (sans chemise), with baggy pants and one of 
those very butch leather belts favored by the stick jock classes, a lady
finally expressed to me her loneliness for the evening, but it was 
too late.  [I would like to state that I am not a lustful lesbian who 
joined the sca to meet hot babes in kirtles -- I am actually a rather 
shy and quiet individual, and quite respectful of the fact that almost 
all other women will never be other than friendly acquaintances, or at 
best objects of unrequited devotion].

Anyway, that might all seem like a rambly and pointless story, but I 
hope it illustrates a little bit how when one doesn't belong to the 
default group, one's "difference" becomes very much a burning, every day 
issue fraught with questions of one's true identity.  I won't even get 
into the gyrations I've gone through trying to choose a name and 
persona, or the hand-wringing I went through when I went to my first 
dress-up dance and worried about whether I would be able to dance with 
ladies and if that would be ok and what they would think of it and what 
I should answer when the first person I spoke to asked if he should call 
me "my lord" or "my lady".  I am grateful to say that I live in a fine 
barony, and that much of what I agonized over in private seems to have 
turned out to be a non-issue.  Most people admire my garb, and there are 
enough partnerless ladies out there that I can usually dance
without it being any kind of earth-shattering issue, and I've learned 
not to mind dancing on the distaff side with men whom I think of as 
friends.  But it is worth mentioning that these things are issues for 
me, and for a heterosexual they never come up.

Of course it bothers me that a heterosexual has the option of choosing
his or her beloved as a consort, while that option is categorically
denied to me and my kind.  I want to fight for a lady, and live out my
own chivalrous fantasies.  Why, in this land of make believe, is that
denied to me?  In a world where one runs the risk of being assaulted on 
the street for looking like a dyke or a faggot, such injustices are 
certainly minor.  But they are injustices all the same -- little 
irritations that add to the dis-integration many of us experience in 
keeping our loves and a fundamental part of who we are separate from
the rest of our lives.  I'm not sure anyone else can understand the kind of 
psychological mutilation it is to have to have to deny oneself in that 
way.  The rest of you get to carry on your courtships in 
public, get approval and celebrations for your mating, get to write 
songs, poems, plays, and great literature about your attachments, have
your families treated as sacred institutions whose bonds are holy and
good, while the rest of us have to hide whom we love and who we are, and
defend ourselves against accusations of shame, sin, and illegality.  I
don't like it, and I don't like anything that contributes to
legitimizing this assault against our humanity. 

I consider the "not period" arguments to be so much rationalization for 
the way things are.  Much of the sca is "not period" -- we are far from 
being a faithful recreation of medieval society.  What we choose to 
allow or not allow that is "not period" is an indication of our values.
Certainly there were many homosexual sovereigns in the period, although 
admittedly most of them married consorts of the opposite sex out of
political duty and kept their lovers in the shadows on the side.  Lots 
of Spanish Moors pretended to be Christians, too.  The hatred and 
intolerance vented on Jews, Muslims, and women during the period are very
authentic, but is at least considered impolite to openly express in the
world today.  I doubt anyone would consider saying it isn't period to
have a Jewish sovereign, for example.  But because hatred and
intolerance toward homosexuals are still completely valid in the world
today, and the religions that once felt it a holy duty to kill Jews and
Muslims and old women still feel it is ok to dehumanize homosexuals, we
can come up with good rational-sounding excuses for why gay men and
lesbians ought to be stuffed into the closet and have the doors nailed
shut by the good people of the sca.  The attitude doesn't surprise me at
all, but I wish that it wouldn't try to hide behind a seemingly pious
and rational facade.  Discrimination on the basis of whom I choose to 
love is unfair and it hurts, and whether or not such unfairness is 
period or expedient changes it not one whit.

Yours,

Jehanne du Lac du Flamant,
Barony of Carolingia

Ian Aelfstan Mallory asks if anyone else does bar brawls.
 
Barony Rivenstar has been doing them at Feast of Fools for a
number of years, I'm told.  I witnessed one--the rules seemed
to be exactly as you say.  Master Moonwulf, Baron Rivenstar
was deeply involved in the organization--he seemed to be both
barkeep and referee.  Tankards and the like were the weapons,
swords and shields were checked at the door, but it seems to me
there was some procedure whereby you could exit, pick them up
and fight.
 
As a spectator, I laughed myself silly.
 
This spectacle was complemented in the evening by "Not the Court
of Not Their Majesties Elen and Eliahu" (everyone put on their
groucho marx glasses) which made Palymar a "Court Duke" (complete
with tinfoil crown).
"Oh, too bad...We didn't have a seneschal.  It isn't legal.
Sorry Palymar"
 
End of Court of Fools, and entrance of Kingdom Seneschal
(everyone removes groucho marx glasses).  Herald says "The court
of their Mediterranean Majesties..."

My lord you are  quite correct.  Now I know what bothered me about the
original posting.  It was Philip Agust who was contemporary of Richard
+later John.   I would be rather surprised if Richard + Philip got
along, considering that Richard's favorite pastime, aside from
leading Crusades+being held captive, was kicking Philips butt around
Normandy.  (Later, Philip would take Normandy from John and expand
the power of the French King's reaign beyond the Paris. Hence the
name Augustus.)
Then (St) Louis IX was contemporary of Henry III +
Edward I.  He was followed by Eds II (the sequel, not as good as
the first) and Ed III (The Search for France)  Philip the Fair
was the heir of Louis IX and the cousin of the Eds. (HIII married
LIX's sister and LIX did the same for HIII.)  Philip was a bit of
weinie, if memory serves me correct.  He got his butt kicked in
a campaign against some Papal enemy (Hohenstaffen?) and spent the
rest of his reign looking for a war to win so he could 'redeem French
arms.' (They'd gone undefeated since Philip A.)  I think he was
the King who kidnapped the Pope and started the Babylonian captivity.

This is all from memory, so be patient of the flubs.

Subject: Richard Lionheart's telephone number
Message-ID:  <8904131352.aa06112@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>


Lords and Ladies of the Rialto,

The subject of Richard the Lionheart has reminded me of something I encountered
long ago in another place.  People willing to act as contacts for the SCA had
their phone numbers listed under the name "Richard Lionheart".  That way, if
you were in a strange place, all you had to do was look up Lionheart in the
phone book to find a contact person.  It's free, too, because the phone company
asks you how you want your name listed in the phone book.  A second listing
with a second name costs money.  It has the added benefit of allowing you to
screen callers.  If they ask for "Mr. Lionheart" you know they're a stranger to
you.  That means they're either SCA, or want to sell you something.

I think it would be good to encourage this practice.  It would make it easier
for people to find other SCA people.  We might expand the role a bit for such
peole to be hospitallers.  For example, a SCA person is traveling.  Their car
breaks down in a strange city.  They have no idea who's a reputable dealer or
not, they're stranded without any way to get to a motel, the local "Lionheart"
could help then out.  Such Lionhearts would be providing a useful service with
very little effort on their part.

In fact, the whole idea of Hospitallers is a good one.  A few years ago Aaron
the Black, a member of Saint John's Ambulance in Canada (one  of the surviving
services offered by the real Hospitallers) started a group of Hospitallers.  He
got permission from the mundane Hospitallers to use their device (white Maltese
cross on a black field) and began providing emergency services.  (He was
paramedic so he acted as a chirurgeon, but he also offered up spare sleeping
space. He was also a former boy scout troop leader who had old boy scout tents).

At Pennsic on more than one occasion bad weather has rendered many people
homeless, wet, and hungry with no dry place to sleep, no dry clothes to change
into, and no edible food.  The Dark Horde has done handsome service by feeding,
warming, and housing lots of these people.  Seems to me emergency
accomodations of this sort could be an adjunct to the services of the
chirurgeons.

I'd appreciate any comments on this subject, also, I've lost contact with
Aaron.  If anybody knows where he is or how to reach him, I'd appreciate it.
His mundane name is Bob Pine.

Yours in Hospitality,

Yes, I've heard of "brawls" for rattan fighters.  There was an "improvised
weapons melee" in  Septemtria, Ealdermere, Midrealm that was a  tourney requiring
the use of SCA legal, improvised weapons of various natures.  It was quite
successful.  Novices had a better chance than they usually get in tourneys-some
of the better fighters were rapidly eliminated because they were laughing too
hard to defend themselves.

I've heard of others, but don't know any of the details.  Sounds like fun to
me. (Hmm.  Hey Dougal, want to autocrat an event?)

Philip the Fair was (I think) the contemporary of Henry IV.  Henry would
have inherited the throne of France upon Philip's death, but died one
year before.  Philip Augustus, the contemporary, alleged lover of Richard
I, was called Augustus because he was the first strong French king to come
along in quite a while.

Subject:  Silly tourneys; Alternate personae; Silver Crescent

Greetings!

First things first:  I *love* hearing about all these "And Now for Something
*COMPLETELY* Different" Tourneys!  More, please!!

Regarding alternate personae, and without respect to opinion:  everyone seems
to be overlooking what registering lots of different names equally (as opposed
to one primary name/persona) would do the the Registry and their work load!
They ain't got but 24 hours in a day, y'know!

There's also the Heralds and Scribes:  one of the purposes of having a primary
name is to permit people preparing awards and their scrolls to have a uniform
name to put them in!  It's also useful for people making awards
recommendations, and even decisions.  One primary name means less confusion as
to who is being referred to.  I mean, picture it:  the Crown figures these 42
Letters of Recommendation are for 6 different people, when it's really only
gentle known by 6 names!  No, thanks all the same!

By the way:  it was *years* before the College of Arms unbent enough to allow
the registration of alternate personae _via_ badges, and there is a limit to
how many of these you can register (I thinks it's eight, but I'm not sure).
And, *that* was a begrudging compromise.

About Lady Ariel of Caer Myrddin's problem with her Silver Crescent:  I
wholeheartedly agree with Ellisig Flakkingskvinne.  When anyone gives you that
kind of problem about *any* award, your first response should be:  "Have you
written a letter of recommendation for them?"  Nine times out of 10, the
answer will be "No."  To which you respond by politely pointing out that
without letters of rec., how is the Order to know who to consider, or have
documentation to back up their decisions?

If the answer is "yes," refer them to the Crown and/or the Principal of the
Order.  All kinds of screw-ups are possible; and in the event the gentle in
question was considered and not voted in, then the Crown or Principal are in
the best position to field such questions.

Either way, try not to let it get to you.  If you keep smiling, giving
consistent answers, and deferring, this too shall pass!

 I, too have seen the bar brawl in the Barony of Rivenstar.  There were
three teams: The bar keep and his help, the group of rowdies that comes in,
and the constables who come in and try (not real hard) to break up the fight.

Some of the various weapons included a nice tankard, a couple of LARGE wine 
bottles, a torch (complete with crepe paper "flames"), a potted palm tree
(it was interesting to see the fighter with the palm fronds hanging off his

basket hilt) and one particular female fighter brought in a "baby" (a mace
wrapped in a blanket).

This particular bar was, I think, a wee bit small, since the patrons of the
bar kept falling out of bounds through the "walls". But, a fun time was had
by all, and most people wanted to keep going.  Most people also wanted to 
do it this year too, but they fought the melays over an amardillo this year.

Subject: Bar Battles

  Lords and Ladies,
 I have, of late, been wondering if anyone in the East or Mid Kingdoms would
knowof Bar Battles(Brawls, Whatever) being waged by Rattan fighters.
 I am originally from Atenveldt, and these have been waged for at least the
past two years at the Estrella war between Atenveldt and Caid. Therefore I was
wondering if this has been attempted here, or even considered.
 The basic rules, as I remember them, 
1> No Polearms, Spears, Sheilds or Two-Hand Weapons allowwed (Other than
Bastard Swords). Fighters who wished to attempt to use these weapons were
allowed to leave them outside,(Presumably on their horse, Or in their "room")
of the area that was the tavern, and attempt to get them once the fight broke
out.(Who in their right mind would fight their way 40' to get a halbard in a
bar fight, I don't know. A small round shield on the other hand.) 
2> Some table were constructed for use as shields, should the inclination take
one. The tables that were solid you were allowed to use as, how shall we say,
Roadway?? But not allowed to attack from, or from on top of.
3> 'Improvised' weaponry was allowed. As long as it was constructed in such a
way as to meet SCA Safety specs. Some wondeful things were come up
with. Tankards(Of course), Bottles of wine, A haunch of beef(Someone tried to
get that outlawed as a Two-Handed weapon), And other such items.

 It was not particularly Chivalrous, but was fun. Also, it seemed to open up
wonderful was of justifying a battle or two in the War. (You'd be amazed at
what some people will call nobility just to start a fight.) (It should be
hauled away AS garbage!!) Sorry. 
 I would appreciate anyone with information about battles like this, or
alternatly, why they are not done here in the East. Or why they should NOT be
done, or should be done.
                                        
                                                Cordially,

Subject: same sex crown

All right, you've convinced me.  Same-sex crowns are a terrible idea.  Assume 
the fighter fights for the person who inspires him(her). ( i will now proceed 
to name names.  I imply ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about the persons named except that 
they have proven themselves to be sucsessfull fighters, and i have remembered 
their names (more or less)).  excercise in imagination:  Visivald and Fernando 
are old freinds, they work together well, they have a great deal of respect 
for each other. one fights for the other in the eastern crown lists.  
*interesting* reign.  o.k., i can imagine that scenario, what else can i 
imagine?  Sigfreid von Holstern & ferral formerly of frizia?  Randal & 
Morghun? Anghus mc dubh & Andrew of seldomrrest?

i think the gentle who was insistant that the king be capable of having 
children was on the right track, althogh he seems to have expressed it in a 
politically incorect manner.  the male/female pairing for the (real or) 
titular heads of a group of people is OLD, not just period.  It may for all i 
know be hardwired into the species.  what we seek in the sca is the flowering 
of creativity and courtesy, not the fertility of flocks and fields, but the 
principle is the same.

Well documented?!  I'd like to see ONE piece of reputable documentation
for this statement.  It has been repeated so often it has taken on the
force of fact, but I can't find a single of primary source for this
story.  Until someone shows me one, I'm going to continue to insist it's
legend, and totally unfounded.

[ The engineers report the enemy galley in flames, captain. ]

Sorry for the tone of that, my lord, but you pushed one of my buttons.
Richard I has taken so much abuse from historians, and been idealized by
so many storytellers, that the real Richard is hard to find.  I
recommend John Gillingham's _Richard the Lionheart_ as a useful attempt
by a reputable historian to accumulate the best evidence available.

As an aside, Richard's contemporary is best known as Phillipe Augustus.
Isn't Phillip the Fair someone else entirely, or am I not as
knowledgable about the Plantagenet's greatest enemy as I should be?

     Once more, for everyone who hasn't figured it out yet, WHAT YOU DO
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOUR CONSORT.
One's consort can be one's spouse or lover, a friend, or even a total
stranger (at least at the time of the tournament).
     Besides, what people "do behind closed doors" (assuming that that
means their sexual conduct with freely consenting adults) isn't really
any of our business, REGARDLESS of how they act in public.

     I'm not a herald, and I don't play one on TV, but at least I cant.
And now I'm going to have to recant.  Except that I'm not CAN'Ting, I'm
CANing.  You CAN register an alternate persona name if it's accompanied by
a badge.  This doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, because even if
you're wearing a great big tabard or something with your alternate-persona
badge on it, only some of your acquaintances are going to understand that
it means you aren't you.  Does anyone really want to have to make a point
of telling everyone they meet that if they've got a certain badge with
them, they're somebody else?
     The way I see it, anyone is free to use a pseudonym anyway, so why
bother to register an alternate persona?  Why not just tell people that
you will attend a certain event under an assumed name?  For that matter,
why even insist on changing your name?  Why not just wear different garb?
I wouldn't think of changing my name unless either it was rejected (fat
chance, there are so few Henries around that the chance of a conflict is
virtually zero), or unless I were going to an event with a non-European
setting where everyone was supposed to come in local garb AND under a
name appropriate to the setting.

There's no such thing as "all the words" to Old Time Religion...
the whole point of such songs is to make up verses on the spot!
In my opinion (obviously not shared with those who do it) one of the
fastest ways to ruin a bardic circle is to open up the songbook and
start singing Old Time Religion or Imperium Compound out of the book.

That aside, the Elf Hill Times Songbook has numerous verses to both
of those.  I had both the male and female versions of Moose, but since I
just moved last week I'm not sure where they've hidden themselves.  I
never heard of "Abuse" -- if it's not blatantly obscene, how about
posting it?

Message-Id: <4695@pt.cs.cmu.edu>

In a recent missive, Ariel of Caer Myrddin described the problem of being
deluged by requests to "get So-And-So a Silver Crescent" as soon as she was
given the award.

My lady, I have been a Silver Crescent since last July (so it's still fairly
new to me as well), but I have not experienced the problems you've described.
Of course, we have several members of the order down here; if you're one of
a very few in your area, I can see how it would happen.

There is a very simple answer to these people who plague you.  Tell them to 
write their nominee in to the Crown, and you'll examine the situation when
the person shows up on the poll.  It doesn't take much to get someone on the
poll; anyone can write a recommendation.  (Randal and Katherine included on
the poll everyone who was written in.  It looks like Morguhn and Rowan are
doing the same.)  The *only* case where your dangly might make a diffference 
in getting someone on the poll is if a particular set of royalty decides to
give more weight to recommendations from within the order.  But once someone
is on the poll, all Crescents are pretty much equal, and the person will only
get the award (in the general case...) if *most* of the order is convinced.
I haven't been to an order meeting yet, so my votes have come entirely from
personal knowledge and conversations with other Crescents.  (You should plan
on your phone bill going up a bit....)

Actually, your hardest task will probably be this: when So-And-So's name does
come up on the poll, you should work very hard to make sure you don't downgrade
your vote just because the person has obnoxious friends.

Don't crawl under a table and hide; just tell these people to write the person
in themselves.  If you're feeling particularly assertive, you might mention
how rude this behavior of theirs is, too.

Good luck to you!

Message-ID:  <8904121524.aa16134@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

A while ago someone asked for advice about how to make fighting more
interesting for non-participants.  A similar subject came up at the planning
meeting for Crusade of the Bright Rose (official war practice for Atlantia and
East theis year).

Non-fighters don't have to watch fighting.  It is, after, not the be all and end
all of the SCA.  One period entertainment that I like is for the less physical
members of the Society: Chess.

Played with medeival variants, it can be a lot of fun.  It is especially fun
trying to watch experienced chess players trying to figure out how to cope with
unfamiliar rules.   A while back I co-autocratted an event where we had a
Chocolate Chess Tourney.  Now chocolate is out of period-but it's such a little
sin for so much fun.

At the lower levels palyers played medieval variants.  For the finale, the
 four finalists played Four Seasons chess with the chocolate pieces of four
 different colors. They got to eat the pieces they captured. 

Each player sat at his corner with half the usual number of pieces and
wondered how in the heck he was going to play.  It attracted a large crowd of
spectators (an unusual phenomenon in its own right) all of whom were offering
excellent advice, such as "Capture the white piece, George!  I want to taste it!"

Alas, pieces were devoured faster than strategy progressed, and the game was
declared a draw.  The spectators demanded that I do it again. And  I might.

Before the flame-wars start, stop and think how many of the past sovereigns

I don't think anyone is saying that we shouldn't allow homosexuals
in the society, merely that consorts should be of opposite sex.
One's royal consort is most definitely a matter of PUBLIC knowledge,
and not of something going on behind closed doors.

Hello.
Due to an unexpected sudden move to a new disk (hi bart!)
I lost some files. One was the words to Moose, the other
was the words some kind gentle had sent me to Abuse.
Could someone re-mail them to me and to another gentle,
brandeis.edu!adam@cs who wants them. Adam and I also want to
collect all the verses to "old time religion", the song you
hear at bardic circles that has a chorus of

gimme that old time religion,
gimme that old time religion,
gimme that old time religion, 
it's good enough for me

and verses like

let us all bow down to Loki
he's the Norse god of chaos
now i know this doesn't rhyme or scan
but i think that's how he'd like it.

please mail them to me at the address below, AND if
you can also to Adam at the address above.

We'll post the results when compiled.

thanks!

yaakov,
in somerville, NJ (about 20 minutes north of you on route 206)
there is a homebrew store that sells wine stuff. They'll have
yeast, get Montrachet, it is the most reliable. They also have
books on making mead, get the one by Acton and Duncan, and be
prepared to use a balance scale for your ingredients. It's 
not period, but hey, for your first batches you don't want to
make poison!
 
Go on Nassau St. toward Trenton. Just at the edge of Princeton's 
campus there is a light with a funny fork and a memorial statue. 
Turn right here onto 206. (there are signs) Go north on 206 for 
about 20 minutes. You'll pass a lot of car dealerships, some 
fields, an airport, etc. When you are in Somerville (you'll be 
able to tell you're coming to a town) look for a Burger King 
and a Carwash on the right. The store is called Wine Hobby 
Store, and is in a small professional building just near the 
Burger King and the carwash.
			
You'll have to look closely, it is very easy to miss.
They have hours from about 9-3 on odd weekdays. Call them up
first, I'm fairly sure they are in the phonebook. The town
is either Somerville or the town just south of Somerville, 
Hillsborough. 

Good luck!

I wonder if my opinion hasn't been voiced before...

Your love can be your consort.
A friend of yours can be your consort.
You consort must be of the opposite sex.

These facts lead to an inconsistency. As usual, when solving an inconsistency,
you must choose preferences. What is most important: the rule that your 
consort must be of the opposite sex, or the rule that your mate can be
your consort ? There are other cases when your love can't be your consort
 - if your love is not in the SCA at all ! And conversely, if your love do
not fight, you must choose a fighter among your friends (or fight yourself).

Somebody compared this to the rule that prohibited women from fighting. But
the rule that women weren't allowed to fight EXCLUDED people from partaking
in some activities in the SCA. The rule that your consort must be of the 
opposite sex doesn't exclude anybody to fight for crown - he or she must
simply 'play the game' and choose a consort of the opposite sex. It had been
possible to solve the problem with women fighters in a similar manner by
requiring women to fight under a male persona (although this would certainly 
cause problems with the 'consort of opposite sex' rule :-). I guess that one 
of the reasons this solution wasn't chosen, was that there were enough evidence
that women fighters were, in fact, period. (It is also period to be gay, so I 
cannot see any problem with an openly - or almost openly - gay persona. There
are several interesting ways such a persona could be used.)

Now, there might be another reason for allowing consorts of the same sex:
the idea that the society should be a non-prejudiced organization, without
any discrimination whatsoever, and that its rules should not only be 
non-discriminating, but also be impossible to interpret as discriminating. I 
don't have very much arguments against this idea, only that however beautiful 
it is, this is NOT the purpose of the society. The purpose of the society is 
to provide an organization for people who want to study and reenact 'very old 
times'. I think that the society should not exclude anyone from partaking  - 
regardless of race, sex, disabilities, sexual preferences, religion or
whatever you can think of. For example, I see this principle as a valid reason
for prohibiting a mass to be the main activity at an event. But as long as
this principle isn't violated, I think the society's first concern is to
keep the reenactment reasonably truthful.

Also, we DO have members with views and beliefs like Lord Williams. I do not 
think we need to violate their beliefs either - or exclude them from some 
activities -  as long as their beliefs do not exclude someone else from
partaking in SCA activities.

While they were not, of course, married, Richard the Lionhearted and
Phillip the Fair of France _did_ have an active relationship.  This wasn't
common.  It wasn't legal or religiously acceptable.  The two monarchs
spent a great deal of their time in the Middle East instead of at home
where they might have gotten the same treatment as Edward II (?).  Still,
it happened in the Period and is fairly well documented. Neither king is

1) From Encyclopaedia Britanica 1978
Garter, Order of the, OF THE MOST NOBLE ORDER OF THE GARTER, English order
of knighthood founded by King Edward III around the middle of the 14th 
century. According to legend, it was established to commemorate an incident
in which the King returned a garter to a lady who had dropped it, and then
rebuked laughing bystanders with the words "Honi soit qui mal y pense"
("Shame to him who thinks ill of it."). This saying became the order's motto,
and appears on its insignia with the garter and the cross of Saint George.
Membership consists of the British sovereign and 25 knights companions, with
other members of the royal family as supernumeries. The chapel of the order
is St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.

2) I had understood that at one point about a year or so ago, there was a

homosexuality in period. Is there anyone within cast of this net who might

Message-ID: <890411193751.27.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

Some gentles on the net have given a translation of the mottoe of the
Order of the Garter which sounds a bit strange to me.

The mottoe (or, what the King said) is:
"Honi soit qui mal y pense"

The translation I have seen on the net is "Evil to him who thinks evil."

In my book, this is incorrect. The translation should be:
"Shame on him who thinks badly thereof", 
meaning "shame on you, milords, if you think that anything wrong
has been done here (referring to the dropping of the garter).

I will quote a bit about the Garter from a book called "Awards of
Honour". I have only some photocopies from this book, taken many
years ago, and stupidly I never noted the author's name.

"With respect to its origin, there appears to have been two popular but
legendary versions. Although the exact date of its foundation must be
regarded as uncertain, Seldon and Froissart concur in fixing the date of
institution to the 18th year of Edward III, when at the battle of Crecy,
the King ordered his garter to be displayed as the signal for the onset.
Other chroniclers (probably French) attributed its origin to a frivolous
incident associated with the Countess of Salisbury...whose garter, they
allege, fell off while dancing, and in rebuke of the levity this incident
aroused, the King uttered the words which were sunsequently adopted as 
the motto of the Order."

The book then goes on to quote a lengthy refutal of both these stories
as unhistoric, by someone called "Pote" whom I suspect may be an official
historian of the Order. I don't know what to believe; on the one hand,
the official historians may have wanted to cover up or explain away
any "frivolous" or un-Victorian origin of the Order - on the other hand,
it is perfectly possible that the romantic stories are just legends that
caught the public imagination and have little to do with reality.

Subject: "Homosexual Royalty"
Message-Id: <80572ABC102@PSUVM>


     I would like to begin by pointing out that since males have pretty
completely dominated Crown (and even Coronet) Tournaments in the past,
and are likely to continue to do so in the future, then same-sex royal
couples would almost certainly be male, and so if we permitted them
females would be unfairly discriminated against.  The narrow-mindedly
open-minded (meaning those who can't stand even to think of anything
that doesn't seem "perfectly" egalitarian) may stop reading right now,
as this argument should be enough to convince them.  Anyone who really
is open-minded, and isn't just trying very hard to fake it, is welcome
to read on.

     I see absolutely nothing wrong with homosexual royalty.  Probably
many if not most Kingdoms have already had both bisexual and homosexual
monarchs in the past anyway.  I'd be upset (and also surprised) if I
found that anyone had ever been prevented from ruling an SCA Kingdom
because of their sexual preference.
     But I am completely opposed to the idea that we should permit same-
sex royal couples, and I don't see that there is anything the least bit
homophobic about this.  Of course, the current policy means that people
can't reign together with their lovers, or even virtual spouses, of the
same sex, but that's beside the point.  One's "Consort" isn't supposed
to be a spouse, or a lover, or even a girlfriend - or a boyfriend.  That
is neither required nor expected anywhere in the Known World.
     As for the argument that we should allow such royal couples on
general principles, to support the right of homosexuals to have their
relationships accepted by society, that at least has the advantage of
having some basis in reality.  But I think we ought to accept the fact
that some of the things done in the SCA aren't supposed to be symbolic
of pure egalitarianism, enlightenment, or reason.  Take fighting for
example.  If SCA people really were the rabid warmongers that they so
often act like ;-) I wouldn't touch the group with an eleven-foot pole.
Similarly, our royalty aren't supposed to represent our attitudes.  If
they represent anything at all, what they represent is not attitudes but
archetypes.  And I'd rather not try to evict all the archetypes from my
head, or get them all mixed up with each other, in the name of equality.
     I simply can't buy the idea of a same-sex royal couple, no matter
how cheap it comes, ;-) and I don't see any reason why I should have to.
It seems to me like saying that equal rights for women means men can't
lead when dancing.  It's a silly, trivial complaint when compared with
real unfairness.  And before anyone tells me that women might have equal
rights if only they got to lead dances as often as they followed, I'd
like to remind people that English country dancing gives approximate
equality to both sexes/roles, and it was very popular in the seventeenth
century, which as we all know was a golden age of egalitarianism. ;-)
"Equal Rights in Dancing, and Burn the Witches!"
     In a nutshell (and I'm sure some people think I belong in one ;-) )
I think we should try to take care of the important things, such as
the right of homosexuals not to be murdered by heterosexuals, before we
try to enforce such questionable rights as the right of a homosexual
couple to be the "King" and "Queen" of an SCA Kingdom, in persona.

Subject: Help!  I'm hiding under the table!

Good fisherfolk of the Rialto, I crave your advice.  Have you ever been in this
kind of situation?  If so, what did you do about it?

By some fluke of nature, I received a Silver Crescent about a month and a half
ago.  It was quite a pleasant surprise, and I honestly wish I'd had the time
to enjoy it.  Since I'm still pretty new, I haven't yet been to an Order
meeting or received a polling letter.

I didn't have the blasted danglie more than 24 hours before my phone started
ringing.  (I'm not kidding!)  The first conversation went something like this
(my paraphrase): "Ariel old-buddy-old-pal, now that you're a Silver Crescent
you WILL nominate So-and-So, won't you?!"  Many subsequent conversations
followed the same path.  I can't go to an event without someone coming up to me
and giving the same "old-buddy-old-pal" speech.  Even in quasi-mundane 
situations people ask me, "You know that Thus-and-So deserves a Silver Crescent.
So what are YOU going to do about it?!"  Sometimes this has even happened right
in front of Thus-and-So.

My initial reaction is to hide under the table, actually, but that doesn't get
me anywhere.  The fact of the matter is, most of these people may be right.
So-and-So, Thus-and-So, What's-Her-Name, and the rest may all be well deserving
of the award, and it would be my pleasure to add one or two of the names to the
polling lists when I have the opportunity.  But the idea of being stampeded by
people, all of whom want me to champion their own personal nominees, is pretty
disquieting.  It gets so I don't want to wear the medallion to events for fear
that more people will do the "old-buddy-old-pal" routine on me.

Does this wear off after a period of time?  Or will I now have to spend the rest
of my SCA life under a table shouting, "Get outta my face!"?

     I have found that the only thing that produces a drinkable liquid 
in less than a month is a good malt liquor.  A malt liquor is simply a
honey mead that has had some malt extract (malt sugar, or maltose) added
to the must.  The addition of the malt sugar speeds fermentation (which,
incidentally, makes it much less likely that some foreign yeast or other
microbial culture can get a foothold in your mix).  If you use malt that
has been flavored with hops, you get a nicely flavored drink, which is
potable at one week, fairly good at two, and possibly quite good at
three.  This last year at Pennsic, I got a 3-week old Cinnamon Malt
Liquor approved by the Brewer's and Vintner's Guild.  Of course, it
*was* a rather exceptional batch, as far as malt liquors go, but. . .

     I measure my malt liquors by the can (I use an empty can of malt
extract, even when not using canned malt), so I can't tell you the
exact proportions of malt and honey to the water (I usually make 5 gallon
batches), but if you're interested and send me a note, I'll go figure 
it out.  Oh, and I use Montrachet wine yeast for the malt liquors, and
flavor with anything from ginger to cinnamon and cloves.  This is the
easiest way I know of to make a potable "quick drink."  If you make 
enough of it, too, it can serve to keep your hands off of the rest of
the aging "good stuff" that you've been saving for posterity, or the
next Pennsic War.

     And if you have trouble finding yeast locally, I'll mail you some.

     Greetings all gentlefolk of the Rialto, Chelidon o Gaerddrych sends
greetings and hopes of fair fortunes, unto one and all. . .

     To begin with, I would like to mention that Charles ffoulkes 
excellent book, _The armourer and his craft from the XIth to the XVIth
century_, is back in print from Dover Publications, after I believe being
out of print since 1912 or so.  The only other copies I have seen have
been 1912 editions in various libraries.  The book is an anachronist's
dream, with excerpts from period armorer's bills (the monetary kind), 
mail-making methods, barding diagrams, documents from the records of The
Armourer's Company, London (1322) and other primary sources, descriptions
of changes in armor standards in response to various historical and technical
developments (the most obvious of which being the use of gunpowder), an
excellent glossary of armor and armoring terms, etc etc etc.  Please excuse
my verbiage, I wax enthusiastic.  It's one of those books I've always wanted
my own copy of.  Now if the price of the complete facsimile copies in color
of the Book of Kells would only come down, say, a few hundred dollars. . .

     Now some comments on recent posts:

     Steffan ap Cennydd made mention some time back of the term "Spiriti
vini rectificati" as a medieval equivalent for "Everclear."  I hve recently
run across a survival of the phrase, in the form of a bottle of "Spirytus
Rectifikowany" given to me by a friend who brought it over from Poland.  And
the stuff is labeled 95% alcohol content.  Upon small tastes, it seems to
be flavored with peppercorns and mace.  Suffice it to say that it is among
the most unpleasant stuff I'v ever tasted in my life.  I know quite a few
"professional" SCA drinkers who swear this is the *only* stuff they WILL NOT
TOUCH.  It does, however, flame quite nicely, but the remaining liquid then
smells and tastes like melted plastic.  This drink was quickly christened,
"The Flaming Asshole," partially due to a bad pun on "Rectalfied Spirits,"
and partly because you'd have to be one to actually drink the stuff.  Ahem.

     My addition to the mead discussion:

     I've found that Montrachet wine yeast does a good job if you want to
produce a fairly dry (i.e., most of the sugar changed to alcohol) mead.  I
have managed to produce a sweeter mead with Montrachet, but only when making
a Black Mead (8 lbs of blackcurrants and 4lbs of honey, along with some
grapes in 2 lbs of water, with some extras), which has a great deal of
sugar in the must, or other high-sugar mixes.  The black mead turned out
very much like a good Madiera wine, slightly sweet and *very* strong.  I
get the impression that particular batch of yeasties died happy, i.e., met
with their alcohol tolerence level. . .
      A quick mead-making story, that happened about two months ago:

      I was having one of the once-monthly bardic circles over at my place,
and had made up a large bowl of wassail for the event.  Incidentally, I
had also started two batches of mead the day before.  One of the batches,
a braggart (intermediate stage between mead and ale, honey and malt, fermented
with an ale yeast), was still sitting on the stove in a covered stew pot,
with a large label, "BR02  2/18/89" stuck to the front.  Inside was my
happily-fermenting braggart, with a thick yeast-scum floating on top of the
just-barely-fermented mix.  Whilst I was in the basement, a friend of mine
who shall remain nameless to protect the guilty (but some of you might know
him as Feather), apparently thinking that this was one of the Drinks of the
Day, dipped his cup into the stuff and took a deep draught.  His comment,
along with what was apparently an indecribable facial expression, was,
"Uh, Chelidon always has such *interesting* drinks."  He did, however, take
a second cup.
     When informed about a month later what he had actually been drinking
(to explain any symptoms of bouyancy he may have been feeling as he
fermented), he laughed a bit with the rest of us, then, suddenly grew
ashen-white.  He stumbled a bit in his speech, but managed to stammer out,
"so THAT explains the doctor's diagnosis.  I TOLD her it wasn't my fault!"
You see, it seems that Feather had, not three weeks previous, been diagnosed
as having a yeast infection, and had been receiving much grief from his SO. . .

     On the subject of unusual tournaments:          

     I am not certain if this has ever been done before, but if so, I don't  
remember hearing of it.  The game is Combat Sheep Rugby, and the rules are as
follows:  fighters are divided into four clans, each clan standing at a corner
of the field, next to a clan banner.  In the middle of the field is a sheep.
(a saw-horse with a couple of 4x4s slung underneath, wrapped in sheepskin.
For you Vikings out there, the sheep  is NOT anatomically correct)  At the
signal to start, a melee begins,  with the object being to grab the sheep
(which is heavy and bulky enough to keep the carrier from using any weapons
effectively), and carry it around two poles in the middle of the field, then
back to your own clan banner.  The sheep is really too bulky to be used
effectively as a shield, so your only hope of getting it is to have your
fellow clansmen form a protective wall around you as you carry the sheep 
around the field (that, or do away with all of the opposing teams and be 
the last clan with live people on the field).  
     
     We'll be running this tourney at the Celtic Clan War and Cattle Raid
Beltaine Bash, to be held on Saturday, April 29 at the Bellefonte KOA
campground in central Pennsylvania, along with many other Celtic-theme
events, contests, etc.  For more info, check April's Pikestaff, or email
hoffman@gondor.cs.psu.edu or hoffman%psuvaxg@psuvax1.bitnet.  There.  That
takes care of my plug for the day.

     Finally, on the issue of barons and baronies:

     Before coming to the East Kingdom, I was originally involved with
The Barony of the Western Seas, in Caid (mundanely the State of Hawaii).
Barons are chosen there on a biannual basis.  Once a year, a fighter's
tournament is held, with the winning fighter being Baron or Baroness for
6 mo. On the alternate 6-month periods, an arts competition is held, with
the Baron or Baroness being selected for excellence in a series of arts
contests.  Is this such an unusual system, or is it commonly done elsewhere?
Were one looking to revamp the Kingdom Crown Tournaments (I am not), this
model might be one to examine.

     I apologise for the excessive verbiage contained within this posting,
but I have been absent for many a night due to mundane considerations.

Subject: Oppression?
Message-Id: <7877@pucc.Princeton.EDU>

My Lords and Ladies, perhaps people are being a *trifle* oversensitive
to the question of same sex consorts.  People are starting to throw
around terms like 'oppression' or 'homophob' and other such loaded
words without considering the full implications of these statements.

As far as I understand, no one is saying that homosexuals can't be
SCA, fight in tourneys, win the Crown, etc.  They may even take their
true love's favor into combat as far as I know. Or care.  The question
is: should there be same sex consorts.  A number of intelligent
reasons for a 'no' answer have been put forth.  They deserve serious
consideration and response, not deflection with words like 'oppression'
or homophobe.'

To those who think that not allowing same sex consorts is represive:
How is this any more/less represive than not allowing religious
ceremonies to be an official part of an SCA activity.  What if a
Catholic King wants to start his court with Mass or invite his
nobles to take communion?  No?  How oppressive/Catholicphobe! :)
The idea being that, while any individual SCA member can hold any
belief it wants, these beliefs should not be publicly impossed on
the SCA as a whole.  A homosexual who wants to win the Crown can do
so, nothing says the consort has to be the lover of the winner.
Therefore, disallowing same sex consorts does not prevent homosexuals
from competeing and winning crown (in this sense, the arguments are
different from the question of women doing rattan fighting).

BTW, to the gentle who posted about a Jew swearing fealty to a non-Jew.
Nothing prevents loyalty to a non-Jewish sovereign.  In fact,
"The law of the land has the force of [ritual] law" is an opperating
principle in the Talmud (except in those cases where the secular
law contradicts the Tradition, in which case Tradition takes precedence.)
Historically, what prevented Jews from swearing fealty was the Christian
nature of the Oath.  A straight pledge of secular loyalty should be kosher.

Something is keeping us from e-mailing each other. My reply to you
also bounced.

First, thanks for the mead info.  Is this Wine Shop in moped range
(about 10-15 mi)?

As to your request: My Lady, thou knowst not what thou dost!  At last
count, there were 600+ verses.  An sf-fan named John Boardman
has a complete collection, and issues a suplement every year in
the November issue of APA-Filk.  I don't have his address here,
but will give it to you at the April 15 dance event (plug! plug!).

I myself wrote an additional 15 verses for a final project in
Classical Mythology, a few of the funnier ones:

The king of gods is Zues
He'll screw anything that moves
in the form of ox or goose
bless and keep him far from me!

Let us worship Dyonisus
for his province is the nicest
red or white served over ices
and its good enogh for me

Sing a verse in praise of Pan
the horniest satyr in the land
who still gets it when he can!
so he's good enough for me.

Oh Arachne had some nerve-ah
when she challenged great Minervah
now the flies are her hors de vour-ah
bless and keep her far from me

Praise Prometheus fire giver
He gave man a burning sliver
Zeus turned him into chopped liver
and on crackers he's tasty

An apology to milord Li Kung Lo:

Milord, I most humbly beg your forgiveness. I grovel at your feet and
confess my error. Allow me to explain, please:

I quoted the term "dinosaur brain" without making any reference to who
had invented it (i.e. you). I was only using it as a general derogatory
term, because I thought it was a neat expression. I made no other reference
to your posting where you used it. I failed to see that others might make
such a connection and deduce that I was arguing against your posting, which
I was not trying to do at all.

I realize that I may have inadvertently thrown dirt in your direction.
Please alow me to wash your feet in humility and repentance whenever we
shall meet.

From:     <CRF%IFASGNV.BITNET@mitvma.mit.edu>
Subject:  Various kudos and comments

Greetings!

Firstly, I think we should all congratulate ourselves on our ability to choose
stimulating topics...  :-)

I have a number of remarks regarding the homosexuality issue (*BIG* surprise,
right?  :-) ).

Kudos definitely must go to Awilda Halfdane, and to Amanda Walker.  I thought
Amanda's posting to be one of the best things I've *ever* read in the SCA--
period.

Whether or not one agreed or dis-agreed with Paul Tien-Shih Lee, both kudos
and thanks must go to anyone who, although a mundane, cared enough to take the
time to contribute, especially as he attempted to offer an objective viewpoint
taken from a slightly different angle.

Next, I'd like to express my agreement with William de Corbie and others that
the Throne is *not* a platform for personal crusades, unless they be within
the scope of the Society and its contexts (i.e., the Crown can sound off on
the need to be more courteous any time They want to by me; that would be
appropriate).

Now comes the one bit of flame.  It's regarding Dani of the Seven Wells'
remarks in Digest #300.  Specifically:

<  "...worrying about our image is not going to help much.  And not worrying >
<  about it is not going to hurt much..."                                    >
<                                                                            >
<                     [stuff deleted]                                        >
<                                                                            >
<  "The idea of a same-sex Royal couple makes many Scadians uncomfortable for>
<  various reasons, some legitimate and some less so.  That's an important   >
<  consideration.  That it might make others uncomfortable is far less so."  >

Dani, I think you are *frightfully* wrong here!  It *DOES* matter!  It matters
every time the SCA tries to reserve a church for a revel, or a campsite
(especially those run by the YMCA or the Boy/Girl Scouts, or religious
groups).  It matters every time a minor wants to join the SCA on his/her own,
and his/her parents wonder if we're some kind of cult.  It matters every time
the media covers our activities.

In short, it matters because we must interface with Mundania, so it behooves
us to ensure that Mundania is minimally unnerved by us!  That's why I don't
support same-sex Crowns.

Finally, with respect to Jehanne l'Enragee's remarks in Digest #300:  my
attitude regarding people who won't fight a female because it's unethical, or
whatever, has been "They're entitled to their opinion, and it's *their*
decision."  I also expect them to live with their decision:  if some guy would
rather pull out of Crown Tourney than fight a female, that's *his* decision.
It's also *his* loss, and *his* problem, as far as I'm concerned.  If he wants
to turn around and bitch about it, I ain't about to listen!

Also, you are *quite* right in my opinion:  it doesn't justify excluding
people of one sort or another from any form of participation, any more than
any other of the many spurious arguments that tend to abound regarding this
sort of thing.

Enough!  On to other topics!

LANDED TITLES/GROUPS:  Regarding Henry of Maldon's reply to moi-- your points
about periodicity and historical context are well taken.  However, there would
remain the bureaucratic problems this propisition would engender.  The
simpler and more streamlined a bureaucracy, the better.  This extends to the
possibility of synonyms for a given position; the fewer the better.  In other
words, maybe Baronies, Counties, and Duchys would differ in name only and
naught else, but it would still be a pain in the RAM for the Registry!

A NOTE REGARDING MY INTERNET ADDRESS:  I am receiving mail _via_ the INTERNET
address with no problems.  Sending mail is another matter.  I don't know what
the problem(s) are, but it basically seems to boil down to general flakiness.
That, and a tendency for things to queue up for as long as several days before
going anywhere.  So:  if it's easier for a body to use my INTERNET address to
send do, by all means do.  I am going to continue to mail from my BITNET
address for the time being.

Thanks!

(The following is merely a comment and is meant for the amusement
of the populace of the Rialto only and is not to be taken seriously.)

While reading a hardcopy of goings on at the Rialto, a (female)
friend of mine remarked that if *she* won crown, she'd make
*me* her Queen. She explained "I'd want someone who could do a
decent job running the kingdom and I'd prefer it was a woman."

So how's that for a thought? What about same-sex royalty who are
*not* involved sexually? (Yeah, well. The discussion had gone far
enough anyway...)

	Hehehe... It has happened, my lady. 

(Sit back, relax for a minute, Kwellend is about to tell a story.  N key's 
optional)

	A good friend of mine made some quick mead for an event last year,
and wonderous stuff it was too.  However, he and in fellow conspiritors made
about 5 gallons of the stuff, and it wasn't all consumed at the feast, and
so the next morning they awoke to find that several bottles had survived the
night (perhaps by hidding in the darkness, who can say...)  Quick Mead being
of a... volitile nature, my friend was puzzled as to the best way to dispose
of the orphaned portions... and hit up on a marvelous method.  Taking a bottle
or so with him, he began roaming the campsite, introducing himself to gentles
and inquiring if they would like some mead for breakfast.
	Some were revolted (or at least their stomachs were, perhaps they
had had enough the night before) while others were intrigued and enjoyed 
sampling his wares.  One of the gentles that was intrigued was pleasent...
and my friend was smitten.
	Soon the gossip was flying, (a vile habit, have you any to spare?)
for it seemed that my friend was seen cavorting and flirting with another
lord from a nearby Barony.  Soon they were attending events together,
sharing tents and beds, and other acts who knew what!  The ladies in
pursuit of my friend dispaired, others wondered what he was doing, as
he had always been quite lusty with the ladies before, and now here
he was engaged in this scandlous romance.
	In time, as with most things, there came an ending.  I cannot say
what parted them, but it came to pass in time that they were not seen
together, and after a while my friend resumed his carousing with the ladies
of the shires and Baronies on the border.  The gossip mongers doubtless could
tell you more of his exploits than I, they not being limited to truth and my 
own lack of knowledge.


	The point of all this being that my friend's homosexual relationship
was entirely in persona... as the young (and remarkably clean shaven) lord
he was with was, in fact, very female in mundane life.

Subject: Heraldry question

Greetings...

   A question for the Heralds of the net:

   I have been told that persona names can be bounced if they are too similar
to already-registered names.  If this is so, then can someone utilise
variations on their registered name for secondary/tertiary personae?  (For
instance, if I wished to use "Geoffrey de Shipbrook" as a variation of my name,
would it be acceptable?)

   Also, can a secondary persona use the same device as the primary persona?

RE: The Order of the Garter:
 
The way I heard the Order of the Garter story, it was, specifically
the Countess of Salisbury who dropped her garter, and Edward I who
picked it up, saying Honi Soit Qui Mal Y Pense (Evil to him who
thinks Evil).  The garter clearly identified the Countess as a leader
in the Old Religion, and Edward, being a quick thinking sort, quickly
extended the King's protection lest the Countess get into trouble with
the (state) religious authorities.
 
The rest of what I heard coincides with Samuel Bassett's account about
the numbers in the order, etc.  The Order of the Garter is still
considered one of the most prestigious.  Winston Churchill refused a
peerage, but allowed as how he would consider a knighthood in the
Order (which he received in due course).
 
For a good supply of neat stories, try to get hold of Margaret Murray's
The Divine King in England.  (Margaret Murray was an Egyptologist who
lost her reputation when she published this book.)
 
RE: SCA Favours
 
Medieval practice has been well described
already.  To add my two cents on SCA practices, favours can be
given for several reasons including serious "I fight for your honour"
favours and friendship favours.
 
I used to give my favour to a female friend, when she was fighting,
as a sign of my support of, and confidence in her.
She was deeply involved with her lord, whose favour she also
carried next to her person at all times.  The one had nothing to do with
the other, and all parties knew that.
 
The knight in my household carries my favour.  He and his lady
offered this honour to me several years ago when I had no lord.  He wears
this with his other favours when fighting-except when he enters Crown
Tourney where he wears only the favour of his lady wife, as is proper.
One of the fighters in our household carries a favour from
me in the household colours.  I made a token for our baronial harper,
at his request.
I have, on occasion, given a token to a fighter for the duration of
a tourney, as a sign of encouragement and friendship.
(Being a Baroness provides lots of extra opportunities
for embroidery.)
 
It seems to me that the giving and receiving of favours can mean many
things.  Some of the things we call favours in the SCA might medievally
have been called something else (gifts, tokens, etc.).
The important part about SCA favours is that both the donor and the
recipient agreed on what a particular favour means.

Subject: Plays
Message-Id: <8904101058.AA04894@davids.UUCP>

I'm curious if anybody else on the Rialto is involved in putting on
plays -- especially plays from period.  Er.. wait, I *know* that
our dear Majir is involved with some thing like that .. but anyway

A group I've fallen in with is forming itself into a household whose
purpose is to do artsy type things.  So far most of what we've done
is put on a play and started practicing for a couple of others.
And it's been delightfully fun but we're kinda feeling our way
along, so to speak, and don't know quite what we're doing.  A couple
of us are trained in modern theater, but that's not quite the same.


The first play we put on was the morality play Mankind, which drew
some critical praise.  Especially from the MOA of a neighboring barony
(and her family) who loved it.  Right now we're practicing an
interlude entitled _Nice_Wanton_ which looks as if it'll be a
very fun piece to put on.  And we'll be starting on a couple of
the shorter Robin Hood plays soon.

In each we're making some changes in wording -- making it easier
for modern audiences to understand.  We're also adding little things
into the action as we see fit ... Maybe an authenticity maven would
scream at us but I feel the end effect is good...


Not sure what I'm asking after ... some contacts at least ;-)

Unto the good gentles of the Rialto
does Nicolette Bonhomme send greetings,

     First, in deference to Lady Awilda Halfdane's obvious but
brilliant suggestion, I shall speak out of persona.

     (*** Polite flame ***)  Speaking as someone raised Catholic
and who has spent a fair amount of time studying the Bible, I am
horrified to see the Bible used as a divine excuse for bigotry.
The Society' members are fairly well educated and intelligent.  I
usuaully think of the "I'm justified in my attitude because it says so
in the Bible" argument as reserved for TV evangelists marketing themselves
to Middle America.  (*** Enough said.***)

    My persona feels that these are wild and desperate times we live in.
The Holy Land is in the hands of the infidel, and her lord husband is there,
possibly never to return.  She may take a lover, but never as to interfere
with her duty as acting head of the household; this does not mean she would
love him any less.  Likewise does she feel that if the king takes a lover,
so be it.  Most likely, the lover would be assigned some attractive post in
court, and kingdom business would go on as well as it ever had.  In this
earthly world, our first priority is to the well-being of those who have
sworn fealty to us.  Personal considerations come second.


                                 In service to a world without prejudice,

Subject: Personas, Same-sex royalty, courtesy, etc...
Message-Id: <1106@lts.UUCP>

Good gentles, I'd like to start by saying "Poo-Bah!" to everyone who
has been participating in the somewhat rambling discussion about
same-sex royalty and so on.  The courtesy that has been shown by all,
even in disagreement, does the Society a lot of credit.  I think that
the clash between medieval and modern attitudes, as well the contrast
between a person and their persona, points out some important things
about how the Society. 

Saying that people and their personas are separate both is and is not
true. 

No, the Society is certainly not "real life." It's not even a
particularly accurate recreation of medieval "real life." At it's best
(which can be very fine indeed), though, it does interact with "real
life." For example, the SCA has taught me a lot over the years about
courtesy and service, which are values not often taken seriously in
the whole at large, but which I have found ways to work into my
mundane life that I wouldn't have found if it had not been for my
experience with the SCA.  My persona is not my life, but it is
nonetheless part of who I am, and thus the SCA is part of my life, and
an important one at that.  When I go to an event, there is a sense in
which I'm play-acting, but it's play-acting with serious overtones. 

Likewise, when I'm sitting at my drafting table working on a scroll in
fourteenth-century French style, I am not play-acting.  I am in fact
creating an illuminated page, and the skills (not to mention the time
and energy I have put into developing them), the time involved, and
the delight I get in seeing it presented in court are very real.
Granted, I am not a period scribe, producing period scrolls--for one
thing, I don't think period scribes sat in air-conditioned apartments
in jeans and a sweater using Winsor-Newton designer's gouache and
listening to Carmina Burana on the CD player while they illuminated
:-).  Even so, that doesn't make what I do entirely an act, either.  I
am not a fourteenth-century nun, but I am nonetheless a scribe. 

A similar thing can be said about musicians playing at a feast.  Yes,
a harp may be strung with modern strings, and may have been tuned with
an electronic tuner, but the musician does in fact play for a crowded
feast hall, but an appreciative comment from their Majesties and
table-pounding from the populace still make it all worthwhile. 

I imagine the same can be said for fighters.  I mean, nobody gets
killed (and hopefully, no one even gets hurt), but scrambling through
muddy woods in armor fighting for your kingdom is not entirely a game
in the same sense as, say, Monopoly or bridge...  The weapons and
wounds may not be real, but there's still something important
happening. 

And this, I think, is really what the Society comes down to.  We
recreate, not the Middle Ages, but those parts of the Middle Ages that
we find important, and that are missing from modern life.  The fact
that they are missing does not make them unreal.  Rather, it makes the
chance to take part in them in a friendly environment with 12,000
other people all that much more precious. 

<short pause while I wrestle this message back to its original topic>

Unfortunately, the true strength of the Society, the investment that
we make of ourselves in order to make this whole thing work, is also
one of its weaknesses.  In short, taking it seriously has its good
points and its bad points.  On the good side, the SCA could not exist
without the investment that all of us put into it.  On the bad side,
it means that our activities and our personas are a much closer
reflection of who we are than they would be if this were just a big
play, and it can be very frustrating to feel unable to express
important aspects of who we are, especially when we feel even more so
in mundane life.  This is true for pagans, homosexuals, and other
minorities, as Li Kung Lo has so graciously pointed out.  The
courtesy and tolerance in the SCA has quite a strong appeal, and
rightly so, I think, and it takes a certain willingness to flaunt
expectations to enjoy the Society in the first place.

To take a humorous example, when I went to the March for Women's Lives
in Washington DC this weekend, I half expected to see a group of
people in garb with a banner saying "Barbarians for Choice" or
something :-).  I didn't, but it wouldn't have surprised me... 

It is very frustrating to find places where this courtesy and
tolerance seem to disappear.

Sometimes it can be very hard to strike a balance between being
yourself and something that can best be summed up by "not spoiling
other people's fun." Now, things like playing the Conan soundtrack at
5:30 AM at Pennsic (to help prepare your fighters, I suppose...sigh)
is pretty clearly overstepping the bounds.  On the other hand, with
things that are not so universally accepted, such as sexual
orientation and so on, it's harder to figure out.  Personally, I tend
towards the view that the King and Queen are in part symbols of the
Crown and kingdom, and that part of the ancient symbolism we employ is
the idea that the King and Queen form complementary parts of a whole,
and that having one male and one female is a reasonable (not to
mention traditional) way to show that.  I think a same-sex royal
couple could be fun, but even I don't think it would feel quite right,
if only because there isn't even a wisp of a period framework.
However, I think there's definitely a great possibility for schtick
(another important part of the Society, when done right...) with a
King and King's Champion who were openly attached, or a Queen and
Queen's Champion (or head lady-in-waiting, or whatever).  This has in
fact been done many times with opposite-sex couples where only one of
them was royalty at the time, and it seems to work pretty well. 

Ah well, back to work.

Peace,

Amanda

Good my lord Godfrey,

You touch some interesting points here.  Basically, the College of
Arms has always tried to avoid making any rules about secondary
personae, or, indeed, about any persona.  For the most part, the
College assumes that it always is dealing with the primary persona.  A
individual may register one alternate persona name if it is submitted
with a badge for that persona, and that alternate name is judged by
the same criteria as any other name.  However, the College does not
regulate persona, or how you use your persona, or anything like that.

As it happens, the specific example you choose is moot: Since Godfrey
& Geoffrey were often used interchangably in period, the two names
Godfrey de Shipbrook and Geoffrey de Shipbrook would almost certainly
refer to the same person.  Therefore, you can confidently use either
one any way you want.  Your device is yours.  You can use it any way
you want to.

That's the official opinion.


Now my own opinions:

I find the whole idea of "official" alternate persona to be remarkably
confusing.  I can understand wanting to show up, say, Japanese, from
time to time, or wanting to create and adopt a special persona for a
particular event, but I see no reason to formalize such things.  It
just confuses people.  The fantasy of the SCA allows you to be from
any medieval culture you like, at any time.  You can wear any clothes
you want.  BUT...changing your name every other week simply makes
everyone forget who you are.

Registered names can be thought of as "official" personae.  This is
the name under which you would be called into court, or compact an
apprenticeship.  "Unofficial" personae and alternate names are just
for fun, and should generally not be taken beyond that status.

Good cheer.

Subject: Same Sex Consorts and Personas
Message-Id: <2663@lindy.Stanford.EDU>

Re:  Same sex consorts.  How quickly we degenerate into "discussing
the arguements" instead of discussing the topic.  I finally figured
out why I don't like the idea of same sex consorts:

ITS BAD THEATER!   ITS BAD THEATER!

i.e. Court is basically ad lib theatre done to entertain the masses
(and maybe actually get some useful things done at the same time).

So, is the idea, with regard to same sex consorts, that one person
"look male" and the other "look female"?  i.e. if my "persona" is
female I should "count" as a female with regard to being a consort?

Or is the idea that a fighter should be able to fight/reign for/with
anyone they please, regardless of sex?

** On a somewhat side subject to this **

As all entrants to a Crown/Principality List (and their consorts)
must be acceptable to the King/Prince, and the King/Prince may
restrict the entrants.  Go ahead and allow same sex consorts (by
mundane definition), but restrict the entrants that would be "BAD
THEATER".

i.e. if the reigning King/Prince thinks that the "same sex couple",
would (if they won) use the Throne in a manner unacceptable, then
they shouldn't be allowed to enter.  By the way, this is an
available option for other situations also.

Re:  Personas, et al.

Out here in the West, personas aren't as big a deal as in other
kingdoms (at least from what I can tell).  From experience, many
people in the West don't have personas.  They may have a "persona",
but the don't have a "Persona".

i.e. they are interested in one region/time more than another, so
they create a persona, however, they don't limit themselves in any
way based on this persona, or change their behavior.

Also, are not awards/devices/etc all registered to "your mundane,
legal entity"?  i.e. I don't care if you change your "Persona",
you're still a KSCA (or whatever).  There is no requirement that
someone ever have a persona.  Example:  Sir William the Lucky
doesn't have a persona.

If we start basing all our rules/laws/ideas/reactions, based purely
on "Personas", I change mine week to week, based on what I want to
do.  (i.e. lets be a barbarian this week so I can hassle people, and
get sick in their pavilions.  but next week lets be all courtly and
pomp and circumstance.  etc.)

Re: Same Sex Consorts
 
Such a view is probably the more unpopular, but I do support
opposite sex consorts.  The SCA is always in (productive)
tension over the Middle Ages as they were, and the Middle
Ages as they should have been.  Too much of either can make
life very unpleasant.
 
Like William, I would not have a problem with a monarch
who was gay in his/her private life. I would have a problem
with someone who used the throne as a podium for nearly any
personal belief or prejudice, and that includes Christianity,
although mundanely I am a Christian.  (Enid thinks she is
Christian, but does lots of stuff the inquisition will frown
on 700 years later).
 
I would draw my particular line for authenticity on the
monarchy.  There should be a male and a female monarch.
Otherwise we are playing some other game (ancient Sparta?).
 
Again, either monarch can be gay in his/her private life.
This is true even if some groups consider homosexuality as a sin.
If we bar what one group considers sinners, we wind up barring
adulterers, people who have had abortions,  people who
have no religious beliefs, and on and on.   I can't support
that, and it sounds like no-one else on the Rialto would
either.  I would, however,  draw
the line at having a cannibal or pederast on the throne, however,
because they harm people who have no choice or defense against
them.  (And that argument is all in John Stuart Mills.)
 
Re: The Character of the Monarch and Fealty
 
The difference between persona and person can be difficult.
Hypothetically, there are people I could not swear fealty to.
(At least one kingdom great officer was once indisposed for the length of
a reign because they could not swear fealty to the monarch).
For me, being unable to swear fealty would be based on the current
ACTIONS of the monarch as a person within and without the SCA.
 
Even though the Society is a game, and my hobby, swearing fealty
has reality beyond the game, because it draws on real tradition
and custom.  I know a couple of people who are Jewish and have
Jewish persona and do not kneel or bow to the throne.  (Standing
before the throne is as respectful as if they were saying their
prayers, after all.  Prostration is an oriental custom).
Anyone who witnessed the peerage (Pelican I believe) of
Jaelle of Armida at Pennsic a few years ago
will remember that she did not kneel, and when she
was asked if she would swear thus and so, she said "I may not
swear, but I will promise".  I really respect that way of playing,
though I also respect the decision of other Jews to take a non-Jewish
persona so that they don't have to deal with the kneeling issue.
 
Medieval Christians in the West tended to go with "one knee for
the Crown and two for God".  When circumstances have forced
me to go down on both knees-instead of one-in front of the
throne, all I can do is make a mental note that it
doesn't count.
 
Too much burbling.  I'll stop now and see if usenet will let me
post.

RE: The Order of the Garter:
 
The way I heard the Order of the Garter story, it was, specifically
the Countess of Salisbury who dropped her garter, and Edward I who
picked it up, saying Honi Soit Qui Mal Y Pense (Evil to him who
thinks Evil).  The garter clearly identified the Countess as a leader
in the Old Religion, and Edward, being a quick thinking sort, quickly
extended the King's protection lest the Countess get into trouble with
the (state) religious authorities.
 
The rest of what I heard coincides with Samuel Bassett's account about
the numbers in the order, etc.  The Order of the Garter is still
considered one of the most prestigious.  Winston Churchill refused a
peerage, but allowed as how he would consider a knighthood in the
Order (which he received in due course).

RE: SCA Favours
 
Medieval practice has been well described
already.  To add my two cents on SCA practices, favours can be
given for several reasons including serious "I fight for your honour"
favours and friendship favours.
 
I used to give my favour to a female friend, when she was fighting,
as a sign of my support of, and confidence in her.
She was deeply involved with her lord, whose favour she also
carried next to her person at all times.  The one had nothing to do with
the other, and all parties knew that.
 
The knight in my household carries my favour.  He and his lady
offered this honour to me several years ago when I had no lord.  He wears
this with his other favours when fighting-except when he enters Crown
Tourney where he wears only the favour of his lady wife, as is proper.
One of the fighters in our household carries a favour from
me in the household colours.  I made a token for our baronial harper,
at his request.
I have, on occasion, given a token to a fighter for the duration of
a tourney, as a sign of encouragement and friendship.
(Being a Baroness provides lots of extra opportunities
for embroidery.)
 
It seems to me that the giving and receiving of favours can mean many
things.  Some of the things we call favours in the SCA might medievally
have been called something else (gifts, tokens, etc.).
The important part about SCA favours is that both the donor and the
recipient agreed on what a particular favour means.

     Why shouldn't it just remain a Duchy?  Because the Duke/Duchess
doesn't live there, or because she/he/it might no longer be a "citizen"
of that Kingdom?  That's hardly a period attitude!  In period, there was
(at least in many parts of the world) no such thing as citizenship, and
it was perfectly okay to be the subject of two different Kings.  In fact,
if I'm not totally confused, the Kings of England used to do homage to
the Kings of France, because the Kings of England were also the Dukes of
Normandy.  And later on, the situation often arose that one person was
King of several different Kingdoms at once.  What mattered was not where
you were born, or where you lived, but who your parents were.
     This all changed as feudalism was replaced by capitalism, and as
wealthy merchants came to be as powerful as hereditary nobles.  Our ideas
of "citizenship," and to some extent of nationalism, reflect an urban,
bourgeois (sp???) point of view.  As any Medieval aristocrat knew, the
things that really matter are fealty and homage.
     So - what does this imply in the context of the SCA?  First, most of
us should see ourselves not as citizens of a Kingdom, but as subjects of
a King (or in some cases, of two or more Kings).  We should not worry
about such trivial matters as which kingdom we're living in.  Perhaps we
should even be allowed to hold office in more than one Kingdom, though if
an officer is going to be in a distant Kingdom for too long a time, they
should leave a deputy to take over their duties in their absence.  And,
of course, we should have nobles who have titles, and "land," in two or
more different Kingdoms.  After all, it's period. ;-)

Re William de Corbie's comments on the problems that homosexual
royal couples would present for him in terms of allegiance,
given his (particular variety of) Christian religious beliefs:

Again, this takes me back to the arguments about women being
allowed to fight.  One of the arguments that some of the male
fighters made against this was that their own ethical system
would not allow them to fight a woman, that this would mean
that they would have to refuse to fight in rounds of tourneys
where a woman would have been their u
where a woman would have been their opponent, and that they
would be unfairly disadvantaged in the Crown and other tourneys
as a result.

My position then was that people's ethical (and religious)
beliefs on matters of this sort that would involve imposing
a disadvantage on other people who did not hold those beliefs
should be the responsibility of the person holding the ethical
or religious belief.  They do not justify cutting women
or gay people off from full participation in SCA life (or mundane
society).  (People who want to discriminate against gay people
with respect to housing or jobs also frequently offer religious
beliefs as the justification for doing so.)  (Similarly, the
sort of pseudo-chivalrous beliefs about not fighting women
were often offered at that time as a basis for disadvantaging
women.)

As to the role of King and Queen as inspiration for others
in the society ... is sex really the key variable in inspiration?
Personally, I care more about what kind of person the individual
"royal" is ... courteous, or arrogant and puffed up?  Hardworking
at the requirements of a very difficult job?  Sex has very little
to do with either of these characteristics, and I have been
inspired by "royals" of both sexes who are courteous, conscientious
and hardworking, and offended by others who are on a power trip,
without regard to sex.  (I realize that the comments were
directed to a romantic ideal of chivalry ... I guess I have
never been very romantic.)

Subject: Fertility as a basis for monarchy

I am slightly stunned by Paul Tien-Shih Lee's argument that
eligibility for monarchy in the SCA (in the context of the
discussion of same sex consorts) should be based on a historical
requirement that monarchs in our period be willing to serve
as "propagator of the Realm".  This argument is flawed
on a wide range of bases.

First it assumes that gay people don't propagate themselves.
I wonder why the large number of gay people that I know with
kids got them?  Some of them had heterox

kids got them?  Some of them had heterosexual marriages
(as I suspect did a lot of medieval gay people).
It is also possible to induce pregnancy outside marriage
by occasional acts of sex.  In the modern era there is
artificial insemination, and some of the techniques in
this area would probably have worked in the middle ages
too (e.g turkey basters or their medieval equivalent).

Second, in the SCA we definitely *don't* propagate
the royal line by heridity.  If propagation is the
key variable for royalty, then we'd better change
our means of selecting monarchs pretty quickly if
authenticity is always to be the governing characteristic.
(Presumably, we picked combat tourneys as the means
of selection because it offended modern senses of fairness
and equality of opportunity for one person to be ruling
monarch in the SCA for their full life, and pass it on
to their eldest son.)

(Note also the periodic suggestions that we should
change the means of monarchical selection to let someone
other than stellar sword-fighters be ruling sovereign,
e.g. the artisans: that isn't period either, but the
issue won't be settled by period considerations.)

If propagation/fertility is to be the governing characteristic,
then we'd better adopt a lot of other new rules too.
No person who happens to be infertile should be eligible
to be monarch ... whether this is due to age, medical operation,
birth characteristics, disease that affects fertility
(e.g. hysterectomy or pelvic inflammatory disease in females)
or who has an infertile consort.  [I happen to be infertile,
by the way.]  This would be quite authentic, since nasty
things sometimes happened to monarchs without kids, especially
female consorts, but occasionally to male Kings too.
I suspect modern sensibilities would be severely offended by
this rule, however, if its target were someone other than
gay people.

I repeat that the SCA is inauthentic in an enormous range
of its practices as a reflection of the modern needs,
experiences, and values of its members.  We have never
insisted on authentic roles or personnas for black members
for example, or restricted the options of Jewish people
within the society, despite the fact that the Jews suffered
seriously from anti-semitism in our era, and there weren't
any black English Dukes, Counts or whatever.

If the oppression of gay people were as offensive to the
majority of members of the SCA as the oppression of
black people, jewish people, or female people, I'm sure
the rules we are discussing would be rapidly changed.
(There are religious values that justify the oppression
of women, jews, and black people in some religions too,
but this hasn't governed the rules adopted by the society
as a whole.)   Unfortunately, SCA consciousness is
not as tolerant to gay people at pr esent as it is to
these other groups.

Subject: persona
Message-ID:  <8904091252.aa07698@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

In recent postings people have been making a fundamental error:  They are
confusing their personas with themselves.  Personas are fictional characters,
not real people.  We are actors in a vast unscripted fantasy.  It is important
to remember that our personas would do many things that we would not.  Awilda
Halfdane is an Odin-worshipping Viking who would be quite willing to sacrifice
prisoners taken in battle to Odin.  Gwen Johnson does not even fight, and is
known for rescuing kittens.  This is true of many people--Baron Northwoods
hanged John Hobbit for starting the Squires' Revolt many years ago.
Needlesstosay, no murder was done, it was only acting.  And when we swear
fealty, or bow to monarchs, we are still only acting.  Therefore the personal
preferences of royalty don't matter, nor does the fact that the king is a real
stinker.   I respect all kings, even though I do not necessarily respect the
man who is playing king. 

It is very rare that someone's personal affairs  intrude on the fantasy in such
a way that the rest of our personas must notice.  Mind you, we the real people
notice a lot more than our personas do.  I notice that I arrive at Pennsic War
in an automobile, Awilda is convinced that she arrived by longship.  And I know
that my tent is made of nylon, Awilda knows that her tent is made of canvas.
And when King Michael the Ineffable of the Midrealm stole the royal regalia,
all the personas who were subjects of the Midrealm noticed that too.  But it
was the mundane persons who sued.  The medeival personas vowed vengeance and
dismemberment if they ever laid hands on him.  Fortunately, such incidents are
rare.

So, when we debate about the restrictions, we must remember the differences
between ourselves and our personas.  If a person is playing a Jewish persona,
regardless of whether their mundane religion allows them to swear fealty or
not, they cannot do so without violating their persona.  And if a person is
Jewish, that does not necessarily mean that his persona is.  I have known
Gentiles to play Jews, and I have known Jews to play Gentiles.  I even played a
Christian for a while, but I found I offended fewer people by being a pagan.
The difficulty was due to the fact that people assumed persona  and person were
the same.  They are not. 

So we have confused cases.  William de Corbie says he would not swear fealty to
an openly gay king.  I presume he means the openly gay persona of a king. It
is quite  possible for someone to be openly gay, but not to have an openly gay
persona.  Confusing, yes, but perfectly reasonable. We already have the really
confusing situation of SCA marriages, SCA relationships, and SCA religions. Why
not SCA sexual preferences?

Subject:  Homosexuality and discrimination

Greetings!

Firstly, a simple statement of fact:  for everyone's information, the reason
all official documents of the SCA, Inc. (_Corpora_ and Kingdom Laws) use non
gender-specific language is that mundane civil rights laws mandate it.
Gender-specific language could be used in a discriminatory manner, as a
discriminatory filter.

Ditto, women fighting.  Apart from the hard documentation that women fighters
*did* exist in period, denying women from participating in the martial arts
aspects of the Society is mundanely illegal, period.

Now:  let us face one unpleasant fact.  Discrimination against individuals on
the basis of sexual preference is, by and large, perfectly legal.  There are
places where ordinances exist to protect homosexuals from discrimination, but
these are the exception, not the rule.  I had one mundane friend who was
evicted from the apartment he had lived in for 13 years because the landlord
discovered he was gay.  The landlord was perfectly within his legal rights,
and my friend had no recourse whatsoever.

So, like it or not, homophobia remains as the one socially-acceptable, legal
form of discrimination.

This being the case, I reiterate my support of the policy of requiring the
Sovereign and Consort to be of opposing genders (please see my previous
remarks on this subject for further explanation).  **This is NOT to say I
_like_ it!**  Quite the contrary!  But, I *do* view it as a "necessary evil".

And, weak as "it isn't period" is, it's also true.

So, I don't think those clauses in _Corpora_ will change until mundane law
changes, and mandates such.  Frankly, until that time, I think we're safer
that way.

In response to William de Corbie:  I do not regard this discussion to be about
allowing the sexual preferences of a would-be Crown to intrude upon official
life, as it is about freedom to choose one's consort regardless of *anything*
other than suitability as a working partner.  The issues of homosexuality,
homophobia, etc., are relevant corollaries.

On a related point:  take it from me, when you're interested in the kinds
of things us Society-types are interested in (brewing, armors, steel toys,
costuming, history, etc.) you can be as much a misfit in the gay community as
anywhere else.  The SCA is, even now, the place I feel most accepted and most
at home.

This is an argument I'm seeing more and more often, in many contexts.

Face it:  We dress up in clothing that has been out of fashion for five or ten
centuries and get together to hit each other over the heads with pieces of
bamboo wrapped in tin foil.  Some people, somewhere, sometime, are going to
think that's weird.

They're wrong, of course, but worrying about our image is not going to help
much.  And not worrying about it is not going to hurt much.  What does hurt is
out and out obnoxious behavior, or the sort that is considered as unacceptable
within the Society as without.

The idea of a same-sex Royal couple makes many Scadians uncomfortable for
various reasons, some legitimate and some less so.  That's an important
consideration.  That it might make others uncomfortable is far less so.

Message-ID: <890409234825.14.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

A reply to Don Levey.

I may have been a little unclear, and will try to mend this.

I was trying to say that I could not serve in a reign where the throne was
used as a platform for the promotion of opinions and practices which violate
my faith. This is what would happen if there was a reign with king and consort
of the same sex, openly reigning together because they were lovers. Swearing
fealty to them would be tantamount to an open acceptance of their homosexual
relationship, which would be against my religion.

I see no problem with serving under a Jewish or Moslem king/consort, because
I do not regard it as a sin to practice Islam or Mosaic religion. I would
not, however, commit any action which would imply a denial of my own faith
and a conversion to that of the sovereign. If a Moslem king demanded that
I should bow in the direction of Mecca, I would not. 

But serving under a king of a different religion is one thing. Serving under
a king who uses his reign to propagate what I consider a sin, is another.
If the king was openly gay, that would be no problem as long as he kept
his sexual life off the throne. I might hesitate to swear *personal*
fealty to him, but I would probably serve and swear fealty to the Crown
in his reign. The Crown stands for the ideals of the SCA. The Crown does
not stand for homosexual activities. But it would come to do so if the
king and consort were lovers of the same sex.

This is my personal standpoint, and I do not try to force it on anyone
else. But it should be clear that religion is involved here, and that a
homosexual reign as described above would mean difficulties for me as a
christian.

It may well be so. It may not be the ethical ideal, but realistically
we may just have to accept the fact that it's going to cause a lot of
dissent.

The way I feel about it, the crown is won by right of arms, and as such
that person and his/her consort is the king/queen. If it were a contest
of popularity, we'd hold an election.

So I guess iwhat I'm saying is that under the current system, we pretty
much have to live with who wins the tourney. If we get same sex couple
on the crown, there will be people that don't like it, but we'll probably
learn to live with them too.

Huzzah!  Of course someone's preferences OUTSIDE the SCA has no bearing
on what they do INSIDE the SCA.  If anyone doubts that, then all you
christians outside the SCA (and jews and ...) can't swear fealty to
a pagan king.  As SCAdians we (theoretically) have no knowledge of the
mundane world activities of people as we interact with.

To further strengthen your claims, Awilda, how can any of the gentle
faiths (Christianity, Semitism, etc.) condone the battles, the killing,
etc.?  because our outside faiths don't enter it - this is all "for fun"
right?

Ahh well, I've put in my dollars worth (isn't inflation a bummer? *grin*)

[lots 'o SCA stuff which I'm in the dark about, but general sense of OK-ness
with Kings and Queens with same sex consorts, deleted]

I'm not very familiar with the SCA as it currently operates but I would
like to take a stab at this issues from a slightly diffent perspective.

It seems to me that the SCA must operate from the basis of historical
possiblity, but necessarily historical accuracy.  In fact, at least one
previous posting says as much.  If this is true, it would mean that the
domain of your activities cannot surpass certain historical, as well as
cultural boundries.  In the simplest cases, it would mean that knights
don't carry guns.  From there, you can have more and more elaborate rules
as the restrictions becomes more and more "artificial", e.g. some rule
which forbids contact between royalty and commoners.  Historically
reasonable, but silly by modern standards.

At first, the idea of Kings and Queens having opposite sex consorts does
seem to be an artifice rooted in antiquity.  However, closer examination
reveals that certain modern assumptions cannot be applied to historical or
near-historical situations.  Namely that the King/Queen and consort are
only political leaders and that these heads of state were chosen by the
Gentle Persons of a Realm from some pool of such Personages once every
several Anno.  What our modern preception fail to grasp is that the
King/Queen pair also perform the functions of social, economical, as well as
biological leaders.

The structure of any given "Realm" which has a King/Quenn type pair at the
top can almost always be distilled downed to some variation of a clan or an
extended family.  One of the most important aspects of this type of
organization is the establishment of loyalty.  Loyalty is given to the head
of the clan and the (usually) descendents, that is to say, loyalty is to
the "blood" of the leader.

If you are to assume that "blood" doesn't matter, you are then basing the
tenents of your role-playing on something other than a historically *sound*
model.  Note that accuracy is not the issue here.  It is enough to assume
certain broad, historical trends which serve as backdrops to your own
version of the past.  But the same trends which prevent Huns from using
tactical nuclear devices on the Franks (do you go back that far?) also
prevent you from simulating societies which allowed for and supported
leaders who did not consort with their opposite sex, for the simple reason
that there would be no offspring to carry on the "blood".

If you are dubious about the social impact of "normal" royalty, just look
at the English.  They are a parliamentarian democracy with the Queen as
titular head of state, who has very little real power.  And yet, I'll bet
you that if tomorrow, all sentiments of homophobia were to erase theselves
from English society, the people would still be in an uproar if both
Charles and Andrew came out of the closet and then proved that they did not
sire their children.  The issue here is the *perceived* role of a King or a
Queen as the propagator of the Realm.  If the King or Queen is unable or
unwilling because of their sexual preference to propagate their issue, the
people of the Realm cannot have great hopes for the Realm's propagation
either.

My personnal feeelings on this matter is that I could not support a monarch
who is not willing to propagate the line.  Setting this in a more
historical context, we can imagine a case where we have a monarch who
chooses a same sex consort, and my personal feelings are shared by most or
the members of Peerage.  This doesn't even have to do with homosexuality; the
same is true if the monarch is sterile.  (This is just like not betting on
a knight with no arms to win a joust.  Physical disablity is just an
explanation, there's still no percentage in it.)  The perception here is
that practicing heterosexal/child creating activities are important
qualifications in a monarch.  Without imposing some sort of extremely
elaborate and artifical external structure (see Samual R. Delaney's
Neverion stories), practicing of exclusively homosexal behavior at a public
level does not work when the people involved are Kings and Queens.

That's my two bits worth.  I would gladly welcome any further discussion on
this.  I'd really like to see how the people in this newgroup feel about
some of my generalizations.

If you do not wish to swear fealty to an openly gay King/Queen because you

The article I mentioned a few weeks ago about metallurgy and mail is
Cyril Stanley Smith, 1959. "Methods of Making Chain Mail (14th to 18th 
Centuries): A Metallographic Note".  Technology and Culture I #1 1959.

The best SCA publication I've seen on mail making is 
"The Art of Mail Making" by Sir Polidor Haraldsson (mundanely, Brian Flax).
The copy I have is not dated, but is at least six years old, so may be gone
out of print or been revised.

The Compleat Anachronist has some information on mail-making in 
"Selection from the Hammer, Part I", Compleat Anachronist 2 (September 1982).


E. Martin Burgess did some careful studies of specific mail pieces in the 
late 50's and early 60's.  I particularly like his articles:

Wlliam Reid and E. Martin Burgess "A Habergeon of Westwale" Antiquaries Journal
Volume XL Jan-April 1960

E Martin Burgess. "The mail-maker's technique"  Antiquaries Journal
XXXVIII 1953 (48--55)

E Martin Burgess. "Further Research into theConstruction of Mail Garments"
Antiquaries Journal 1953. (193--202)

E. Martin Burgess "14th Century mail hood in the Royal Scottish Museum, 
Edinburgh"  Journal of the Arms and Armor Society v2 p.59.

The mail hood looks like a particularly good project for riveted mail as it is
small, and complete details of its construction are given in the article.

Subject: mead making

The best source for mead recipes is 

The closet of the eminently learned sir Kenelm Digbie Kt opened:
whereby is discovered several ways for making of metheglin, Sider, Cherry-Wine,
&c.  together with excellent directions for cookery: 
as also for preserving, conserving, candying, &c.
(1669)

The book has been reprinted in fascimile form as volume VI of the
Mallinckrodt Collection Food Classics.  A photocopy reprint was done in
Carolingia many years ago, and may still be available.

Kenelm's recipes vary widely in strength from 18 parts water to one part honey
(in "hydromel as I made it weak for the Queen Mother") up to 2 1/2 parts
water to one part honey.  Most of his recipe use a ratio between 3 and 6 to
one.  His yeast source is either ale barm or toast (depending on the recipe).


My best mead was made with 5 lbs of honey to each gallon of water (about 2 to 
1), which made a sweet dessert wine, comparable to a good sherry.
(This mead won the brewing contest at Ice Dragon in 1984.)
Here is a short form of the recipe:
3 gallons water
16 lbs honey (Calif wildflower)
1/4 cup keemun tea
1/4 cup oolong tea
2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp whole anise seed
1 tsp crushed cardamom
20 whole allspice (crushed)
2 1/4 tsp crushed galingale root

Boil the water with the tea and spices, add the honey but do not boil it.
When cooled to 100 degrees F, add wine yeast. (I start the wine yeast in
a cup of water with a little honey added.)

Ferment for about 2 weeks (I ferment in the stainless steel pot that I boil
the water in), then siphon into a glass bottle with a fermentation
lock, leaving the sediment (tea leaves and dead yeast) behind.
Three weeks to a month later, siphon into another bottle.
Three months later siphon again.
Three months later siphon into final 750ml bottles, and store in a
cool place for a year or two.

I do not use sulphites for sterilization, but boil everything.
To sterilize a 5 gallon bottle, I fill it with boiling water and
let it stand for 15 minutes.
I've never had a batch turn to vinegar.

Some hints:
1) cleaniness is everything--sterilize anything that touches the mead.
2) the weaker the mead, the sooner it is ready.
3) use ale or beer yeasts for weak meads, white wine yeast for strong ones.
4) Adding tea for tanin is not a period practice, but helps give
character to strong meads.
5) If you don't want to wait months for the mead to clarify before bottling,
try boiling the honey with the water.  Many of Digby's recipes call
for it, and it does help coagulate the pollen proteins so they
precipitate out faster.  I think there is some loss of flavor, but if
you use commercial honey, it has already been cooked anyway.
6) Bottle in strong bottles, particularly if the mead is not quite
clear when you bottle it.  Don't wire corks onto champagne bottles
(there's less mess from poppoing corks than from exploding bottles).
7)Ferment warm and age cool. 


If you are making an ale-strength mead (say 2lbs of honey to a gallon
of water), allow 3-6 months.  If you're making a wine mead, allow 1-5 years.
If you try to hurry, you'll end up with a yeast infusion that tastes like
uncooked bread dough.

I have a more detailed recipe on making mead on mag tape.
If there is interest, I could retrieve it.  Unfortunately, it is in
TeX format, so may be difficult for people to read.

A question to the brewers of the Rialto.
We are planning a Medieval Tavern on May 4, and I would like to brew
some mead for the event.  Is there time?  Will the stuff ferment quickly
(and tastily) enough if I start, say, April 16?  Also, it is very
difficult to get yeast of any sort around here.  Is it possible to do
without?

Subject: SCA-NOTES and Homosexuality in the SCA

If I read with some cynicism the rationalizations that same-sex
royal couples should not be allowed in the SCA because "It isn't
period", it's because I'm a survivor of the "Women shouldn't be
allowed to fight because it isn't period" battles.  (My, that
dates me.)

Although those of us who wanted to fight tried to combat this
by providing period examples of women who did fight, I don't think
this is what ultimately changed the rules.

It seems likely that they were ultimately changed because this *is*
the Society for *Creative* Anachronism.  We try to replicate
constructive medieval practices, not those that were destructive
or unhealthy (e.g. smallpox, anti-semitism).\

I suspect the women-fighting rule was ultimately changed because
it offended the modern sensibilities of both female and many
male society members.

The "same sex consort" rules can be changed, and will be changed
if Society sensibilities recognize that homophobia was and is
as offensive in our own society as sexism is.

(My recollection is that at least one English King was murdered
in a particularly nasty way ... hot irons up the anus ... in
part because he was gay.  Is this a medieval value that we want
to honor?)

Subject:  Same-sex Crowns; Awards & Letters of Recommendation

Greetings!

In response to Ellen Eades' remarks regarding homophobia in the Society, and
same-sex Crowns:  firstly, there are few places as tolerant as the SCA, and I
have found none more tolerant.  I have rarely encountered homophobia in the
Society, and then only in individuals who were pretty damned uptight to begin
with (this, by the way, is coming from a New York Jew now living in the
South...).  Second:  if one stops to think about it, one can see the reasoning
behind the requirement in _Corpora_ that the Sovereign and Consort be of
different genders.  After all, there ain't no way it can be said to be period!
Moreover, it is in general safer publicity-wise, especially with some of the
recent image problems tabloid television has engendered:  like it or not,
enough people think we're wierd and suspicious as it is.  We certainly don't
need to exacerbate the situation!

Those of us who are gay, and/or feel that the prohibition of same-sex Crowns
is discriminatory, and/or that such would be harmless and a great deal of fun
besides, or whatever, may have perfectly valid points.  Unfortunately, that
doesn't make the idea of same-sex Crowns more feasible, or wiser.

With respect to Ariel of Caer Myrddin's "letter of dis-recommendation":  I
wonder, milady, if you copied your letter to the Principal or Secretary of the
polling Order in question?  You are absolutely correct in your statement that
the Crown will do as it pleases.  However, if the polling Order in question is
to make a decision on the nomination they need the same info as the Crown.  If
the Crown had this negative input and the Order didn't, mayhap they supported
the nomination.  Yes, the award is bestowed at the Crown's pleasure.   And
yes, the Crown is free to bestow the award over the Order's objections.  But
most Crowns, when faced with a negative poll (especially by a large margin),
will decline to do so:  it creates too many undesirable repercussions.

Subject: Fool's War; Various other topics

Greetings!

Well, Fool's War was a *HUGE* blast-- if the Shire of Novus Matisco is trying 
to create "Pennsic South" they're on the way!  The tri-Kingdom war was won by 
Meridies, with Trimaris second, and Atlantia third.  Trimaris fielded the most 
fighters, so Meridies and Atlantia double-teamed us in the Beach and Woods 
Battles.  Atlantia won the former battle, Meridies the latter.  Meridies won 
the three-way Bridge Battle after much time spent by all three armies thumbing 
their noses at each other from behind their shield walls.

The Arts/Sci competition was 1/3 of the points this year.  Trimaris sewed it 
up, placing first in 18 out of 28 categories (8 of those were from *my
Barony*, y'all!), let alone the second's and third's-- which explains how we 
came in ahead of Atlantia in the war, overall.

Now, on to more serious things...

LANDED TITLES:  Whereas I will gladly admit that the idea of Counties, Duchys, 
etc., is neato-spiffy-keen, I could never support its implementation; it's 
simply not practical from the standpoint of Corporate administration.  Let 
alone the spectre of (shudder!) more bureaucracy.

Consider:  your group is known as a Duchy because some Duke lives there.  
Fine.  What happens if the Duke moves?  Does the title return to that of 
Barony?  What about the Baron?  What about the Registry, and your Kingdom 
Chronicler, trying to keep track of all this?

Realistically, what we've got is the most practical set-up as far as groups'
status goes.  It also reflects what was probably the most common rank of 
nobility, apart from knight.

What is to me far more cogent is the matter of rank and resulting precedence.  
I agree with Awilda Halfdane about the titles with the highest precedence
going to those who serve, however hard they work, for extremely short,
well-defined periods of time.  I do *not* think they shouldn't get the titles;
it's not that some former King doesn't deserve the rank of Count.  I just
think that the Peers and Landed Nobility should have higher precedence,
because theirs is a contribution on a long-term scale.  So, I just wish there
was some practical way to change the Order of Precedence. But, I am fully
aware that to do so at this late date would be to result in something totally
unrelated to period practice and reality. 

Btw-- I also wish there were a practical way for non-stick types to compete 
for the Crown.

HANDICAPPED/CHIURGEON:  Both Awilda Halfdane and Li Kung Lo have addressed 
this subject most eloquently.  I think they have each said things we *all* 
need to pay attention to.  To their words, I would only add:  those 
handicapped members I have encountered strive mightily to participate and
contribute as independently as possible.  I think it behooves us all to be 
aware of their efforts, and to do what we can to smooth the way for them 
without infringing on their hard-won independence.  Which I freely admit can 
be touchy.

As an example:  here in Trimaris we have a young lady who is a very talented 
artist, and who works with the heralds on scrolls.  She is confined to a 
wheelchair.  Now, Trimaris is a *very* sandy place.  So, whenever I see this 
lady rolling off to some part of a site, I ask if she thinks she's going to 
need help getting across some soft sand.  No more; no less.  Usually, she's 
thought of a route consisting entirely of firm terra :-).  Occassionally, 
however, she does get bogged down and need assistance-- and she can usually 
anticipate the situation.  This being the case, she isn't insulted by the 
question; rather she appreciates that someone else has perceived the potential 
problem.

YEASTS:  I have found that using ale yeasts to brew meads tends to result in 
over-carbonation (can you say **BOOM!!**?).  Far better results (and in the 
case of some of the more delicately flavored honeys, better flavor) can be 
obtained using chablis yeasts.  I generally use "Montrechet," which is readily 
availably at homebrew supply stores, or by mail.

PHARISEES/SADDUCEES:  Dani of the 7 Wells made some excellent points.  There 
are many other factors which pertain to this particular situation in history, 
such as it being the period of Jewish history wherein the priesthood was 
declining, and the rabbinate growing and spreading.

All in all, I think it's best to realize that studying this period of Judaeo-
Christian history can be one's life-work; it's *that* complex.  It's also 
fascinating, and the events of this era did much to shape both Judaism and 
Christianity as we know them today (not to mention Islam...).

AWARDS/BEHAVIOR:  I'm very glad that Enid Aurelia elaborated on her situation 
further.  Not only does it jive with what many of us have been saying, it 
allows me to make one other point:  if this guy is cognizant of the
problem(s), acknowledges them, and *chooses* not to change, then:  you have 
done all you can; and *he* must now live with the consequences of his choice, 
freely made.  If he doesn't like the consequences, that's unfortunate; but it 
was, after all, *his* decision.  And, he is perfectly free to reverse it.

When a group is dealing with someone of this ilk (who refuses to change), 
oft-times only 2 courses of action remain in the end:  total ostracism; and/or 
the verbal equivalent of a boot to the head!  Enid seems to have tried the 
latter; it would appear that the only other course left to try is the 
unpleasant one of ostracism.  Frankly, if enough people refuse to talk to,
deal with, associate with, work with, or in any way acknowledge the presence 
of, this individual, he will either change or go away.  While change is of 
course preferable and to be hoped for, I can't help feeling that the loss of 
someone who so upsets people is no loss at all, no matter *how* much work 
they've done.

I know I feel just that way about one individual who recently disappeared 
after many years of much work and more problems.  The hassles just weren't 
worth the work, quite frankly.

I fully realize that what I am suggesting is not at all nice, is at best 
difficult, and may not even be feasible.  But it may be the only recourse 
left.

Thank you, one and all, for your patience with such a long posting!

Message-ID: <890408025150.7.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

Oh, well. Here we have another of those things where medieval theory and
practice conflict with modern ideology. In our modern ideology, tolerance 
is paramount and anyone who does not accept openly practiced homosexuality
is considered a "dinosaur brain" or something in that order - a bigot, a
backward conservative asshole of the First Degree.

Let me tell you about my own belief. As a Christian, I cannot accept homo-
sexual relationships as "good" in a moral sense. I would like to make it
clear that I am *not* a homophobe. I have several friends who are gay, and
though we have our differences, I do not regard them as more sinful, evil
or bad than myself. The intention of this posting is *not* to start a
debate about the ethical validity of homosexual relationships.

As a Christian I believe that God speaks through the bible. I am bound by
his words. Since the bible clearly forbids homosexual acts (not homosexual
thoughts or inclinations), I am bound by this and cannot accept such acts
as being in accordance with God's will. I consider homosexual inclination
a~ part of the damage we all suffered through the fall of mankind, and I
consider homosexual acts as sin. These sins are no worse, nor any better 
than other sins (many of which I myself commit). 

Still, it is clear to me that I could not serve or swear fealty to a king
who is an active homosexual. Active homosexuality means that the person
is saying "I am gay, and I have intercourse with people of my own sex, and
I believe that it is right to do so". Regardless of wether this king had
a consort of the same sex or inclination, I would see it as a religious
duty not to serve him/her - *not* because this person is gay, but because
he/she is saying that it is right to commit homosexual acts.

My reaction would be the same if there was a king who said he was a thief
and considered it right to steal, or if he supported any other sin that
the bible condemns. Therefore, I am very glad that the current Corpora
states that the consort shall be of the opposite sex. I realize that I
may have served kings and princes who were openly gay, but as long as
I didn't know about it, it made no difference. It would be quite a different
thing if the king used his throne as a platform for "gay liberation", making
it an obvious part of his reign that he was gay. I could not serve such
a reign.

The purpose of this posting is to illuminate the point that the sexual
inclinations of the king/queen are best kept out of the official life
of the Society. Since default is a male/female king and queen, this is
what we should have.

Message-Id: <2643@lindy.Stanford.EDU>

On this topic of same sex consorts.  Is the logic this: "That
homosexual individuals should be able to fight for their lovers"?

If so, this "implies" (but only slightly) that a fighter should only
be fighting for their lover.  Otherwise we are being inconsistent.

Or are we trying to build a case for "special consideration", but
only for homosexual individuals?  Or is the intention to let anyone
fight for members of the same sex, regardless of sexual preference?

If the arguement is to allow anyone to fight for members of the same
sex, I can't wait.  I bet I could con my Knight into fighting for
me, and I allways wanted to be Royal Peer.

[some things deleted because I agree with them... *grin*]

Milady Jehanne l'Enragee,

Though I would agree that "it isn't period" is a weak argument, I
am still of the opinion that "same sex consorts" for TRH is a bad
                                                 ^^^^^^^
thing.  "Why?" you might ask.  TRHs are theoretically almost icons
after which to pattern themselves - an inspiration to both the male
and female members of their kingdom.  A same-sex pair that eventually
wind up as King and consort or Queen and consort would deprive the
kingdom of 1/2 of their inspiration.  Yes, the consort of the King
may exhibit feminine qualities, and the consort of a Queen may
exhibit masculine qualities.  Nevertheless, they are NOT female
or male (respectively).  As a fighter, I honestly do not mind
whom inspires my opponent.  Usually I don't even know... *grin*.
In addition, I don't care whom the king or queen takes as a lover
(there's ample historical support for this as has been said),
however I DO want the titular heads of state to be opposite sex.
Oh, yes, I'd also like them to be competent at their jobs, too...

Subject: couples and crown

Unto the good gentles of the net Li Kung Lo sends greetings! In a recent
posting Ellen Eades writes:
        "I was not aware that same-sex couples were proscribed from competing
in Crown and Coronet tourneys. There *is* a fair amount of homophobia in the
Society, but fortunately little of it is institutionalized. Is this actually
true?" 
        'Tis true, milady. I believe the issue has come up before, somewhere
in the west. The language has been revised to be less sexist, referring to the
sovereign and his or her consort, rather than the king and his lady, but the
two reigning monarchs must be of a different sex. This opens up a whole lot of
questions that many people find sticky, particularly re:those who cross dress in
persona, and those who have undergone or are being prepared for sex-change
surgery. To those who think this isn't a real concern, and won't likely come
up, guess again, bucko...We know of one good gentle who is an authorized
fighter who is being prepped for male to female sex-change surgery. *He*
fights in male persona, and *she* seems to be a pacifist!
        Of course, we have the usual pack of conservatives who cannot deal
with this individual, and a few dinosaur brains who actually wish to do
him/her harm because he/she threatens them somehow. In my capacity as lady's
champion of the barony of Carolingia, I have found myself called upon to
defend *her* honor, and I'm sure *she* was thrilled! I have made it my policy
as a lady's champion that if it looks and acts like a lady, I will require no
karyotype to defend its honor. 
        This does, of course, raise the more global question of how a male or
female is to be defined in terms of crown or coronet tourneys, and who is
supposed to check? (I am certain that volunteers could be found, but in most
cases, I question their qualifications.) Please note, milady Ellen, that this
is more a historical issue than one of homophobic politics. While Edward II
was certainly an out of the closet gay man, with several public lovers,
*nobody* would have put up with it if he had tried to put one of them on the
throne of England, regardless of how high born or capable he was. A queen must
be a woman, a king must be a man, and you must have one of both! The problem
arises when the distinction between man and woman or person and persona begins
to blur. I know people who have passed as the opposite sex for fifteen years
or more without ever being detected. For all we know, we may have already had
a drag queen and never even knew it-Could be the duchess sitting next to you
right now....

In SCA #296, Rebecca the Contrary asked whether she should change the rules of
her game of chivalry to exclude those under 18.

Milady, the game sounds delightful.  You don't HAVE to exclude the 12-year-old
on the basis of her age.  What you could do is alter the rules a little so that
she (and other participants) would have to abide by them.  How about getting
one rose at a time, or something more complex?  You can make her work for the
prize and still let everyone have fun.

A note that may be of interest to those of you still beating the religious
discussion into the ground:

The latest Dover Books catalogue features some reprints of period sources.
There's a copy of The Malleus Maleficarum of Kramer and Sprenger available for
$7.50, and the Compendium Maleficarum by Francesco Maria Guazzo (1603) for
$6.95.  There are lots of other items of SCAdian interest (including a $75
reprint of Gerard's Herbal!), too.  The address is:

If you want to order any of these books right away without waiting for the
catalogue to arrive, send me mail and I'll send you the order numbers.

On using ale yeasts to brew mead:

I've had no problem yet with explosions, though it's generally a good idea to
keep the mead cold or it'll climb out of the bottle when you open it.  One
way I found around that is to add one more day onto the primary fermentation
stage (mine takes place in a covered enamel lobster pot).  The recipe I use
calls for a primary stage of 3 days, but I find that extending the ferment
to 4 or 5 days before bottling tends to reduce the likelihood of excess
pressure.

On merchanting at Pennsic:

Thanks to Ellisif Flakkingskvinne for locating the merchant autocrat for me.
If anyone else is interested, I'll post the info she sent me.

To Elizabeth Braidwood, for her reply:

Thanks, milady, for your gentle words.  I'm not sure that the same situation
applies in our case, since we're talking different Kingdoms, different Royals,
and different circumstances... but you're right.  Since I can never really
know what happened, I should probably assume the best.  (I will even restrain
myself from making some disparaging remark about IQ tests and Crown Tourneys.)

And to Elizabeth about non-peerage polling orders:

At least here in the East, such an award is based on a mixture between the
results of the poll and the discretion of the Crown.  I haven't been on the
polling lists long enough yet to know, but I've heard that the crown has some-
times made an award without first consulting the order in question, thereby
ending up on that order's shit list.  I have no facts to back this up, either,
but there might have been instances where a person might have received a number
of "yea"s in a poll but the Crown didn't bestow the award.  Most of these issues
are usually discussed in the Order meetings, and one would hope that a little
dialogue could help arrive at a decision everyone could live with.

To Arval:

This year's Puntathlon in Dragonship Haven will be September 23rd.  Be prepared
to defend your title!

I rather suspect the answer to this question depends on where you
live.  The Eastern Crown is required by law to consult the order
before giving the award.  This means that the order must be polled.
However, there is no requirement that the Crown pay any attention to
the results of the poll.  In practice, it is usually a foolish (or
very determined!) King who gives an award without the consent of the
order.

            How about a Royal Council?  Sure, there are the Ministers,
            but is there a Prime Minister? or Royal Councillor?  Someone
            who has "done this X times" or "knows what can and can't be
            done?" - If I remember right, there were Kings, and there
            were kings.  Kings ruled by their own wit, kings relied on
            someone else's wit (sometimes little more than figureheads).
            The King wouldn't be "bound" by the Council, but any King
            not considering the Council's advice would be foolhardy!

Griff & other gentles of the Net:

This sounds a lot like the East Kingdom (as I remember it) where
the curias seemed to be run as much by the officers as by the royalty.
In the West (and presumably An Tir and nearby Kingdoms) the Kings
are a lot more autocratic.

I've gotten some interesting mail on this subject, for which I thank
my correspondents.  I'd like to paraphrase one person in particular, who
said, "Yes, it's true that they're required to be members of the opposite
sex, although no one assumes that the King and Queen are lovers.  However,
it's a pity that only heterosexual couples can CHOOSE whether or not to
fight for their lovers -- homosexual couples don't have that choice."

It seems to me that the SCA has always had this dichotomy between "fun"
and "authenticity" mavens.  Having built my share of costumes, linked
my share of chain, ground my share of calligraphy paints, and cooked my
share of feasts, I've got to come down on the side of the fun mavens.
Isn't this the middle ages _as_we_would_have_liked_them_to_be?  Free of
plague, malnutrition, and illiteracy?

Gentles, I get enough flack in the modern era for my views, and all SCA
members know what it's like to stand out weird in a crowd.  It's too bad
we have to scream "Authenticity!" in order to screen out those who stand
out weird in an SCA crowd.

Greetings, Master Robyyan.

Thank you for your account of Boat Wars.  I enjoyed it.  I have heard
of this sort of melee before: Something much like was done at
Carillion about three years ago, and at Myrkfaelinn several years ago.
I don't think either event had so elaborate a scheme.  Myrkfaelinn
used movable wooden frames for boats; Carillion set up haybales to
mark the gunwales of two boats that had already grappled.  Fighters
could move from one boat to the other, but could not step outside the
haybales.

I believe that from time to time there has been some (not very
serious) discussion of trying a boat battle at Pennsic, rather along
the lines you describe.  I doubt it's practical, but boy, would it be
fun to watch!

Subject: Boat Battles

Many thanks to Robyan Torr d'Elandris for his entertaining account of the Boat
Battles...

This sort of idea came up for last years Boredom War between the Barony of
Carolingia and the Shire Quintavia (East K.) last year. It was a corsair
scenario for a fencing melee, but instead of moving boats, the two ships were
stationary with three gangplanks. Combat would have to take place on the
gangplanks only (ever try fencing on a 10-inch-wide strip, florentine or
rapier and cloak? Eeeeesh...) until one side was able to push across a
gangplank and actually board the other boat. Two victory conditions were
tried; capture-the-flag, bringing the enemy banner to one's own ship, and
capture-the-helm, which was a virtual last man standing. I seem to recall that
the "helm", a chair placed at one end of the ship, had to be taken and
defended successfully for some amount of time. That may have been only in the
practices, though...

The battles were fun, but they got started slowly, with a lot of tentative
not-quite engagement at the beginning, as advancing across the plank meant you
faced not only the other fellow on the plank but his comrades leaning over the
"rail" (a line of haybales). Waters were assumed shark-infested, so anyone who
fell off was meat for the fishies, no swimming.

Some of the rules m'lord Robyan gave may be interesting to incorporate this
Boredom War. Any thoughts, Carolingia and Quintavia?

In case it hasn't been made clear, while one's consort must be of the
opposite sex, he/she does not have to be one's spouse/lover/significant
other.  At least in Trimaris, anyway.  It is not unknown here for fighters
to choose concorts for practical or political reasons (e.g.; the missus is
pregnant in the first case or Mistress Soandso knows her way around kingdom
law better than the potential sovereign does in the second).

When I first joined the SCA, oh so many years ago, I was told that there
was a kind of difference between tokens and favors.  The man who fights for
me in crown list (or any list, I suppose) carries my favor.  Close friends
who fight for others carry my token.  I have given my favor to fighters for
the duration of a list, receiving it back (often with the tourney prize if
he won the list) after the tourney was over.  It gets complicated, I suppose.
What was once given as a favor has become a token as the gentle and I are
no longer romantically involved though the friendship still remains.  I
realize the difference is very much semantic (or is it academic...).  I've
just gotten used to the idea that he who is my champion carries my favor
and he alone.

By the by, this is one of those little things it just isn't worth arguing
over.  You see it your way, I see it mine and I'll try to remember it all
if I ever want to give you a favor/token!

I never said that "the Inquisition was a qualified court of law operating
under the same procedures as other courts of the time".

I merely pointed out that there was a great difference between the Inquisition
(in general) and the fanatic, hysteric witch-hunts of the 16th and 17th cen-
turies. The witch-hunts are often confused with the Inquisition, but are a
different phenomenon.

The Inquisition was not always the same. It existed and acted over several
hundreds of years in many different countries, and the examples of how it
worked which you quote may be true *about one place at one time*, but they
are not true about *all* of the medieval Inquisition in *all* places and at
all times. Read "Montaillou" by LeRoy Ladurie, for instance. It is based 
on the protocols of the Inquisition.

Ite Inquisition was a qualified court. That sets it apart from a witch-burning
mob of hysteric people. The Inquisition examined evidence. No doubt they
committed atrocities by modern standards. But the standard horror-image is
vastly exaggerated.

And it remains true that hose who were killed in the witch-hunts were not
pagans or witches, just plain women who had the misfortune of being accused.
Thus, they are not martyrs to the cause of witchcraft.

I don't know.  Wouldn't those among us of the Jewish persuasion consider all
Christian heretical? :-)
In any case I've been looking through my books and talking to my favorite
student of things Central American and have come up with an interesting case
of _non_-survival of a religion, nay, most of a culture, the Mayans. Unlike
most of the indigenous European religions the Mayan body of beliefs and tradi-
tions was almost completely written.  Very little of it was passed down
orally.  When the body of Mayan literature was burned by the conquistadors
(may their names and memories be erased) the vast majority of Mayan lore
was completely lost within a generation.  Judaism may have survived by virtue
of its redundant system of knowledge preservation.  If the Talmud was burned
it could (and was) reconstructed from memory (!!).  If learned rabbis were
killed the books still survived.

It's interesting. Knowledge preserved solely in one fashion is fragile.
Knowledge preserved in several media is more likely to last. It makes one
wonder what would happen should we lose the bulk of our books.  Could any
of us pas the pin test on the CRC? The pin test was/is a way of testing
Talmudic students on their knowledge.  Take a pin. Stick it through a few
pages of a volume of Talmud.  Ask the student to reconstruct the arguments,
text, and opinions contained on those pages.

There are other examples of traditions surviving the advent of Christianity
and persecution albeit not completely unchanged.  The martial arts of
the Phillipines, Okinawa, Indonesia, and to some extent Africa (among
slaves in Brazil.  I don't know anything about their survival in Africa)
continued on through centuries of suppression.  A consistently successful
tactic was to call it colorful native dancing, perfectly harmless....
The Spanish in the Phillipines and the Portugese in Brazil even encouraged
the practice.  The simple peasants danced so beautifully and seemed so
_happy_ while they were dancing.  Kepts them out of trouble.  Yup.
Does anyone know of other traditions, particularly in Europe, which survived
the Middle Ages and the Church by similar camaflogue?

On the subject of games, I mentioned bobbing for roses that happened at
out last tournament and have honestly been to busy to post the rules.

Our seneschal's lord who is not really sca wise came up with this idea.
From a not-so-local five and dime store we bought several dozen roses 
(I'm not sure how many) that were very small (about the size of a penny)
and fake.  They were given to the ladies of the day.  It was the lords'
duty to win these roses over with whatever chivalrous powers they pos-
sessed and the gentle with the most roses at the end of the day won.

We had a mute jester who gained many for his look-a-like doll, we had 
many poems written and we had many gentles aggressive for one of the first
times in a long time.  I don't remember if her highness gave up her rose
or not but several ladies preferred to keep theirs till the next year so
we have to change the color for those that like to start collections.  Two
gentles finally by combining their roses together and received the prize
for their Duke.


We had problems because the seneschal defaulted as the judge (I'd declared
myself quit by that time) and she had a hard time not giving the award to
the jester for his creativity.  These are problems to think about when creat-
ing new games.  Our last two gaming contests have been won by an industrious
12 year old who merely went around to the fighters and asked if she coudl
have their allowances since they were going to be busy fighting all day and
most heartily agreed.  It's been nice that she's won but now we have problems
wondering whether she should be allowed to win since she didn't honestly try
the gaming.  

So now, a question:  Do we change the rules and not allow anyone over 18 to
play in the gaming contest so that another person gets a chance to win or do
we leave the rules as they stand?

Subject: The Inquisition
Message-ID:  <8904042321.aa00317@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

I've been a good girl and dropped the religion subject because it's been worn
thin, but William, you got my goat with the insistance that the Inquisition was
a qualified court of law operating under the same procedures as other courts of
the time.  the Inquisition was NOT--and the jurists of the time knew it, but
excused the excesses and illegaliites of the Inquisition as a necessary evil in
order to combat the terrible horrible spector of witch craft.  I am going to
quote some originals sources as they Appear in the Encyclopedia of Witchcraft
and Demonology by Rossell Hope Robbins, published first in 1959, published most
recently by Bonanza Books of New York.  The introduction describes itself as "a
distillation of more than a thousand primary works on withcraft".   The
Encyclopedia is *the* standard reference on witchcraft.  

"A distinguished professor of law at the University of Toulouse advocates the
suspension of rules in witch trials because 'not one out of a million witches
would be accused or punished, if regular legal procedure were followed.'"
[This was in 1580, the author was Jean Bodin-Awilda]

"Trials for wichcraft were not designed to establish guilt or innocence. but to
condemn the accused as ssoon as possible."

"Any person having a mole, wen, scar or bunion is considered to possess a
devil's mark and is therefore to be executed as a witch.  A celebrated professor
of law at Cologne said that no one with such a mark could have lived a
blameless life.

"Every witch had her familiars...While imprisoned, her cell is to be watched
carefully for spiders and flies; any insect not caught is presumed to have
escaped because of its diabolical powers, thus proving the accused guilty.

"'Switzerland has been compelled to wipe out many of her villages on their
account.  Travelers in the Lorraine may see thousands of the stakes to which
witches are bound.'"

"Witchcraft was remorselessly attacked by both civil and church authorities; it
resulted in tens of thousands of people being legally murdered."

"For a century, the Inquisition attacked Waldenses and Cathari and other
heretical sects in southern France; it worked so successfully that it killed
most of the heretics and so dried up the sources of its funds.  In 1375 the
Inquisitor Eymeric lamented;"IN our days, there are no more rich heretics, so
that princes, not seeing much money in the prospect, will not  put themselves
to any expense; it is a pity that so salutory an institution as ours should be
so uncertain of its future."

[Please note that Robbins figure of "tens of thousands" is ONLY the number of
people slain for the  specific charge of witchcraft.  Many other kinds of heretics
were also burned, making a much larger total death toll.-Awilda]

"One typical set of standardized questions was used at Colmar, in Lorraine
over the three centuries of the mania:
1. How long have you been a witch?
2. Why did ypu become a witch?
22. Who are your accomplices in evil?
26. What tempests have you raised, and who helped you to produce them?"

[The total standard questions number over a hundred and are all of the "Have
you stopped beating your wife?" kind-Awilda]

"When it is remembered that the accused had to answer, that refusal was deemed
tacitunity necessitating harsher torture, that judges or torturers would prompt
the accused's memory, the uniformity of confessions is no mystery."

[The Inquisition had a standard set of questions that were so well known that
they were referred by number in the trial transcripts.  Individual cases were
rarely examined on their own merits. If a person was accused, they were
tortured until they confessed-the longest anyone ever resisted torture was
about three weeks.  In England where torture was prohibited they used sleep
deprivation, starvation, thirst, and exhaustion to obtain confessions.  Those
who confessed were strangled before being burned, those who recanted their
confessions--and many did--were burned to death.-Awilda]

"Other aspects of inquisitorial laws are just as intolerable:

1. The procedure was kept secret.

2. Common report was accepted as an indication of guilt.  In theory this
consisted of the testimony of several trustworthy persons; in practice, hearsay
gossip or denunciations given under torture.  The accused had to disprove the
rumours.

3.Frequently, precise charges were concealed from the accused.  Very
occassionally, he was allowed a lawyer appointed by the court, but the lawyer
had to take care lest he defend the accused too well and so himself be accused
of befriending a heretic.  Finally, even this pretense was a bolished.

4.Witnesses or informers were kept secret...

5.Persons normally barred from giving evidence in all other trials were
permitted and encouraged to testify in witch trials-children of ten years and
younger, perjurers and felons, and excommunicates.

6.No favorable evidence about the accused's previous life and character...

7. A witness for the accused was presumed to be a friend, and therefore guilty
by a association of the same crime.

8. Torture was always employed, nor was there any limit to its severity or
duration.  If the accused died under torture, it was said that the devil broke
his neck. Even if the accused confessed without torture,  nevertheless he had
to make his confession under torture; it was assumed that he might have
confessed falsely just to avoid torture.  After torture, the accused had to
repeat his confession "freely" and the court record would so state.

9. The most severe torture was reserved to make the accused an informer; often
names of "accomplices: were suggested to him by the judges or hangmen.

10. No one accused was ever found innocent.  At best his case would be declared
Not Proven, and the trial could be reopened at any time.  However, this was
theoretical, for in practice the accused was tortured until he confessed or
died under the torture."

"It took two hundred years to burn, at a conservative estimate, 200,000 witches....What
makes witchcraft so repellant, and morally lower than fascism, is that
throughout civilized Europe, in every country with the possible later exception
of Holland, the clergy led the prosecutions and condoned them in the name of
Christianity, while the lawyers and judges and professors abetted them in the
name of reason...Throughout the centuries, those who should, by their birth,
training, and position, been the conscience of the world, accepted the delusion
and promoted it."

[200,000 is a conservative estimate, the usual accepted figure is
1,000,000.-Awilda]

Now that I'm done quoting, I urge people to read this book.  The bulk of it is
nothing but names and dates with a bald retelling of the events.  Oftimes trial
transcripts are used to explain the case.  These are not rumours or hearsay,
these are real documented cases that actually ocurred, of people who actually
live, and all too often, died.  The Nazis are proof that massed genocide isi 
perfectly possible in a modern, rational, civilized society.  But the crime the
witches (and modern pagans) are accused of is subtler: the crime of daring to
THINK differently than the rest of the world.  Witchcraft is the only crime for
which a person can be prosecuted for what happens in the privacy of his own
head, regardless of what impact it has on the enviroment around him, even if
it is a positive impact, it doesn't matter.  The crime is the thought, not
the deed.

Subject: On boat wars and grand entrances

I enjoyed Robayyan Tour d'Elandris's description of the Boat Wars.  Two teams
of fighters did a longboat battle at Pennsic XIII, and it was a lot of fun to
watch.  (Some of my best Pennsic pictures are from that battle.)

In response to William de Corbie's account of announcing the grand entrance
of nobles in the movies: Does anybody remember the scene in Monty Python's 
"Jabberwocky" where the warden has to announce all the King's titles before 
anyone can sit down at Court?

I would assume (but will have to hit the books to come up with facts, if there
are any) that people would be announced depending on rank, and probably also
depending on how big the banquet was.  For instance, the feast at a royal
wedding would probably have more nobles present who needed to be announced
than would a banquet at a baronial hunting manor.  Did they go to the trouble
of announcing each and every one?  They may well have.  The more important the
person, the more likely a long string of titles would be attached during the
announcement.  (We moderns may not make such a big deal of this, but back then
it would have: If you had just conquered or inherited a new territory, it 
would mean something to be called "Lord of XXXX" along with everything else,
and in front of the crowd assembled.)

As for the staff-banging: We might not find any documentation for this, but I
know from experience that a herald with a staff can usually command more
attention than one without... especially after having made a few dozen
announcements.

One of the households I belong to has a custom of announcing the arrival of
guests to their camp at Pennsic, but this is the only place I see such a thing
in the SCA.  It's probably just as well, too; otherwise, East Kingdom Twelfth
Night would take 2 1/2 weeks and give laryngitis to 25 heralds.

On bowing when a lady enters the room:  I'm only guessing here, but I'll try
to check a real source (if one exists): it is possible that such a thing might
also have occurred in period, if the lady were either of high rank or were the
lady of the house.  The only precedent I can think of would be the "laws of
courtesy" that accompanied the code of courtly love.  The original premise of
the code was that men should revere all ladies as they did the Holy Virgin (of
course, this acquired more earthy connotations in practice).

I'll try to find some good sources on these customs; I suspect that period
literature might be the only place where details like this would be mentioned.

     I was not aware that same-sex couples were proscribed from competing in
     Crown and Coronet tourneys.  There *is* a fair amount of homophobia in
     the Society, but fortunately little of it is institutionalized.  Is this
     actually true?

True in the east, at any rate.  There *may* be a fair ammount of homophobia in 
the society, but this is not an instance of it.  The king and queen are 
intendend, not merely as rulers, but as symbols and archetypes: the fighter of 
chivalry, puissance, and other knightly/kingly virtues, and the consort of 
courtesy, and skill at gentle arts.  In western european culture, esp. western 
european medieval culture (which is what we're trying to recreate), a ruling 
pair is male/female.  (the warriors of classical greece were sometimes 
inspired by male lovers, see also alexander the great, if you want to start a 
classical re-creation group, feel free).

There are medieval instaces of monarchs with no consort, and rulers 
(moslem, generaly) with many.  There were several Kings of England who were 
homosexual, their wives, however, if they had them,  were female.  There were 
medieval kings who divorsed or beheaded their wives; in the SCA the ruler & 
consort are stuck with each other for the reign, and if they decide they cant 
work together, well, everyone has an interesting 6 months.

The private lives of the monarch and consort are, of course, nobodys business. 
 They are not expected or even assumed to be lovers.  (good thing too, because 
although you have to be 18+ to fight, i don't beleive there is a minium age 
for the consort)

The reason the laws say specifically 'person of opposite sex' is that they 
*used* to say 'lady'--someone (i believe visevald & embla) changed it so as to 
permit women fighters and male consorts.  The reason you have to fight for 
*somone* is not only because we are trying to re-create an idealized middle 
ages filled with romance and chivalry, but because the bozo who cannot 
persuade *anyone* to share a throne with him/her for 6 months is not a person 
one wants on the throne anyway.

anyway, the problem has not come up- as far as i know, all the openly declared 
homosexuals who have faught/been faught for have had opposite-gender consorts. 
If the situation ever does come up, there will undoubtedly be some minor hoo-ha 
for a while, and either the laws will be changed, the laws will be suspendend, 
or someone will cross-dress for a year.

Subject:  Fool's War; Various other topics

PLEASE FORGIVE ME IF THIS POSTING APPEARS TWICE.  I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT WHAT RECENT UPGRADES TO OUR MAIL SYSTEM WILL AND WON'T DO!


Greetings!

Well, Fool's War was a *HUGE* blast-- if the Shire of Novus Matisco is trying
to create "Pennsic South" they're on the way!  The tri-Kingdom war was won by
Meridies, with Trimaris second, and Atlantia third.  Trimaris fielded the most
fighters, so Meridies and Atlantia double-teamed us in the Beach and Woods
Battles.  Atlantia won the former battle, Meridies the latter.  Meridies won
the three-way Bridge Battle after much time spent by all three armies thumbing
their noses at each other from behind their shield walls.

The Arts/Sci competition was 1/3 of the points this year.  Trimaris sewed it
up, placing first in 18 out of 28 categories (8 of those were from *my
Barony*, y'all!), let alone the second's and third's-- which explains how we
came in ahead of Atlantia in the war, overall.

Now, on to more serious things...

LANDED TITLES:  Whereas I will gladly admit that the idea of Counties, Duchys,
etc., is neato-spiffy-keen, I could never support its implementation; it's
simply not practical from the standpoint of Corporate administration.  Let
alone the spectre of (shudder!) more bureaucracy.

Consider:  your group is known as a Duchy because some Duke lives there.
Fine.  What happens if the Duke moves?  Does the title return to that of
Barony?  What about the Baron?  What about the Registry, and your Kingdom
Chronicler, trying to keep track of all this?

Realistically, what we've got is the most practical set-up as far as groups'
status goes.  It also reflects what was probably the most common rank of
nobility, apart from knight.

What is to me far more cogent is the matter of rank and resulting precedence.
I agree with Awilda Halfdane about the titles with the highest precedence
going to those who serve, however hard they work, for extremely short,
well-defined periods of time.  I do *not* think they shouldn't get the titles;
it's not that some former King doesn't deserve the rank of Count.  I just
think that the Peers and Landed Nobility should have higher precedence,
because theirs is a contribution on a long-term scale.  So, I just wish there
was some practical way to change the Order of Precedence. But, I am fully
aware that to do so at this late date would be to result in something totally
unrelated to period practice and reality.

Btw-- I also wish there were a practical way for non-stick types to compete
for the Crown.

HANDICAPPED/CHIURGEON:  Both Awilda Halfdane and Li Kung Lo have addressed
this subject most eloquently.  I think they have each said things we *all*
need to pay attention to.  To their words, I would only add:  those
handicapped members I have encountered strive mightily to participate and
contribute as independently as possible.  I think it behooves us all to be
aware of their efforts, and to do what we can to smooth the way for them
without infringing on their hard-won independence.  Which I freely admit can
be touchy.

As an example:  here in Trimaris we have a young lady who is a very talented
artist, and who works with the heralds on scrolls.  She is confined to a
wheelchair.  Now, Trimaris is a *very* sandy place.  So, whenever I see this
lady rolling off to some part of a site, I ask if she thinks she's going to
need help getting across some soft sand.  No more; no less.  Usually, she's
thought of a route consisting entirely of firm terra :-).  Occassionally,
however, she does get bogged down and need assistance-- and she can usually
anticipate the situation.  This being the case, she isn't insulted by the
question; rather she appreciates that someone else has perceived the potential
problem.

YEASTS:  I have found that using ale yeasts to brew meads tends to result in
over-carbonation (can you say **BOOM!!**?).  Far better results (and in the
case of some of the more delicately flavored honeys, better flavor) can be
obtained using chablis yeasts.  I generally use "Montrechet," which is readily
availably at homebrew supply stores, or by mail.

PHARISEES/SADDUCEES:  Dani of the 7 Wells made some excellent points.  There
are many other factors which pertain to this particular situation in history,
such as it being the period of Jewish history wherein the priesthood was
declining, and the rabbinate growing and spreading.

All in all, I think it's best to realize that studying this period of Judaeo-
Christian history can be one's life-work; it's *that* complex.  It's also
fascinating, and the events of this era did much to shape both Judaism and
Christianity as we know them today (not to mention Islam...).

AWARDS/BEHAVIOR:  I'm very glad that Enid Aurelia elaborated on her situation
further.  Not only does it jive with what many of us have been saying, it
allows me to make one other point:  if this guy is cognizant of the
problem(s), acknowledges them, and *chooses* not to change, then:  you have
done all you can; and *he* must now live with the consequences of his choice,
freely made.  If he doesn't like the consequences, that's unfortunate; but it
was, after all, *his* decision.  And, he is perfectly free to reverse it.

When a group is dealing with someone of this ilk (who refuses to change),
oft-times only 2 courses of action remain in the end:  total ostracism; and/or
the verbal equivalent of a boot to the head!  Enid seems to have tried the
latter; it would appear that the only other course left to try is the
unpleasant one of ostracism.  Frankly, if enough people refuse to talk to,
deal with, associate with, work with, or in any way acknowledge the presence
of, this individual, he will either change or go away.  While change is of
course preferable and to be hoped for, I can't help feeling that the loss of
someone who so upsets people is no loss at all, no matter *how* much work
they've done.

I know I feel just that way about one individual who recently disappeared
after many years of much work and more problems.  The hassles just weren't
worth the work, quite frankly.

I fully realize that what I am suggesting is not at all nice, is at best
difficult, and may not even be feasible.  But it may be the only recourse
left.

Thank you, one and all, for your patience with such a long posting!

Subject: Ice Dragon Curse, Favors and Dis-recommendations

Just catching up on my SCAnet digests...

In Digest #291, Dagonell talks about the Ice Dragon rattan tourney:
> The winner was Master Lucan.  We're not sure if
> he falls under the Curse of the Ice Dragon or not!  [The Curse of the
> Ice Dragon - Rattan section : If you have never won Crown Tourney before,

The Shire of Seagirt (Victoria, B.C.) at their annual Daffodil Tourney
lays claim to a similar "curse": The winner of the tourney will win Crown
Tourney some time during the next year. (Acually it's not surprising.
Daffodil is one of the first tournies of the season and the top fighters
are all eager to test their skills against non-local fighters.)

In Digest #293, Awilda Halfdane talks about favors:
> Anybody can give a favor to anybody else.  It means generally that
> you like the person.  Ladies who give out favors have usually given
> favors to several people.  Men can give favors too, but I have only

Although the "Lady gives to Lord" favor is the most common here in An Tir,
I've seen many "Lord gives to Lady" favors and more than a handful of
"Lady gives to Lady" favors (these fit in the "friendship ring" category.)
I will admit that I don't remember seeing any "Lord gives to Lord" favors.

In Digest #295, Ariel of Caer Myrddin speaks about writing a letter of
opinion to the Crown concerning a less-than-reputable member of her shire.

[Hold on a sec while I put on my official Lady-in-Waiting hat...]
This posting was of particular interest to me as First Lady-in-Waiting to
Their Majesties Eirik and Meagan of An Tir. One of my jobs is to maintain a
file of yet-to-be-acted-upon recommendations that have been sent Their
Majesties, past and present. I am also usually present when TMs are
discussing awards and recipients. (An Tir is a non-polling kingdom.) I
*KNOW* that every proposed recipient is discussed and every letter
concerning that recipient is read thouroughly and carefully.

Please, Lady Ariel, do not assume that the letter wasn't even considered.
Rather assume that the letter *was* considered and then TMs took the action
that they considered appropriate based on the information that they
received. (If this happened in An Tir, I would believe that your letter
would have caused the Royalty to create a "Someone to keep an eye on"
file for your problem-person.)
[There, I can take my hat off now.]

Can somebody answer a question for me? Concerning the non-peerage polling
orders: are TMs simply soliciting information and will present the award at
their discretion - or will they present the award based only on the 'yeas'
or 'nays' received from the order?

In fact, the problem did come up, many years back, in the West, I
believe.  The BoD considered the question at that time, and the
current laws are the result of their ruling.

It is true that Corpora does not state the requirement for contiguous
groups, and it is true that Countess Aidan, the Eastern Seneschal,
stated that requirement.  However, she did not MAKE that requirement.
It is a rule which has been enforced by the BoD and the Steward for
some time.  It is their interpretation of "A well-defined territory of
geographical jurisdiction."

I had heard the story somewhat differently.  I heard the Order of the Garter
started with Edward III, who was both a very chivalrous king and a serious
womanizer (the two being compatible in those days [in fact, given the
resentment over Edward II homosexuality, the court and country were positively
*pleased* that Edward womanized]).  At a party, a Lady-in-waiting's garter
snapped off, and Edward retrieved it and returned it to the Lady.
Immediately, everyone started going 'ooh, where'd he get the garter' (in
period English/French of course).  Edward then responded with whatever the
phrase about chivalry became the motto of the Order of the Garter.

Subject: Fretting about Purple Frets

Unto Dame Enid Aurelia and all good fisherfolk, Greetings!

About the Purple Fret scenario: We had a similar thing happen in my shire a
while ago.  The person in question was harassing ladies both within and without
our shire in the name of "friendliness", and the ladies became quite sick of it.
This man had not, however, done as much for the shire as everyone thought he 
had, but  we're all in far-off Maine and nobody's near enough to find out what
the truth is.  It was alleged that he cheated on his archery scores, too, but
no one has been able to prove that conclusively.

One thing this person did do was make many friends in "high" places.  Word came
to us that he had been placed on the equivalent poll to the Purple Fret here,
and that the rest of us were being asked our opinions on this person.

The deputy seneschal and I (I was the shire herald then) sat down and wrote a
letter to the Crown, explaining what was going on in our shire.  You might call
it a letter of dis-recommendation.  We weren't trying to be spiteful or to
keep him from getting what was his due; we just wanted to inform the Crown of
what they were dealing with.  We felt that we should, as shire officers, make 
clear what was the shire's and what was his.

In short, I feel the effort was futile.  The Crown will do as it pleases, and
it may please the Crown to bestow the award anyway.  It did in this case, and
I felt that we had never been heard.  I do regret ever sending the letter
since it obviously wasn't even taken into consideration.  Letters of dis-
recommendation are pointless, and will get you nowhere, no matter how true or
how disturbing the content may be.  If in doubt, don't do it; it won't help.

Crowns may come and Crowns may go, but polling orders will go on forever.
(Royals should maybe take this into consideration sometimes...)

So sorry to bring you down --

Unto Lady Awilda and all others who read these words, greetings!

My lady, your thoughts about the system of nobility in the SCA are
good ones, and I would that we could put some of them into practice,
but I think it unlikely.  Revising the system of nobility as radically
as you suggest is impractical.  However, you make some good points.

The idea that Baronial tenure should be limited is an interesting one.
Indeed, in Atenveldt, that is the case: Landed Baroncy there is an
office, appointed by the Crown, with a two-year warrant.  I personally
do not like their scheme, but you have pointed out some of its
advantages.  Unfortunately, I believe it opens the door to abuses as
well.  However, I do find you idea that there should be some on-going
requirements for Baronial rank.  In practice, of course, there are: If
a Baron or Baroness is inactive, or acts in a way disapproved by her
people, then they may petition the Crown to remove her from office,
and to appoint a new Baron.  This does not happen too often, but the
system for complaint and redress is in place.  Any Kingdom, or even
any Barony, could institute requirements on their barons, or schedule
regular turn-over.  Such systems could model other forms of medieval
local government: Mayors of cities, Coucils of Aldermen, and so on.
After all, not every medieval city was ruled by a nobleman.

My notion of Landed Counts is essentially the same, except on a large
scale.  

	Arval.

encountered before for fighting, and I though I'd pass it along to the folk of
the Rialto to comment on and pass on to their friends.  The event was called
Boat Wars, and the concept was Vikings vs. Celts.  Nothing new so far - we've
done this before.  What made this one different was the ship-to-ship combat,
which was arranged in such a way that I consider it safe.
    Each side had boats.  The Vikings had two longboats, while the Celts had 3
coracles (we had about 24 people fighting, more or less evenly split).  The
boats were a simple 2 dimensional 2x4 frame - 4'x8' for the longboats, 4'x4'
for the coracles.
    The boats were moved by picking them up and carrying the frame.  Anyone
could pick up and move the boats, (i.e. be crew) but each boat had to have
someone on board that was "knowledgeable about boats", called a sailor.
Actually, the longboats required two sailors, since they were so large.  Any
boat without it's requisite crew of sailors was stuck in place.
    Sailors were designated people that were fighting without shields.  One of
the modifications we'll make if we do this again is designate sailors as
people fighting single sword (one broadsword, not bastard/great sword).
Sailors were needed to enable boats to move, and sailors could also "swim".
This meant that a sailor could enter the area of the field designated as water
and go wherever they wanted, although they had to do it on their knees.
    Combat from the boats was allowed, with all melee rules as usual, with one
additional rule - just prior to engagement, there was a temporary hold while
all involved put the boat frame down on the ground, then the sides engaged.
This allowed us to have the frame out of the way where it wasn't dangerous.
We weren't going to be moving around enough for them to be much of a problem
as far as tripping was concerned.  This did mean that a sideswiping hit and
run attack from a boat wasn't possible, but it didn't seem to matter.
    The tourney field was laid out with a Viking shore at one end and a Celtic
shore at the other, with an island in the middle.  Everything else was water.
In the first scenario, a flag was placed on the island, and the island was
designated to have two beaches - the rest was rock that was impossible to land
on or climb.  Both sides started on their own shore.  Victory conditions were
defined as the side that returned the flag to their own shore first.  This was
a resurrection battle.
    The next scenario had the Celts starting on the island, this time with
only one beach, and the Vikings had to take the island.  The victor was
defined as the side that had possession of the island when the last man was
standing - no resurrection.
    The third and final scenario had both sides starting on their own shore,
and the island having two beaches.  Victory was defined as possessor of the
island in 30 minutes time.  Resurrection was allowed.
    Resurrection was handled by having the dead return to their original
shore, at which point they were immediately alive, although a sailor and a
boat were needed to return them to the island where the fighting was, since
only the sailors could swim.
    The final scenario needs a slight modification to the victory conditions -
at about 23 minutes, the Celts had possession of the island and all boats,
making it impossible for the Vikings to attack the island with their freshly
resurrected fighters.  Some sailors did attempt to swim the length of the
tourney field to steal a boat, but it was really an impossibility.
    All in all, it worked surprisingly well - I'd be happy to do it again
sometime, and I'd be interested in any other thoughts on novel ways to run
melee/tournament.

Greetings!
I would like to ask the gentles on the net about medieval ways.

In motion pictures, when there is a banquet and the nobles enter,
there is often a warden at the door who announces those who enter.
Sometimes he bangs his staff on the floor for each person to enter.
Sometimes he announces each person with rank and name only (Lord
Peter Telstar and Lady Marion Sputnik), sometimes he cries out
a bundle of titles (Prince Maximus the Great, Ruler of Swampville,
Knight Commander of the Order of Mushrooms, Earl of Sopville, etc, etc).

My question is: does anybody know if this is a period custom?
Would people be announced? Would only the sovereign be announced, or
would all nobles have their names cried? Is the staff-banging period?
Were only names used or did they also announce titles ad nauseam?

In the SCA, usually only the sovereigns are announced - at least 
here in Drachenwald.

Another thing I have often seen in the American part of the SCA is
that the men rise when a woman enters the room (perhaps not at a
large banquet, but in a smaller room). All get up and bow. This 
looks very courteous and nice, but is it period? I suspect that
it's not. Enlighten me, please!

A reply to milord Cyrus Hammerhead from the indomitable William de Corbie:

Well, "impossible" is a very absolute word which I avoid lest I say something

I was not trying to glorify the Judeo-Christian interpretation of history.
I was talking about history as a science *versus* religious interpretations
of history. Approaching the material with a pre-meditated thesis and trying
to make facts fit isfalsification of history - regardless of who does it.
I was saying that the books on witchcraft that I had read were obviously
not written with a desire to be impartial and present the truth.

Those books I read were written to support religious wishful thinking. They
were not scientific, even though they tried very hard to appear so. My guess
is that since witchcraft became a fad among students, there has been a 
demand for this sort of literature, giving support to various beliefs by
giving them an air of "scientific truth". Where there is a demand, there
will be someone to fill it. There are books pro and con Christianity too,
many trying to claim scientific truth while really being misinterpretations
and falsifications. This phenomenon is not unique to witchcraft. But my
impression is that:
1. It is difficult for a lay person (non-historian) to see the difference
   between science and pseudo-science here, and
2. it is difficult to find truly scientific books on witchcraft since most
   of what you find in bookstores is the type of things that students *want*
   to read, i.e. books written to supply the demand for support of their
   new fad.

If you present a paper full f religiously biased findings at a university,
it will be revealed as such and will fail. All honest scholars are very
conscious of this, and do their utmost to avoid any such bias. When I speak
of "history" or "theology/religion" as sciences, I mean that type of academic
scholarship which is as impartial and truthful as it is possible to get. It is
the task of the historian to try and find out "wie es eigentlich gewesen ist",
in the words of a famous German theoretic.

Indeed this has been my point throughout this discussion: I am using the
results of serious, impartial research to counter what I see as wishful
thinking.

Subject: favors
Message-ID: <568625.890403.CENT@AI.AI.MIT.EDU>

Greetings to all from Lady Eowyn Eilonwy of Alewife Brook, who writes these
words in Carolingia.  I see we have found another touchy subject to discuss.

Yaakov Hamizrachi, House Nitzatzot, recently wrote:
    I have just taken up the Rattan, and would like to take my lady's
    favor into battle.  Unfortunately, neither one of us knew what one
    was, although we'd heard that this was the custom.  What exactly
    is a 'favor'?  When and how is it worn? Given? Made?

and Awilda Halfdane provided an extensive answer, which I here elaborate on
in some points:
    ...In SCA ladies usually offer favors voluntarily to men they like....
There is certainly no bar to a lord asking a lady for her favor; my
understanding is that many male fighters are simply too shy to do so.

    ...Sometimes men ask for favors -- Crown Tourney usually prompts a rash
    of favor-gifts....
Because for Crown and Coronet tourneys, each fighter is -required- to be
fighting for the honor of the gentle of the other sex with whom the fighter
intends to share his/her reign, should s/he win the tourney.  There may be
other tourneys at which each fighter is required to be wearing someone's
favor, but for the most part this courteous custom is merely encouraged.

    ...Anybody can give a favor to anybody else.  It means generally that
    you like the person.  Ladies who give out favors have usually given
    favors to several people....
Here is where we open the jar of worms.  Exactly what does a favor mean?
It means what the bearer and the giver think it means.  A favor can denote
true love, as in the case of married people or otherwise long-term couples,
or formal association, as for members of the same household, or plain
friendship.  It is perfectly reasonable for a lady to bestow her favor for
a single day of fighting, or even for a single bout, as a mark of courtesy
-- although this doesn't happen as often as it could, because ladies are
shy too.  If a lady for some reason needs her honor defended in battle, her
champion would properly wear her favor in that bout to display his
championship.  During a war between two groups, the chief lady of a group
(e.g. a Queen at Pennsic or Estrella, or a Baroness at a local-group border
war) may choose to bestow favors on all the warriors on her side.
    It is wise for the two involved to both understand what the particular
favor is intended to stand for.  If the lady thinks it's the beginning of a
beautiful friendship, and the lord merely feels improper fighting without
bearing a favor -- or the reverse -- they are going to come to grief over
this confusion.  It is entirely proper for a lady to bestow only one favor.
Those who give many usually recognize a difference between a chief favor,
which generally is worn by the lady's lord or champion, and subsidiary
favors or tokens, which are distributed to other members of her household,
friends of various degrees, or anyone else the lady chooses to so honor.

    ...Men can give favors too, but I have only ever seen it happen once.
In these parts, it is not uncommon for lords and ladies who form couples to
wear each other's favors.  This custom is particularly appropriate for
those couples in which both members fight or fence, but also pleasant
for those who merely wish to visually display their association.

As Lady Awilda noted, a favor can be anything, though the normal SCA usage
is a strip of embroidered cloth (often provided with a loop to slip the
belt through); the broidery can be anything, but is often the lady's
initial, badge, or device.  Your lady should not despair if she doesn't
embroider: one Carolingian lady for years used a plain strip of cloth
recognizable by pattern as a scrap from one of her favorite gowns; another
painted her device on one of the uppermost tiles of her lord husband's coat
of (leather) scale armor.  A favor is properly worn in any SCA event
situation, though some gentles who feel strongly about the favor-givers may
carry the favors with them always.
    In all situations it is intended to remind the bearer to concentrate
harder on comporting him/herself with honor than on merely winning, and to
remind the giver to comport her/himself so as to deserve the honor of being
fought for.  The giver of a favor may properly demand its return either at
the end of the mutually agreed period of its bestowal, or when s/he
believes the bearer has behaved dishonorably.  Similarly, the bearer may
insist on the return of the favor if s/he thinks the giver has behaved
dishonorably.  Like fealty, the obligation is mutual.

My lord Yaakov, good luck to you and your lady in this noble venture..

>Dani of the Seven Wells

My lord, first allow me to clarify my comments.  My statement was that the
Saducees went underground after the Destruction of the Second Temple in
70 ce.  The Saduccees had been heavily drawn from the Priest class,
(some scholars speculate that the name comes from the High Priest Saddok,
who was appointed High Priest in the time of Solomon.)  The Saducees
had depended heavily upon the sacrifices, not believing in prayer or any
other route to God.

As I pointed out, the similarity between Karite theology and Saducee
theology naturaly leads to specualtion that the former are a contiuation
of the later, The Saducees going underground during the oppressions
following the Destruction and recovering from the loss of their
power base.

I tend to think of the Saducees as a 'heresy' because 1) It was wrong.
(I am a Pharisee). 2) It died out. (Would people consider the Christian
Gnostics mainstream or a heresy?  How about the Aryians? The Albegensians?
Now how about the Greek Orthodox? Russian Orthodox? If you answered yes to some
and no to others, why?)

Since the Saducees came from the ranks of the aristocrats, they had
a much greater opportunity to persecute their opponents and develop
the reputation as 'bad kings' (hence it is not merely a case of the
survivors writing history, though that naturally figures into it as well.)
I recall one story in the Gemorah, although my mind fails me as to
where (I thought in Pesach, but I couldn't find it) of a Saducee king
who persecuted the Pharisees, forcing them underground.  However, as
his wife was the sister of an important Pharisee Rabbi, he occasionally
relented.  On one such occassion, he called for his brother-in-law
to lead in the Grace after Meals.  The brother-in-law, who had
consumed nothing until then, drank the wine on which he was supposed
to make the blessing. (The halachic implications of all of this are
skipped.  BTW, if anyone remembers where this story is from, please
let me know, I suspect it is either Pesachim or Brachos.)

My Lady Halfdane, I fear you miss the true purpose of a Baron.
Perhaps it is merely the fact that I was inducted into the Barony of
Carillion, but it has always seemed to me that the purpose of Barons
is to provide GREAT STORIES to tell you friends in other Baronies.
(Truth optional.)  At a recent convention I shared a room with some
folk from Charolingia and Rhode Island (I forget the Barony), and we
spent a fair amount of time swapping SCA stories.  A contest I easily
won, thanks to the prodigious doings of his Excellency Baron Pu--
Pagan Mahon.

Seriously M'lady, you can't reasonably expect somone to go to *every*
event.  Circumstances do, on occassion, intervene.  However, I agree
with your general point, that Barons should be a regular leader figure.
A question: What should the role of Barons be in Cantons or colleges
under the sponsorship of their baronies?

	The story about the Order of the Garter is essentially correct, except
that the "knight" was the King of England, and the "lady" was widely
thought to be a witch, and when he picked up the garter which she had
dropped and put it on his own leg, he turned and gave a fishy look to all
the court and said (in Norman French): Honi Soit Qui Maly y Pense (Evil
to him who thinks evil).
	If you recognize the phrase, I know what circles _you've_ been
hanging out in!

	The Order of the Garter is the most prestigious order of Chivalry
in England -- there are 12 Garter Knights for the monarch and twelve for
the Prince of Wales (when there is one), and is the pattern for many of
the Orders in the Society.

Subject: Scholarship
Message-Id: <1746@amelia.nas.nasa.gov>


	The word Wm is searching for is "scholarship", not "science" -- in
American English, "science" means Physics, Chemistry, and the disciplines
which use numbers.  The Liberal Arts -- History, Ethnography, and
Literary Criticism use an entirely different methodology -- developed and
refined in the few centuries since the Rennaisance -- to come to valid
conclusions about their areas of study.

	One of the chief techniques used by the liberal arts is to insist
that arguements be based on the study of _ORIGINAL SOURCES_ -- not
second-hand accounts of the O.S.s, not descriptions of what someone told
you about hearing someone say about them . . . etc.  The original sources
of the accounts of the "witchburnings of the Inquisition" are almost
certainly in Latin, with some perhaps in the various languages of the
time.

	I can hack my way through Latin (with a pony :-), but I certainly do
not have access to the originals (it's 5,000 miles and several $k from
here to Europe).  I cannot therefore judge the exact numbers, but the
tertiary sources I have read (scholarly histories of the Middle Ages)
agree with Wm's estimate of _thousands_, not _millions_.

	Perfectly ordinary wars in the Middle Ages killed morte people than
all of the Inquisition's idiocy -- the Rhine River actually ran red with
spilled blood several times during the 30 Years' War.  Julius Caesar
(himself a Pagan, note) killed more pagans during his conquest of Gaul
than the Inquisition ever saw people.

	That the methods of the Inquisition were cruel, capricious, and
terrible, there can be no doubt -- but so was "ordinary" justice in those
days.  Trial by torture was accepted as an ordinary technique of
jurisprudence until just about the end of our era.  Just as corporal
punishment is on the decline in the 20th Century, but increasingly common
as we look backward, so have the "accepted" means of interrogation
changed over time.  

	Elizabeth I of England had several men convicted of treason 
"Hanged, then cut down whilst still living, their bowells burnt
before their fayces, and thence drawn and quartered, and their partes
displayed in the diverse cities of England."  This was not considered
cruel and unusual punishment in the late 1500s -- it is now.

	I live in California, the Granola state (lots of fruits & nuts, but
mostly flakes), and I know several of the authors of the books mentioned.
The are not "scholars" in the sense that Wm is talking about -- they are
_polemicists_ (propagandists) for a particular outlook.  Starhawk, for
instance, makes no pretence of coming from a "long historical tradition"
of withches -- she started life as a nice Jewish girl from Brooklyn, and
has made up her "craft" as she went along.  (Her original coven was
called "Compost" :-).

	Zee Budapest is an outright radical feminist, whose attitude is that
anything done or said by men must be crap.  Her writings reflect this
attitude, much more than they reflect any "unbiased" view of what
happened in history.

	Robert Graves' scholarship is impeccable -- but he says explicitly in
"the White Goddess" that it is a work of _poetry_ and not _history_ --
I've read it two or three times.  He speaks of symbols and meanings, not
of things which happended in a concrete universe.

	That all three (and Merlin Stone, Lady Sheba, and the
not-so-anonymous author of the Gardnerian Book of Shadows) speak with the
authentic voice of a _newly-emerging_ spirit of Goddess-consciousness
cannot be denied.  The Earth, Mother Gaia, calls all of us who are open
to a new outlook (Weltanschauung, philosophy) of dealing with the
physical world and the spirit -- one more organic than logical, more
sensual than intellectual.  It is entirely appropriate to the late 20th
Century, after the terrors we have seen arise from the relentless hunger
for power.

	Bitterness, rage, and invective against the "old ways", and
deliberate distortions of fact are Hilter & Goebbels' tools for
destroying the order of the world -- they are _not_ the way of the Craft
or the Lady.  Christ talks of Karma indirectly -- "As ye sow, so also
shall ye reap" -- and almost all of the new traditions agree.  If the
cycle of bitterness and destruction is to be broken in our generation, it
is imperative that we treat each other with respect, and understand that
we, as individuals, cannot have an exclusive lock on Truth and the One
Way -- that route ends with Jim Jones in Guyana, Treblika, Auschwitz, and
the other camps, the Gulag, and ultimately with nuclear war.

	To qoute Lady Sheba's Book of Shadows:  "An' ye harm none, do as ye
will."

Unto to the folk of the Rialto:
 
Thank you for your advice concerning the Purple Fret recommendation.
I hampered the discussion to the extant that I was trying very
hard not to identify the person.
 
I find on re-reading my posting that I did not mention that
I have had several talks with this person.  The talks were
pretty frank.  On one occasion, this person (who was then a member
of the executive) was spoken to by our senior peer (a knight) and

The spouse is very well liked by the group.
 
The spouse has been talked to, and it didn't work.
 
The person and I have talked very recently, as I think I mentioned,

listened--I'm not in the habit of looking for trouble!) and have
reiterated that they have no intention of changing.
 
If I write to the Crown, and bare all, and the award is not given,
the letter will presumably stay in the files.  If a future letter

recommending the award.
 
I don't believe that awards have much to do with popularity.
It is true that people who have a habit of making enemies have
a lot of trouble getting awards, especially service awards and
peerages.  I believe that all awards, but these two in particular
take character into consideration.  Similarly, in a good company,
the people promoted to manager have a concern for people, treat
them with respect, and are adept at dealing with customers (the
equivalent of outsiders and newcomers).  Mundane companies blow
it sometimes and promote a turkey.  So does the SCA.
 
I have just realized, as I talked, that if my Barony was a company,
I would give this person meaningful and challenging work, a good
salary, and plenty of encouragement.  But, I would not give them
a promotion until the behaviour towards fellow-employees changed.

of the executive) was spoken to by our senior peer (a knight) and
myself in FRONT of the executive, and told they would have to
curb their public behaviour.  Note, I say public behaviour.

Subject: Two Performances

At the BMDL fifteenth-birthday event, the time between two of the removes was
filled in by a belly dancer.  I've been meaning to ask for some time, how much
of the belly dancing we see in the SCA is documentable.

I know that there are some period pictures showing dancers in poses
corresponding to some of the moves, but what is there beyond that?  Are the
performances we see done to period music, or to whatever sound vaguely
middle-eastern?  How much of the style is authentic?  The costumes?  etc.


There was also a martial arts display put on by Tuchux.  (A note:  Our group has
historically gotten along well with the Tuchux.  With good reason.)  In the
course of the display they gave some historical background tracing those arts,
in part, back to the Japan of 1609.  This explains much about the Tuchux that I
never understood before:  They're Cavaliers!

Unto Awilda Halfdane and all ye Fisherfolk doth Marco Palladio di Soncino send

M'lady, your posting on the origins and use of favors was quite helpful, and
the Order of the Garter story was amusing. You did however elicit one twitch
by saying that ladies who give favors, give many.

A clarification to the statement: Frequently a baroness or other noblewoman
will give a token to all fighters representing her group in battle; this is
also true of households. More commonly, though, a lady will give out a single
favor to a lord -- _her_ lord. The embroidered favor of this variety will
generally be a rendering of her device, but is sometimes some other symbol of
sentimental significance...one lord I know bears a favor with a comic-strip
thought bubble in white on blue; he and his lady have sort of a running gag
about things being caused to occur "by mere thought alone." :)

In service to the populace (and the lady whose exclusive favor I bear) I
                        remain,

Subject: Yeast
Message-Id: <89Apr3.132015edt.5456@gpu.utcs.toronto.edu>

Henry of Maldon wrote asking about beer, wine and bread
yeasts.  David le Casse's reply contains much of what I would
have said.  Since the topic fascinates me, and my specialty
is ancient domestic technology, here's my two cents worth:
 
Yeasts are airborn, but they like to live on things like
fruit skins, grains and the vessels that fruit or grains
are worked in.
 
Grapes are fermented without added
yeast in France.  Cider is fermented without added yeast
in England.  Unpasteurized honey mixed with water ferments
very nicely anywhere.
 
What cultivated yeasts do is to reproduce conditions which
exist in a particular sector of a country, with its particular
beer or wine.  Baking yeast is a cultivated descendant/variant of
a yeast that could be used for either brewing or baking.
 
I don't recommend trying cider without added yeast (I use
Lalvin champagne yeast these days) unless you can get
a proper cider apples mix, and press it yourself.  Proper
cider apples include things like Cox's Orange Pippin.  You're
looking for low acid (under 5%).
Ottawa is too far North to get the apple mix I want.
(If anyone wants to hear the whole explanation of cider making
ask me, or have a look at something like Jo Deal's book on
cider making, as a start).
 
I have made award winning mead (Aurelia Mead) from unpasteurized
honey, water, a few raisins and a little crab apple juice.
I have done the same with unpasteurized honey and cranberry
juice (a recipe which goes back to the neolithic.)
I do not add yeast, but control the environment very carefully.
Nature does the rest.
 
Wine concentrates are such that added yeast is a must (no pun intended).
If you can get hold of good local grapes (eg. Niagara, California,
New York, Texas, B.C....)
and press them yourself, by all means try without yeast.  DO NOT
add sugar or dilute with water however, as this will kill the
process (you need a sufficient concentration of the good yeast
from the grape skins, to overpower any bad yeasts.)
 
Sourdough is made from air-borne yeasts, or from a culture of
the previous batch of bread.  The Romans knew how to make a
yeast culture.  Cato gives a recipe which I have tried, for
making yeast from grape must and bran.  The New Testament
contains a reference to making bread with a piece from the
previous batch (a parable about the kingdom of heaven).  The
Egyptians originally used the same yeast for bread and beer.
Forbes thinks the yeast came from fermenting hard bread cakes
soaked in water.  (See Studies in Ancient Technology by
A. J. Forbes-it's in several volumes and in most libraries).
 
I have made bread from my brewing and vinting yeasts.  The
mead yeast is particularly good for this.  Take a cup of
mead yeast (after the second racking is best) and add a cup
of flour.  Leave in a warm place and let double in bulk.
Add another cup of flour and let it do the same.  Then
add another cup of water and about six cups of flour.  Let this
double in bulk, then add the rest of the flour, knead, and let
rise until double in bulk.  Punch down, form into loaves and
let rise at least once.  Twice will give lighter loaves.
(You may add a little fat, salt and sugar before the first
kneading, but you are not obliged to.)
 
Cider yeast is pretty good this way.  If you use beer yeast,
don't use the top yeast for ale barm, in spite of what the
old recipes say.  Use the bottom yeast from the second racking,
or your bread will be very bitter, hard and not very well-risen.
(Beer yeast has changed over the years, also, the top yeast is
too hoppy--but hops are a late (Tudor) addition).
 
Yeast lives in old bread troughs and kneading bowls, just as it
does in old wine barrels.  Once a location had a good yeast
(women were given starter cultures by their mothers when they
married), it was a good idea to keep using the same vessels
because the good yeast would be transferred.
Most of us with our modern kitchens cannot trap a good variety
of sourdough yeast.  Therefore, it is better to use
Cato's method, or to develop one from your own or a friend's
brewing.  You  can innoculate subsequent batches of beer, mead
or cider from the previous batch.  I have not tried with wine
 
As I believe David le Casse mentioned, cultivated strains of
yeast were not sold until the 1800's.
 
I highly recommend A.J. Forbes' books.  Another useful book
in Anne Wilson, Food and Drink in Great Britain.
Also feel free to experiment.  I've learned a lot from some
failed experiments!
 
Good luck

Subject: The colour pink
Message-Id: <89Apr3.132018edt.5458@gpu.utcs.toronto.edu>

Lady Malice writes about the notorious laurel dyeing story.
I heard that story too.  A friend of mine overheard this
person say that they didn't have pink- all the manuscripts
showed pink because the red had flaked off!!
 
I was so annoyed I undertook a series of practical experiments
to prove what I already knew from historical and archaeological
sources.
 
Madder produces a wide variation in shades from baby pink to
dark, brick red.  This is provided you do not ever boil the
dyepot.  Dark, brick red comes from mordanting with alum.
If you boil a madder pot, you get shades from
orange to brown.
The best madder for pink comes from the inside of the root.
 
I have documented the results of my experiments in issue 2 of
Spindle and Distaff (my occasional textile magazine), and I
have entered a knitted baby blanket which was dyed in the wool
pink with madder in Pentathlon.
 
Madder was used by the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans (see A.J.
Forbes, Studies in Ancient Technology for a start, also any
ancient textile collection).  It was forgotten in much of Europe
during the Dark Ages, and rediscovered by the 8th century and
much used until the discovery of aniline dyes in the 1800s.
Madder was one of the two components of turkey red (used on
British solidier's uniforms) The other
was cochineal.  Before cochineal was brought back by the
Spaniards in the 1500s, the Mediterranean equivalent, kermes
(a type of sea snail) was used.  Some Parmelia lichens
when fermented, give
red and purple.  Casselman (Dyeing with Lichens and Moss) discusses
this.  Hrolf Kraki's cloak was dyed with this (he was said to
be as splendid as the Emperor of Byzantium).  The Emperor's
clothes were dyed with murex.  The secret of Tyrrian purple was
so well guarded that it died with the Byzantines.  No-one has
successfully duplicated the process.  I think it must have been
related to how indigo works and if I ever get at some murex...
Tyrrian purple was actually deep red.
 
If anyone is interested in a bibliography for madder or indigo,
let me know and I'll dig it out of the archiver.
 
Speaking of pink things.  The Romans ate beetroot.  Apecius has
several recipes for it.  The early medieval people did not.
If you look at recipes like Joutes, it is clear they were eating
the leaves.  (The recipe for beet pie in Lorna Sass is wrong.)
Turnip leaves were eaten long
before the turnip roots, though there are recipes for turnip root
before there are recipes for beetroot.
 
We have several sources in the late 1500 and 1600's that indicate that
eating beetroot is a novelty.  (See Wilson, Food and Drink in
Great Britain).
 
This would seem to clinch the case for beets.
 
Enid

Re: Barons.  And appointment for life.

Founding Barons:  Yes, the title remains for life.  However, any
authority that the position has, goes away when they step down (see:
Landed Baron).

Court Baron:  Again, the title remains for life, however the
position has no authority, so it doesn't matter.

Landed Barons:  Here is the only time "appointment for life" could
matter.  As, yes, a Landed Baron is appointed for life, and has
"authority".  However, I don't see what the problem is, as the Baron
must renew his/her fealty to the King at regular intervals, and the
King can appoint someone else anytime they want.

Basically, a Landed Baron is an appointed representative of the
King.  And the King can appoint someone new anytime.

Re: Landed other stuff.

OK, which Duke do we give the Abeyance of the Westermark to?  And
what does the Baron get to say in all this?  What does the Founding
Baron get to say (since there wouldn't be a Barony to be the
Founding of)?

I don't think its a BAD idea, but I think it needs a lot more
discussion.

Subject: Chainmail, and interesting things made thereof...

In a fit of extreme boredom while visiting my parents two weeks ago, I
decided to experiment with making chainmail, following the
instructions posted here recently.  I took a couple of wire coat
hangers, and made a small piece (about 2x6 inches) in about four
hours.

I proceeded to show this to a number of my (non-SCA) friends.  One of
them was quite interested, and soon confided that, ever since seeing
one for sale at a SF con, she had really wanted a chainmail bikini.
When she found out just how little equipment was necessary to make
chainmail, she asked me to show her how to make the stuff, and I
agreed; she now wants to go ahead with making one, and I've agreed to
help out.

We know how to make chainmail "cloth"; we're now looking for any and
all hints on how to make a "successful" chainmail bikini.

Send responses to me; if there's sufficient interest, I'll post a
summary to the list.  Thanks in advance.

Subject: More on favours

In SCA Digest #292 (I think), Yaakov Hamizrachi asked about favours.

Milord: As Awilda Halfdane has said, a favour can be practically anything.  I
have seen chain mail favours, leather favours, ribbons, bits of trim, pieces
of fur (common among the Veassllurds)... anything you can attach to one's garb
or armour.  Often non-fighters receive favours from ladies (and sometimes
ladies get them from lords); it's a token of affection.

Sometimes the etiquette of favours gets strange and complex; if you've been
reading Pikestaff for a few years, you might remember that "Dear Goody" (the
sometime etiquette columnist) received more mail on this subject than any other.

Often a favour says something about the giver; the chainmail favours generally
come from talented armourers.  Some have embroidered initials, the lady's arms
or a symbol that means something to her (one costumer I know put an embroidered
pair of scissors on hers), sayings or fragments of songs or poetry... it all
depends on the meaning and on how much trouble you and your lady want to go to.

I've made four favours in my life and given away three: one to a friend, one
to an old boyfriend, one lasted longer than the romance did, and the fourth
was a piece of ribbon I'd been wearing on my circlet one day.  A lord in
armour came up to me and asked me if I might give him a favour to inspire him
in battle that day, as his lady was unable to attend the tourney.  When he
took off his helm, it turned out to be an old mundane friend of mine who had
joined the SCA without my knowing!

Ladies in the East might consider carrying bits of ribbon with them for the
duration of the next reign.  The soon-to-be-Queen has decreed that no fighter
should enter the lists uninspired.  (Of course, lady fighters should also be
thus honoured...)

Subject: Spear Shafts


Peace be upon the good Gentiles of the net.


I'm looking for the source for poltruded fiberglass for spear shafts.
I am willing to set up a large order for them (20+).  Lord Danulf told
me he thought the source was in last spring's TI, but neither of us
could turn up a copy (I think it might have been published during the
last lapse in my membership, something about the check being lost
between the post office and the registry).

Thank you in advance,

    I remember watching a television documentary series about the Vikings

 in Ireland.....I think that was the title:  "vikings in ireland'.

 In it the author and archeologist/historian, I suppose, used a bardic poem

 (or scraps of) to try and duplicate the making of the viking 'unbreakable

 sword'.  He took 7 rods of steel...twisted two pairs of rods while still

 hot from the fire...had an untempered rod in the center(for flexibility)...

 and had two rods(one on each side) prepared to take a keen edge(i know not

 how..i am not a metalsmith--perhaps tempered?)...i wanted to see more of

 this documentary...it aired on PBS  some years ago.

Subject: favors
Message-ID:  <8904021352.aa06139@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>


Favors  are tokens of a lady's favor.  They can be anything.  Historically,
knights going into a tourney would go to the lady they admired and ask her for
some token of their favor to carry with them to give them heart and keep up
their spirits.  This was usually improvised, but became rather elaborate as
time went on.  A lady asked for a favor would hand over whatever she could come
up with-a scarf, a veil, a tippet, a ring, even going so far as to rip the
sleeve off her gown.  The fighter wore it tied around his arm or tucked into
his belt.

The Order of the GArter was begun this way: a knight asked the Queen of England
for a favor.  Nothing came to hand, but then she had a bright idea.  She
reached under her skirt and pulled off her garter.  If memoroy serves, there is
an Order of the Buckle in Spain that started much the same way.  

In SCA ladies usually offer favors voluntarily to men they like.  Sometimes men
ask for favors--Crown Tourney usually prompts a rash of favor-gifts.  In the
SCA  ladies usually embroider a piece of cloth which is then worn looped
through the belt.  Some people have even gone so far as to make "battle favors"
and "court favors".  A "battle favor" is something sturdy and compact that
won't get in the way, can be easily washed, and no one's feelings will be hurt
if it gets damaged.  A "court favor" is very elaborate for use on formal
occassions.  

Anybody can give a favor to anybody else.  It means generally that you like the
person.  Ladies who give out favors have usually given favors to several
people.  Men can give favors too, but I have only ever seen it happen once.

  About tolerance: I agree! We, and deserve, high standards.
About the demographics of the SCA:   I have a sense of linked subcultures. In
particular, most SCAdians I know seem to be one or more of the following:  SCA,
Pagan folk, SF/Fantasy fannish, Gamers, ComputerJocks/Users, Comic book collec-
tors.In addition, many are in academe, and others are martial artists, although
many more people who follow those disciplines do not partake of the linked sub-
cultures.  Often, members of one interest find others through it, perhaps re-
maining identified through the original one, perhaps redefining themselves with
later exposure.  I will not go into my definition of a working subculture at
this time, although we can discuss it some other time if anyone is interested.
Actually, if I ever decided to finish my Soc/Anthro. degree, I could probably
get a thesis out of this discussion, so please don't steal if...
  Anyway, it seems to me that certain qualities are held in common between mem-
bers of these various groups.  One is creativity.  Another is the ability to
suspend disbelief (it will, too, load...). We mostly share a strong and flexible
sort of intelligence, whatever our formal education.  All of these qualities
would seem conducive to tolerance of each other's differences, as we have toler-
ance for the creations of other authors, artists, programmers, etc.
  Unfortunately, another quality many of us have in common is the experience,
prior to finding our particular entrance to the linked subculture, of being
ostracized as "different".  That, at times, can lead to defensiveness rather
than to the healthier sensitivity to others' plights and variations.  One
hopes that in time, participation in a more accepting and congenial group will
allow those who have been scarred to try again.  I don't know what those who
have been hurt within the group can do except to be patient and more tolerant
than whoever hurt them, and trust that person, too, will heal with time.

  What's wrong with that?  The Judeo-Christian faiths have been re-writing
history to suit their needs for centuries.  Try getting a hold of the

quailified?  Yep - particularly qualified at torturing people into confessions
of "sins" that were never committed.  If I put *you* on a rack for three
days and put you  through pains you cannot begin to imagine - you'd "confess"
to damn near anything to stop the pain also.  The Inquisition was about
as "fair and rational" as Hitler's Third Reich - and just as destructive.

I may be wrong but I thought that the romans had mastered the concept of
drawing wire. Admittedly, I thought that they were drawing silver and gold for
use in jewellery and costume. The techniques may not have transferred to iron
or they may have been lost, assuming they existed.

On the other hand, I remember a description of how the Vikings made their
swords. They made a number of wires, bound them into a bundle and forge 
welded them to make the sword billet. The theory being that drawing the wire
would filter out most of the impurities in the iron.

Sorry M'lord, but I should point out that the matter is not *quite* so
clear cut.  Some scholars speculate that the Karites were, in fact,
a continuation of the Sadducee heresy, a group with identical beliefs
that existed at about the time of the destruction of the Second
Temple.  (A secrete cult going underground for centuries, impossible!:)).

Furthermore, the Karaites wrote books of philosophy and interpertation,
not law.  Nor did they reject philosphy initially, their stance was
that the five books of moses represented the sole divine communication,
and through it and faith was man saved.  Any other 'laws' such as the
oral code, violated the statement of Duet xiii.1: "this is the law,
you shall not add to it, neither shall you diminish from it."

History of the Jews* Volume III and VIII.

Subject: Yeast
Message-ID: <890330160147.32.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

In response to the question from Lord Henry of Maldon about period yeast.

Yeast is a sort of fungus
Using yeast for baking bread was invented in the 18th century. Before
that, they would use sour dough to make the bread fluffy.

I talked to a microbiologist who works for the Swedish State Wine Company,
and he said something like this:

All wine and beer yeasts belong to the species "saccharomyces cerevisiae".
There are numerous subgroups of fungi within this species, and microbiologists
don't think that it's worthwhile to try and make a systematic survey of how
they are interrelated. For practical purposes, it's enough to know what they
will do to the brewing process.

Grapes naturally have a coating of wine yeast, and in the middle ages what
they did was probably that they just took the grapes, crushed them, and let
the natural process have its way. With beer, they would use a cultivated
cerevisiae fungus.

If you buy modern dried yeast, you will get a cultivated and purified
yeast, containing only one subfamily of fungi, which has been chosen for
its suitability to produce a certain kind of drink. But the fungi are
essentially the same as were used in the middle ages, they are only
safer to use because the risk of infections are reduced with modern 
methods.

I am uncertain if you can buy grapes in a shop and let them brew naturally.
It's possible that chemicals have been used (pesticides &c) that will
interfere with the yeast. But there *is* yeast on the grapes you get
in the grocer's store.

Nobody knows where the cultivated beer-yeast comes from. It's *ancient'.

Subject: Period yeasts
Message-Id: <8903310905.AA00845@davids.UUCP>

*ALL* of the wine & beer recipes I've seen from period had a phrase
saying that after you mix the ingredients together you

        cover it over with a cloth and let it sit for a few days.

There was no add-the-yeast stage, just let it sit.  And it's exactly
the thing my girlfriend told me to do when she wanted to start making
sourdough.  She told me to mix the ingredients, let it sit out for
a couple of days, and when it starts bubbling to refrigerate it.

Now, there's yeasts floating around us in the air all the time.  So
when we let something sit out it 'catches' any yeast floating around.
This is going to be some rando-yeast that just happens to be floating
by -- unless there's some reason why a particular area would be
concentrated with certain yeasts.  Like, if there's heavy winemaking
activity going on in an area the yeast population will concentrate
itself with wine yeasts.

I doubt if people in period had any idea there was any such thing
as yeast (or for that matter any other micro-organism) and wouldn't
have been able to explain why wine making worked.  Nor would they
have been able to understand why's and wherefore's of cultivating
yeast and making sure you had a pure strain and all.  Wasn't Pasteur
in the 1800's?  And wasn't he the guy who figured this stuff out?

Book: From Vines to Wines; the Complete Guide to Growing Grapes
                        & Making Your Own Wine.
Author: Jeff Cox
PBL: Garden Way Publishing
ISBN:    "88-44898 ISBN 0-88266-528-6 (pbk.)"

This printing is 1988, but it was originally published in 1985 by Harper & Row.

Weighing in at 250 pages (approx) this is an amazingly complete book.  It
contains short courses in wine appreciation (and tells you that the real
way to learn is to sign up for real courses), grape growing, and most
importantly wine making.  Each section appears complete, except in the
wine MAKING section I don't remember a section on hints to removing
off tastes.

The writing style is clear and down to earth.  He understands the needs
of a hobbyist for whom wine-making isn't their WHOLE life.  For instance
when talking about barrels for winemaking -- he goes over the exact
reasons for using them (adding "subtle oak flavors to the wine") and
a number of options for getting barrels.  Apparently the best approach
is to send off to France.  But this whole proposition is rather expensive
and besides barrels leak.  So he also talks about using oak chips in
the carboy which is apparently what *he* really does.

Very fair of him, I'd say, to cover all the bases like that even for
techniques he doesn't use himself.

And there's already been one really useful section.  One night after
helping me polish off a bottle of wine my girlfriend got to feeling
very very pained in the stomach.  This had happened once or twice
before after drinking wine and she'd heard that it had something to
do with sulfites.  I'd just bought this book so I looked up sulfites
in it to see what it had to say.

Turned out that professional wine makers use varying degrees of sulfites
and that the author could *taste* sulfites when they were in medium
levels of concentration.  The sulfites come about because of the
common practice for sterilizing wine -- adding hydrogen sulfite.  Some
people, and my girlfriend is apparently one, are overly sensitive to
sulfites and react in exactly the way she did.  Anyway, he goes over
all sorts of issues surrounding sulfites and leaves one almost afraid
to use them :-)

It's a good book and highly reccommended ...

The only lack is that he doesn't have page after page of recipe.  But he
does go over how to come up with recipes on your own.  He carefully
describes the reasons for different sugar & ph levels and how to measure
them to get best effect.

M'lord Li Kung Lo,

Forgive my fit of pique.  Things are much different now than they were back
when these things happened.  In those days a chirugeon was anybody who showed
up, said "I know first aid and I'm willing to help."  There was nobody to
complain to because there was no organization, chirugeons were Good Samaritans,
nothing more.  Some of them happened to be doctors and nurses, but there were
no such thing as warrants.  (This was  along time ago).   I know there are good
and bad chirugeons.  Being a chirugeon myself, I've met many of them.  I've
dealt with hysterics and pain and sunburn and hypothermia and more (but not as
 much as you have apparently.)  I dropped out of SCA for a while because the bad
things about it made it not worth the effort of getting myself to events.  Now
I'm back in, enjoy my new group very much, and have volunteered to become a
chirugeon for the group.  I am now going through the process of getting my
warrant (Thomas Longshanks, are you listening?)  and expect to be back on duty
by summer.

One of my favorite stories about the SCA is about chirugeons.  I was going to
an event in Avon Araf when our van broke down.  I help push it off the road,
stepped in a pothole doing it, and sprained my ankle.  When I got to the event
I sought out the Hospitallers, who were providing first aid for the event.
Aaron Black, a paramedic in mundane life, and Lady Tamara, a pagan priestess in
mundane life, were jointly providing medical services.  Lady Tamara smeared
an herbal liniment on my ankle and Aaron bound it in an ace bandage.  The two of them
took turns wagging their fingers at me and saying "Stay off your feet!"  I felt
great. Good enough in fact that when we had van trouble on the way home, I
helped push it again - and sprained my ankle again. 

Yours in medical service,

To call the Sadducees a heresy, let alone a secret cult, strongly suggests that
we haven't been reading the same histories.

One of the persistant themes of Jewish theological (I use the term imprecisely)
debate over the millenia has been the tension between relatively literal (and
relatively strict) interpretation of Jewish law and a [potentially] more
flexible interpretation.

In the period from the third century BC to the first century AD, this tension
manifested itself in a social/political/religious split into two major
factions/parties.  The Pharisees were (using these terms loosely too) religious
liberals and politically conservative.  That Saducees were religious
conservatives and more amenable to foreign contacts and ideas.  (The Saducees
tended to be upper class, which contributed to both tendencies.)  The Pharisees
won, in the sense that after the destruction of Israel as a state the parties
both disappeared, but the successors of the Pharisees went on to write the
history books.  (In Hebrew school we were taught that the monarchs who supported
the Pharisees were'good' monarchs and those who didn't weren't.  It's
interesting to me that Christians are taught history in such a way as to give
'Pharisee' a negative connotation, and that in that context the term is used to
refer to the scholars rather than to the entire faction.)

The debate about the sufficiency of the written word (versus the reliance upon
the oral tradition which became the Talmud) crops up again and again in Jewish
history.  Making any more of this link between the Kara'ites and the Sadducees
is a bit like calling the first Christians "Early Protestants".

I got it straight from Syr Hak, the Principality's Seneschal.  It contains

		College of Cor D'or
	Shire of Stormsport
	Barony of the Rhydderich Hael
		Canton of Beau Fleuve
	Barony of Thescorre
	Barony of Delftwood
	Shire of Coppertree
The groups in West Virginia overwhelmingly voted against joining the 
principality.  There may be others that I missed.

Of course, since Dani wasn't behind the scenes, he missed a few stories.
If I may ...

VIVAT TRIMARIS!  The Queen of Trimaris had reservations for Ice Dragon.
Unfortunately, she also had reservations with Eastern Airlines.  Trimaris
was not represented in Court.

ERNIE'S CITIZENSHIP  Ernie, St. Gerard's representative, busted his buns
for us, both this year and last year.  Ernie was told Baron Bedawyr wanted
to see him in the main hall.  Figuring that yet another minor glitch had
occurred with a table or a ladder or whatever, Ernie went to the main hall
and discovered that the Baron DID want to see Ernie.  In court.  In front
of 600+ people.  He froze.  A pair of lovely ladies were recruited to escort
Ernie up on stage where Bedawyr publically thanked him for all of the work
he had done for us and made him an honorary citizen of the Rhydderich Hael.
Ernie stands 5'5", but if he seemed a little taller that evening, it's because
he feet weren't quite touching the ground.

THE HOSTAGE EXCHANGE  During the reign of King Morguhn (second of that name),
Lady Seabhac received her AoA.  Lady Marion offered to do her award scroll.
Unfortunately, life interfered and the scroll didn't get done.  Later that
same reign, Lady Marion earned a Silver Crescent [EK Service Award].  Lady
Seabhac *graciously offered* to do the scroll.  It was beautiful.  It was
magnificent.  It was shown off in court.  It was given to *SEABHAC* by
King Morghun as a hostage for her own AoA.  Time passed.  At Ice Dragon,
between removes, by order of Prince Morguhn (Same song, THIRD verse) an
exchange of hostages was announced.  Lady Seabhac and her entourage (ie a
half dozen men with steel for twice their number trying to look as thug-like
as possible) took stage left.  Lady Marian and her entourage, (ie same
description) took stage right.  Two heralds were loudly given full diplomatic
immunity by both sides and they made the formal exchange in stage center.

MAYBE SOMEONE PUT IT IN THEIR FEAST GEAR?  It's two in the morning.  We're
all giddy and punchy from running Ice Dragon and the doing the clean-up.
"All set, Ernie?"  "No, there's a table missing."  "WHAT'S missing?!"
"An eight foot table, it's not here."  We spent an hour and a half looking
for a missing table.  It finally turned up locked away in a storage closet.
One of the legs was broken, so the hall janitor locked it away so we wouldn't
use it accidentally.

	All in all, it was a great event and we look forward to seeing 
everybody next year.  If chroniclers want a list of scores for their local

Greetings to all!

I am pleased to see the response to my suggestion concerning landed
counts and other new landed nobles.  In addition to the posted
replies, I have received several by mail.  I would respond to some
points. 

Lord Hal Ravn suggests:

> Of course, this means there should be Landed Viscounts and Dukes as

I would recommend against this route (or were you joking?).  If we
allow one title to be used as a landed one, we could certanly allow
them all, by Royal choice, but I think it would be best to restrict it
to one or two choices.  Otherwise, people are BOUND to get annoyed.

> I haven't a clue what the Royal Peers will say.  Would you like me
> to ask a few of the Western ones?

Sure, why not?  I'd be interested in any responses.  thanks.



Lord Harabanar Hugilaikir says:

This is an interesting notion, my lord, but I would much rather see a
more truly feudal system, rather than just re-naming what we already
have.  It's well worth keeping in mind, though...

Lady Gwdiauwen ferch Gwdolwyn cries:

> The opportunities for bureaucratic growth in an already

> But then, I'm just one of those obstreperous Myrkfaelinn anarchists....

As an old Myrkfaelinnite myself, I well understand the urge to avoid
bureaucracy.  My notion, however, would create no new bureaucracy,
because counties, duchies, marks, and whatever would not be official
branches of the SCA.  Thee is no particular reason that the feudal
structure of the Society should correspond to the bureaucratic
structure.  Landed Counts and so on would be Crown appointments, but
would have no need of officers, or any of that stuff.  They would be
purely ceremonial, not administrative.  Thus, this route is the
perfect answer to groups which would like to get together and make a
principality, but don:t want to have to deal with another annoying
layer of officers.  It could also seve as an elegant intermediate step
between wholly-unofficial-regional-organization and formal
principality status.


Several gentles have suggested more complex chains of fealty in the
SCA, most of them constructed by pegging together independent chains
of fealty: For example, what if a knight is also a Baron, and one of
his squires is a Laurel and has apprentices, one of whom in a
guildmaster, who....  Indeed, such things exist in the Society, but I
think my original point stands: We are missing the true intent of
feudal fealty, and it would be good to create a way to obtain it.  

Thanks for the ideas, everyone!

	Arval.

Subject: Landed nobility,land, and nobles
Message-ID:  <8903311752.aa20507@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

Landed counts?  Well, why not?  I've been musing onthis subject for a while now
as I work on my maps.  I've noticed osme things about the way we do business in
the SCA and I'm going to share my thoughts with the rest of you.

We have only two kinds of landed nobility in the SCA:barons and royalty.
Barons are Appointed Forever, kings, queens, and princes serve only six months.
If you get an "inadequate" monarch, the damage he can do is limited byhis short
reign. An inadequate baron is forever.  I have never heard of a baron being
deprived of his ofice, though I suppose a king could do that if he felt it
necessary.  The only way a baron is normally removed is for him to resign.

  And
some of the barons, while being perfectly nice people, don't really fulfill
their duties as baron.  They've been baron forever, the novelty has worn off,
they're no longer active,  once in a while they show up at events, ask for
reccommendations, and then hand out a bunch of baronial service awards to
people they've never even met.  I don't know if there is a rule requiring
barons to bve members in good standing, but if there isn't, there should be.
If a baron can't even get it togehter enough to send in his subscription then
the people could get a new baron who would take an active leadership role in
the group.  A baron ought to attend all events in his barony, show up regularly
for meetings, fighter practice, guild meetings, and whateveer other activities
his barony sponsors.  If he can't do this on a regular basis, he shouldn't be
baron, and his resignation is in order.

I personally favor putting a time limit, say two years, on a landed baron. If
he's been a great baron, the Crown can reappoint him.  If not, the Crown can
pick somebody who's going to be more active.  Or maybe the members of the
group ought ought pick their own baron, they have to live with him after all.
Baronial Tourney?  Nah, stickjocks have too much influence already.  Barons
ought to be well rounded and knowledgeable about all aspects of the SCA... An
arts pentathalon perhaps?  And if groups wante dto join together into a larger
alliance, they could form countied or cushies with someone of their choosing at
the head.  That person would then have to be confirmed in his rank and holdings
by the monarch.  That is how it was done in period.  

Of course, the monarchs would have to have  the right to make peers of that
rank.  After all monarchs in period bestowed rank and titles upon people they
felt were deserving of them.  Thus we would ahve a landed nobility chosen by
the people and confirmed by the king, and a court nobility, chosen by the
monarch.  Landed nobles would outrank court nobles with the same title.  

Then what about ex-royalty?  At the moment, it is customary to make them
vicounts, counts, and dukes.  But why?  The king, as the bearer of the Crown,
is preeminet in all the land.  But it is the Crown which is the source an
dsymbol of the Dream, of all honor, courtesy, and valor.   The king is only a
fallible human who for the moment happens to be the guardian of the Crown.  We
all can think of people who we thought were not really good monarchs, and yet
these people are autmatically rewarded with the highest titles the SCA has to
offer.   I think about Duke Sir Obnoxious the Violent and I shudder that this
man has one of the highest awardds we can bestow.  And he got the award simply
because he's a darn good stick jock.

Even the obnoxious people who have served as monarchs deserve recognition
because they did put a lot of time and effort into it, and they did do some
things right, and anyhow, only the people who have sat in the hot seat really
know what it's about.  Yes, there ought to be a reward for ex-royalty,a nd an
obligation that they offer up the wisdom of their experience to the current
monarchs or peers.  In the Midrealm there is the Order of the Rose into which
exqueens are automatically inducted.  I don't know too much about it, but the
purpose seems to be to recognize and reward courtesy and chivalry.  That's the
sort of thing ex-royalty are good for.   They've met an awful lot of people,
read a lot of letters, been to a lot of places, royalty have a greater
familiarlity with what goes on throughout the kingdom than most of the rest of
us do.

This is a drastic reordering of the way the SCA does business, but it is both
more medeival, and more workable than the current system.

And while I'm spouting heresy, can we please choose our royalty some other way
than the through the Stickjocks' Delight?  If we choose our kings with a
tourney, we  get kings who are good at bashing people on the head, which is not
a useful skill for the smooth and diplomatic running of the kingdom.  A kingdom
wide tourney to choose the King's Champion is a perfectly reasonable thing,
a kingdom wide tourney to choose a Lord General of the Armies or a Warlord is
also reasoanble, they are martial offices and martial prowess is necessary to
to them.  But the king is supposed to be the patron of the arts  and
sciences, service and the traditions of the kingdom, and the military arts are 
 just part  of the arts he should be knowledgeable about.

Yours in service to a reorganized SCA,

	I did quite a bit of research into this, and it appears they twisted
rods of steel/iron together, then welded the rods side-by-side to create
the sword.  This has been duplicated using period tools/materials and works.
The duplicates display the proper sort of markings in the steel.  I can

Unto the people of the Rialto and especially milady Awilda Halfdane Li Kung Lo
sends greetings! I was greatly singed by a recent posting in which you stated
that you were tired of chirurgeons trying to send you to the hospital because
you are handicapped. Your comment was deeply disturbing to me, and you gave no
details. I cannot help being struck by the feeling that one or more of the
following is true:

1) They aren't really chirurgeons, fully warranted, on duty, and bearing the
badge of their office, but generic EMT's standing around.

2) They really *are* chirurgeons, and they need a serious talking to. Did you
discuss any of this with the chirurgeon-in-charge (CIC) at the event, or the
relevent kingdom chirurgeon? Why just complain when you can *make a
complaint*? 

3) You went to a chirurgeon or somebody who cares summoned one. Remember, most
EMS people are trained with an emphasis on immobilization, stabilization, and
transport of a patient with a medical emergency. The assessment and support of
a person with a prior existing and known medical condition does not fall into
that category, unless a medical emergency exists. (If it does, see plan A) We
are not insured, trained, or licensed for that, and in many cases, what would
appear to be common sense supportive measures to a good samaritan are illegal
to us, and may represent professional misconduct/malpractice. Often our only
response is to say, "If this is an emergency, we'll get you to a hospital. If
it isn't, I think you should go home;you don't look well."

4) You *didn't* go to or summon a chirurgeon, and they are trying to be
helpful. You need to say,"I have a well known medical problem. I do not
require your assistance at this time. Thank you for your concern." It is also
polite to tell the CIC what your problem is. If it becomes a medical emergency
at a later point, valuable time will be saved.

5) You are stubborn, and you persist in going to events when you are really in
no shape to, because it is very important to you. Remember, you have not
cornered the market on stubborness in this outfit, and it is *your right* to
be stubborn. If your brothers and sisters (and the chirurgeon) seem
exasperated, remember we still love you-you are family.

        In any event, I care, and I want to hear from you, or from any
gentles, whether handicapped, chirurgeons, or observers who can add
perspective to the interaction between chirurgeons and handicapped people. If
we think your perception is slanted, we'll try to explain our position to you,
so you will understand us better, and make better use of the services we
offer. If the problem is with chirurgeons, we can talk to them about it, and
try to improve our performance by understanding *your* position better. If the
problem is in the structure, we'll address that problem, perhaps benefitting
everybody. Feel free to post or write me email directly.
        I can't tell you how touched I was by your comments on what the SCA
means to you, maybe I can touch you for just a minute, and you can see things
through my eyes:
        I have been awakened at 4:00AM to deal with the hypochondriac who was
having *another* anxiety attack. (Yes, I really do carry a teddy bear in my
jump kit...) I have been bled on in court garb because of ya-hoos playing with
knives. I've done an *entire war* (Pennsic XVI) where I never had one meal
that was not interrupted by a medical problem. (only one was an actual
emergency) I have been ignored by the marshall when I tried to pull a fighter
out of combat, only to spend 2 hours transferring him to the hospital an hour
and a half later, needlessly. I've been bitten by a drunk, and taken the blood
pressure of an abused, panicked woman clutching a razor sharp
broadsword,biting into her hands. I've spent 45 minutes trying to talk a
backboarded fool with a broken back into letting us transfer him to the
hospital, so he wouldn't have to live in a wheelchair forever. I've spent
countless unpaid hours and given away hundreds of dollars worth of free
medical equipment, and I can tell you that I don't do it because I love
medical emergencies, working for free on my time off, or because of the
wonderful feeling of power it gives me. I do it because I can't say no, you
are all my loved ones.
On the upside, I've seen the gratitude of the parents of a little girl whose
appendicitis was properly diagnosed, and seen her live to grow up. I've seen a
woman in anaphylactic shock saved by the prompt response of unpaid doctors,
nurses and paramedics, and I've seen the teddy bear work! I've had the
pleasure and honor of working with the finest volunteer paramedic team in the
world, and I would trade it for *nothing*.
        Please remember that when you make a comment about a group, it gets
their attention, and you can always get mine by bashing chirurgeons.

     I doubt that grabbing territory has much to do with it.  I suspect
that the main factor involved is seniority: when a new group is started
in a pre-existing group, most of the territory is likely to be left to
the old group (this seems to be the case with the Barony-Marche).  Also,
people who live a long way from the main center of a group's population
and activity are likely to split off and form a new group anyway.  This
just recently happened in Nithgaard.  Besides, even if you have a large
territory, that doesn't mean that you can recruit new members outside of
the central area(s) of your group.
     I agree that there should be a better way to divide up territory.  I
suspect that the current method is only used because of the way in which
the membership requirements are enforced.  Personally, I think that they
should do away with zip code boundaries for groups below the Kingdom (and
perhaps Principality) level, let people join any group they like, and not
go to the trouble of checking membership levels unless a group seems to
be in serious trouble.  But then, I don't know how this would work if it
were done this way.

Subject: Landed Counts


Lord Arval recently suggested that Landed Counts should be introduced to better
emulate period feudalism and recognise certain now unofficial groups. 

This comes close to one of my pet ideas, which is that a barony that has a 
baron that is also a royal peer could elect to form a group of that persons
rank. Ie if the baron of Someplace is also a duke, they could form the 
Duchy of Someplace. Such a group would have the same duties and priviliges
as an ordinary barony, save that they could have as subordinate groups all
groups of lower rank, ie a county could have subordinate viscounties and 
baronies and be subordinate to a duchy. 

This idea mainly serves the purpose of enhancing the medieval feeling of 
the SCA. One would have to find ways around extreme beaurocracy (sp?) so 
created.

But the Viscounty of Knights Crossing sounds nice, doesnt it?

I think that some way of making the SCA more resemble true feudalism would be 
very nice, Arvals probably a little more realistic than mine.

Harabanars nitpicking corner: A marquis/margrave would normally rank between 
a count and a duke in the real ranking systems I know.

Of course, this means there should be Landed Viscounts and Dukes as

Subject: yeast

i too, have seen ale yeast required in recipies. there are few pre-16th 
century recipies for bread, but there are several 14th and 15th c. recipies 
for batter, which call for yeast (some times confusingly spelled zest) or ale 
yeast.  
The romans (i am here paraphrasing from the work of Mistress Marian of 
Edwinstowe) used a sour-dough culture, and noted that the barbarians (i.e. the 
germanic tribes to the north) used ale yeast and got a much lighter bread.  
(they were also using a harder wheat)

in anycase it is good to remember that they were not using packets of dry 
yeast but a live culture, tossing in pints of ale barm (barm=yeast culture) at 
a time.  you could buy your barm, or you could keep your own.  Part of the 
pantry furnishings in many american houses was a yeast drawer, which was a 
small drawer lined with porcelin.

Ask your local brewers for a bottle of nice lively ale and toss it into your 
next batch of bread, substituting it for the liquid, or, drink the ale and 
just use the dregs in place of normal yeast.  It wont be nearly as fast as 
commercial yeast, but it will rise (eventually), and makes a nice loaf.

We once found the last inch of a jug of cider burbling away to itself on the 
back steps and used it as yeast--it made a dense but perfectly edible loaf of 
bread and it smelled wonderfull while it baked.

We in Carolingia (cambrige food-coop; they also have cubebs) can obtain two 
kinds of wheat, the red-grained hard wheat and the paler, plumper soft wheat. 
American flour is made of hard wheat, it takes much more liquid than european 
or middle-age flour.  The soft wheat has (i think) a better flavor.  The 
romans and the middle agers had several kinds of wheat, including spelt which 
is a variety of wheat of which i know none of the properties exept that its 
yeild is far smaller than that of the favored wheat.  Does any one know more 
about varieties of wheat as used in the midle ages, and whether they are still 
available?  Also, millet and vetches were both major crops, but i don't know 
how they were used...

Subject: metallurgy of mail armor, mead recipes

Some metallugical analyses of rings from mail shirts have been made (I have
to dig out my notes and find that article again!).
In all the rings sampled (from several different periods and places), the
metal was wrought iron (almost pure iron, carbon content far lowest than
the softest "mild" steel now available).
There is also no evidence for case hardening of mail, though it would be 
expected to strenghten it significantly.

The author of the article concluded that the mail makers valued ease of 
manufacture over strength of the resulting mail, as reasonably high quality
steel was used for other purposes (plate armor, weapons, ...). 
Certainly modern mailmakers prefer ease to strength, as they don't even bother 
riveting the rings.  
Wrought iron would be MUCH easier to punch and rivet than mild steel, as it
doesn't work-harden nearly as much.



For making mead, you should choose the yeast according to the type of mead you wish to make.  I use ale yeasts for "quick" fizzy meads, with about the strength of beer, and wine yeasts for stronger meads.
My best batch of mead was a strong dessert wine using a white wine yeast.
I fermented it for over a year and aged it in bottles for at least another two
years.
If people are interested, I'll try to dig up the recipe.

Subject: "That shire south of Columbus", & West, by God! Virginia
Message-Id: <607305831/kee@A.NL.CS.CMU.EDU>

Lord Kwelland's geography appears to be a little out of date.  There
are TWO shires in the general area of the Midrealm to which he refers.
The older one is Dearnheld (Athens, OH), founded in the early years of the 
Society (A.S. IV?  I am not sure) and it was there that I joined the SCA 
in A.S. X.  The newer one is Mugmort (Logan/Lancaster OH), formed around 
A.S. XV, as I recall (I was at the Court where it was officially
chartered.)  For all I know, there could be yet another forming between 
the Columbus area and Mugmort, since I haven't kept up with all the
changes in the SCA geography of the Columbus area in the past 10 years.

Now, as to West Virginia, Lord Kwelland's point that there are lots of
possibilities for carving up the place are well-taken, and have been
considered in the discussions of the issue.  (I speak here as a member
of the "Principality Committee" which was formed a year and a half ago
to try and bring the Principality into reality.)  But I can't help but
feel that putting the issue on the level of "WV is a problem, what can
we do?" or as I crassly put it above, "carving up the place" is kind of
rude.  (I speak here as one who was born and raised in Charleston, WV.)
I don't know of any SCA member in WV who has net access, aside from the
gentle who works for IRS in Martinsburg (I'm sorry, I can't remember
his name!) and he is probably an Atlantian, since he's located in the
extreme Eastern Panhandle of the state.  So if anyone is wondering why
these folks aren't speaking up for themselves on the Rialto, that's
probably why.  I think if they were present, they would say that the
discussion as it stands is not very mindful of them as SCA members;
that the geographical puzzle posed by the Principality formation is 
of far more interest to the Rialto than any consideration of what
the members in WV want their own SCA future to look like.

Fortunately the East Kingdom Seneschale wants to know what they want.
The decision currently rests with them, and they have several options,
and it looks like they may well ask to be re-polled.  The fact that the
BMDL voted to go with the Principality has changed the equation.
Re-polling may or may not reveal much of a change, or a difference
between what the southern part of the state says and what the northern
part of the state says, but I think it would be a wise option.  WV is
isolated both in SCA and mundane reality, and I think that poor
communication prior to the original polling may have led to votes being
cast on the basis of too little real information.  Now that more effort
has been made to talk it over, a re-poll could settle the issue in a
fairly clean way.

If it doesn't, then BMDL will probably cede ZIP codes to make a thin
bridge to the body of the East.  I would regard this as being a good
temporary solution (but if it led to a stable situation there would not
be much reason to change it.)  It would give things time to settle out,
and give the various groups in WV time to decide on an individual basis
whether or not they wanted to join another Kingdom.  There are good
points and bad points to all the proposed solutions, but I think that
the people who have to live with the consequences are in the best
position to decide what will work (given decent communication with the
East Kingdom Seneschale, with any other Kingdoms involved, and between/within 
the groups themselves.)

[I think that the "land bridge" idea is essentially equivalent to not
worrying about whether or not the East is contiguous.  It's a hack.
It would work for the foreseeable future, but if in future years a
shire wanted to form in the land bridge area, it could lead to bitter
dispute.  That is the main reason I think that if a land bridge is
resorted to, it should be thought of as temporary.  Otherwise it really
is a meaningless hack that simply removes a bureaucratic obstacle.
West Virginia is geographically and culturally isolated and a thin line
of ZIP codes isn't going to change that.  Only good communications and
good will on all sides can bring the shires there into mainstream SCA
life.]

Are we sure? Could some one check the Copora? I can't find my copy otherwise
I would (it's probably with my EK laws, where ever that is). Granted, it has
been a while since I read the (lean) part on principalities, but I don't
remember that the Kingdom not part of the principality had to be contiguous,
only that the political unit (kingdom or principality) had to be.
 
I seem to recall that the Eastern Seneschale made this statement. It makes
sense at that level since then you don't have a special administrative area
that is not attached to one of the contiguous blob type areas. I would hate
to see the BoD take yet another bashing because some kingdom level officer
made a ruling to keep that job sane.

Maybe we should use this as an argument to get a dispensation from the
appropriate level, rather than just bashing? Don't mind me, I'm just another
member of a principality conspiracy in the East, so I want to know the facts
and historical precidents.

Wm de Corbie:  I must take exception with your comparison of witches and
nazis.  You are comparing apples and oranges here.
  There are people still living who remember the nazis, what they stood for,
and what they did.  Concentration camps still exist, as do survivors of same. 
Someone who claimed that "good" nazis exist might very well be correct, but
would justifiably be doubted.
  On the other hand, the popular conception of the witch is based partly on
folklore, partly on Church propaganda, and only slightly on what actually
existed.  You are correct that most examples of witches portray them as evil. 
However, contraty to your claim, good witches do exist in popular mythology. 
For example: Glinda the Good in _The_Wizard_of_Oz_.  And the negative
stereotypes of witches bear more relation to the slanders made about jews
-i.e. that they use the blood of christian babies in their wafers.  Such
attitudes may very well be expected, but they should not be shrugged off with
an "Well, that's the way of the world."  You don't get rid of prejudices by
avoiding the issue.

Can't really say how the links were made--but how the wire was made
depends on period.  Wire-drawing dies were invented in the 1500s.
Prior to that, wire was made by hammering out a sheet of metal, cutting
it into strips, and hammering the strips into wire.  All-in-all, a *very*
labor-intensive project.  (Which explains why mail was expensive--even before
you worry about the work on the links!)  This wuold tend to produce rather
short pieces of wire, so winding may not be too efficient.

I believe the letter does refer to temporary disabilities--and of such nature
to make the more strenuous Society activities a problem.  I don't think
that an ongoing handicap--so long as the nature of it is not likely to
cause a sudden and dangerous medical condition to occur--should be any
bar to Society activity.  The only restraint should be the engage is those
activities that are within ones physical limits--but this applies the *all*
members of the Society, and at all times.

The smart thing is to let yourself be limited only by your imagination--and
there should be no better place to do that than within the Society.  From 
this and your following posting (about your search for maps), I conclude that
your time and efforts are valuable to the Society and should be encouraged--
both at home and at events, and that you should be *encouraged* to look
out from yourself and enjoy the Society.

Well put.  So far as I can see, you refuse to be limited by society-at-larges
opinion of what you can do.  This seems (from those I've known and read about)
to be the alternative to wallowing in self-pity.  Yours is the far better
course.
 
For the rest of us--I recommend reading "Reach for the Sky" (I forget the
author) which is the war memoirs of an RAF pilot who lost both legs--and
*then* became an ace.  He'd have *insisted* on fighting--and would have kept
at it until he earned a belt.

In response to the question of why West Virginia has to be attached to the

the BoD probably hasn't said anything about this situation, but it probably
has said that kingdoms have to be contiguous where (mundane) geography
permits.  (I don't have a corpora; could someone verify this?)  Best to set 
this up from the start so the Kingdom of the Lakes will be able to form

Subject: drawing wire
 
 
Wire drawing is MUCH older than the 13-th century---going back to at least the
10th century.  By the 13th century, wire-drawing was a separate guild in
parts of Germany--separate from the mail makers.  They bought their wire just 
as we do.  The main improvements in the 13th and 14th century were power 
equipment for wire-drawing, replacing the hand-drawn wire of previous centuries.
 
I have NEVER seen mail with triangular cross-section, but I have heard of 
D-shaped wire formed by drawing through a v-shaped notch (with a rounded bottom)
that had a crossbar to establish the diameter.  
 
I'm sorry I don't have my sources here at work, but if someone challenges me on this, I'll dig them up.
 
I DO WISH there was a decent book on the history of technology.  Unfortunately,
the "history of science" people all seem to believe that only theories matter,
so we may never see a history of practical technology.  Even more specialized
history (such as a history of metal working) would be valuable.  I have
seen some decent work in the history of textiles--perhaps someone who has
done more library work than me could point me to a good history of metal 
working?

Godfrey de Shipbrook writes:

The classic description of wire making involves the "wire-maker's swing",
like a porch swing, an iron-plate with a fine hole in it, and lots of
patience.  The end of a hot rod is fed (hammered down, likely) through
the hole, and gripped with pliers.  The wiremaker swings back, drawing
out the wire, then forward, and takes a new grip.
 
The survival of medieval knights and chainmail indicates that the
wire was fairly good.  Likely it was wrought (ductile) iron.

Subject:  Awards/behavior
 
Greetings!
 
Regarding the question of awards and behavior:  this is certainly not a unique
situation; I think it must arise in all Kingdoms.  Personally, I think it
perfectly proper to consider the behavior of a gentle in recommending/
considering that gentle for an award.  In the case of a possible Peerage, the
area of behavior should be, and is, given considerable importance.
 
It also depends on the award, though.  In the case of non-armigerous awards
and awards which carry AoA's, I have no problem with "well, he/she may be
utterly obnoxious, but they've done the work..."  Upon hitting the Grant of
Arms level, I start to give the area of behavior more weight.
 
First I consider whether the behavior of the individual in question is merely
annoying, or downright discourteous and/or harmful.  If I find that I lean
towards the former, then I try to look at whether or not the work the gentle
has done has been hampered by their behavior.  If not, and if the merely-
annoying behavior is something intrinsic to their nature, then I will tend to
go ahead and write the recommendation.
 
In the latter case however, I find that I often come to the conclusion that
work accomplished can indeed by offset by damage done to others.  It takes an
awful lot to convince me to write a recommendation for someone who injures
others _via_ their poor behavior.  We are *all* expected to live up to minimum
standards of courtesy in the Society, after all.
 
In an extreme case, such as seems to be with the instance which started this
whole discussion, I personally couldn't write a recommendation for a Kingdom-
leve/GoA-level award in good conscience.  But, neither could I let the
situation go on indefinitely without telling the individual what the problem
was:  I do beleive everyone has the right to be levelled with, as it were.
 
One thing that must be realized and accepted, regardless of what one thinks is
the right thing to do in such an instance as this, is that once one hs done
all one can, one shouldn't worry about it further.  If, for instance, the
gentle has been told in no uncertain terms, that their behavior is
unacceptable (and, P.S. that's why they don't get any recognition) and their
behavior fails to change, then hey-- you've done what you can; it's now
*their* decision.  If they decide not to change their behavior, it's their
problem, and their loss.  The idea of laying out the situation to the Crown
and leaving it for Them to figure out, while viable, doesn't resolve the
situation.  Nor does it make the Crown's life any easier:  they will be facing
the same quandry you are.  And, the ill-behaved individual may still not know
they've got a problem (although that doesn't seem to apply in this particular
case).
 
I want to add to the above, that I do not think there is anything *wrong* with
writing the Crown and laying out the entire situation.  I just think it dodges
the issue a bit.
 
I also think it important to note that the thought of giving someone an
"Attaboy!" for progess made, such as was described in a recent posting, is a
*great* idea, and an essential one.  Positive behavior deserves positive
reinforcement (Pavlov had a point, y'know...), and that's part of what awards
are for.
 
One more thing before I close:  can we **PLEASE** leave off the religion
topic, already?  Ain't it about time we started talking about the proposed new
_Corpora_?
 
Thanks for your attention.

I thank milord Li Kung Lo for his comments, and hereby disagree with them.
 
Milord, your example from the realm of language is irrelevant. The develop-
ment of languages is indeed erratic, but it has little to do with the life
expectancy of traditions that are handed down orally in a group of people.
The latter is certainly not subject to any firm "laws", but it can be
examined and has been so in the field of "family history" - a subject of
study at Swedish universities. We have made the observation that isolated
religious traditions normally don't survive very long. I maintain that
the notion of a Viking religion, secretly handed down intact to our time,
is absurdly unlikely if we judge from what we know of how these things 
usually work.
 
I have read a couple of books on modern paganism, with titles that sounded
very similar to those you refer to (sorry, they were loans from the library
and I cannot quote them since I don't have them). My impression was that they
were full of wishful thinking. The writers, themselves pagans (or sympathisers)
were using every means at their disposal to prove a pagan version of history,
i.e. they were interpreting facts to fit into their pre-meditated thesis.
 
Perhaps I chose the wrong books? But ever since witchcraft became popular among
students, there has been a demand for this type of literature, and I think I
see a pattern here. They make themselves out to be re-interpreting history and
correcting the Christian prejudices contained in the "official" academic
history-writing. Unfortunately, it is easy to write a book which gives a
scholarly impression on the average reader, even if the contents is bullshit.
The books I read were obviously based on a desire to legitimize paganism by
arguing its ancient heritage and exaggerating its importance in Christian times.
 
You are perfectly right that the old Norse paganism was not an organized
ryligion like christianity or judaism. It had no creed, no official collection
of dogma. Traditional religion probably varied a lot between regions and
even households. The same thing is true about all "old" religions in Europe.
There were various sets of traditions that interacted, Celtic and Germanic,
etcetera. We can identify a Norse religion as distinct from continental
Germanic religion, and so on. But the exact contents are not known.
 
What we *do* know is that most of the beliefs have been lost. We know of many
myths that existed but whose contents are now unknown. We can trcce names
of deities in place-names, but we know nothing about them except for their
names. Now, if you claim that modern paganism can trace its roots to the
Dark Ages, I won't argue with that. Religious phenomena such as magic and
witchcraft are virtually timeless. What I refuse is the notion that there
existed standard set of religious beliefs and practices which have been handed
down intact through the ages.
 
Further, I would like to challenge your statement that "5-7 million people
were tortured and put to death as witches by the Christian churches of
Europe and their secular representatives" between the years 1450 and 1670.
 
First of all, we should make a difference between those who were executed
by the inquisition and those who were burned in the great popular witch-
hunts. The inquisition was a sualified court (though of course not up to
modern standards), and it examined all cases thoroughly. If you look at the
protocols which remain to us, you will be surprised at how fair and even
rational they were. Also, recent studies have revealed that the number of
death sentences passed by the inquisition were far fewer than most people
believe. 
 
Most of the burnings were not the results of activities of the church, but 
of popular superstitions and mass-hysteria which erupted from time to time
throughout the renaissance. It clearly had extatic and mass-psychotic traits,
very interesting for psychologists but difficult for historians to explain.
The Church in Sweden actively opposed these persecutions and played a major
role in having them stopped. 
 
Your estimation of the number of killed is one of the highest I have seen.
In fact, nobody knows how many were killed, but *most* scholars make far
lower estimations, perhaps 100,000 to 300,000. We cannot know for sure, but
your figures are extreme.
 
Second, it is well known that those who were executed as witches were usually
*not* pagans, witches or any such thing. They were just people who were
different in one way or another, and became victims of popular xenophobia.
Modern research has noted the tendency to burn people who did not conform
to the normal mode of life in one way or another. Living in a house slightly
apart from the other houses of the village, or being a single woman, or
having too many children or too few children, or having too good teeth
or a swarthy complexion, or any such detail, could be enough to arouse the
suspicions of the bigots and hysteric xenophobes.
 
I never said that violation of civil rights were defendable. I was merely
trying to point out that negative attitudes toward witches aren't neces-
sarily caused by bigotry. I see every reason to condemn those who persecute
others for their religious beliefs. But I see no reason for condemning anyone
for putting an iron bar across his door if he knows that his neighbour openly
professes to worship satan and to being an evil and hostile person. And in
normal, every-day English, that is exactly what a witch is.
 
Well, now we have flogged this dead horse quite a lot. Let's sell it to
Mac Donald's so they can make hamburgers of it. (Truly pagan food, you
know, horsemeat...)

Subject: Face thrusting
Message-ID: <890328025602.10.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>
 
If my information is correct, there is a theory about SCA combat which states
that we are wearing chainmail and open-faced helmets, i.e. 11th century Norman
armor. This has been taken as a reason to allow face thrusts.
 
Face thrusts don't need to have the force of a killing blow. It's enough to
poke somebody in the face to get a kill. The theory is that a sword thrust
in your face would produce such pain and bleeding (which would blind you)
that even if the thrust itself did not kill you, you could no longer defend
yourself and would thus be killed by the next blow.
 
I disapprove of face thrusting. 
 
It can certainly be argued that the above explanation is authentic. But SCA
combat is not authentic. In a life-and-death combat, knights would hack at
their enemie's feet, they would kick them in the groin or knock them down
with their bodies, or trip them, and use all kinds of tricks and lethal
violence which SCA combat never uses. We cannot simulate these things for
reasons of safety, even in wars.
 
Single combat in the SCA is supposed to be chivalrous, not intending to really
kill but only to defeat an opponent by making a "good blow". Medieval tourna-
ments were not intended to kill people. Often, thrusting was banned as too
dangerous (at least, this is what I've heard, correct me if I'm wrong).
 
Face thrusting definitely belongs in the realm of lethal violence which could
never be simulated without serious damage if we were using open-faced helms 
and real swords. Thus, it would have to be banned from a tournament if the
object was not to kill. 
 
If we allow face thrusting, we should also allow all those other modes of
violence which were available even in peaceful tournaments, such as throwing 
your bodyweight against your opponent to bring him down. Face thrusting is
simply *too efficient* if it is combined with all the other restraints that
we have in SCA combat.
 
At least, that is how I feel. I want to be killed by a Good Blow, not by a
light prod on my faceplate.

chance to re-edit it...
 
i cut out the  quotes from the discussion on the nature of science that 
prompted me to write...
 
i cut out several unpleasant remarks about the posters...
 
i resume...
 
The question is whom to believe, and why?
 
	I can make a statement like "people did not eat beetroot befor the 
16th century"  citing as evidence the lack of evidence of anysuch thing in the 
O.E.D. and the period reciepts that i have seen, and i will continue to state 
this as a fact until someone finds a pre-1500 reference to beetroot as a 
(human) food.
 
	someone else (and her a laurel) can make the statement "people in the 
middle ages did not wear pink"  and cite lots of references (i'm not making 
this up.  this was a real hot topic for a while, i forget how and if it finaly 
got resolved) and i will not believe it because, **, there are manuscript 
border illustrations of people wearing pink. 
 
	papal denunciations of various practices, such as mariage among the 
clergy, are generaly considered to be good evidence that such things occured, 
but the meanings of the transcripts and confessions of the witch trials are hotly
disputed.  obviously, they are evidence of something, but evidence of what?
 
	The prompt lists for confessors which i mentioned earlier are generaly 
believed to be good evidence.  THere isn't any realy good reason not to 
believe them.  i wish i could lay my hands on a few-i only see them cited in 
secondary refs, but they're probably writen in some language i can't read 
(sigh).
 
	the documents on how to discover witches, and the confessions of 
witches are, however, generally not believed.  For one thing, some of the self 
proclaimed witch-hunters were later shown to be liars and frauds.  For 
another, the 'clever hans' effect works every bit as well for people having 
their vertebrae yanked apart as it does for animals with an instinct for their 
masters approval. for a third, many of the things confessed to were, frankly, 
unbelievable, even if taken largely as metephor, which they were not.  Again, 
while some of the witche's activities have independant parralels in folk 
custom (flying by night, werewolfism) many have much stronger ties to 
classical literary invective against unwanted cults that the romans used 
against out-of-favor gods' cults (and christians) e.g. ritual baby-slauter and 
cannibalism, ritual promiscuity including sodomy and incest, kissing the 
[idol, priest, god-incarnate] on the anus.
 
BTW-while moderns (american) witchs tend to ingenuously derive the name from 
words meaning 'life' or 'knowledege' or 'bending', the word the church for 
witchcraft was, of course, latin, "maleficia", lit. evil acts.  "maleficia" 
are, have always been, and should remain illeagal.

Good gentles,
 
As the East moves toward division into Principalities, I have given
some thought to landed nobility, feudalism, and the SCA.  My
conclusion has been that we don't have enough of any of these.  There
are very few examples in the SCA of a feudal structure more than
thgree layers deep: King, Noble, Retainer or King, Baron, Canton
Seneschal, Canton member is about as complicated as it gets.
 
Does anyone know of any more extensive examples?
 
It seems to me that we should have more feudalism, if we really want
to recreate medieval society, and that the SCA would greatly benefit
from it.  To that end, I have a (heretical) suggestion for discussion:
Landed Counts. 
 
In many parts of the Twelve Kingdoms, there are alliances formed among
neighboring shires and baronies, which have varying size and
formality.  For example, several shires in the southern reaches of the
East have for several years called themselves "The Mountain
Confederation".  Much of the area now forming the Principality of the
Lakes was for years known as The Western Marches.  The Baronies of
Nova Caesaria have banded together as The Wetlands Alliance.  These
alliances fight together, and often act together as a political unit.
They ARE feudal structures in the SCA, and it might be nice to have a
formal way to recognize them.  
 
I offer the possibility that several neighboring branches could, by
mutual agreement, have the Crown appoint a Landed Count to act as
their ruling noble.  He might hold court and give awards, as a Baron
does, but would rank higher than a Landed Baron.  All baronies and
shires under his sway would owe fealty to him, and he would swear
fealty to the Crown.
 
Of course, Landed Counts should rank below Royal Counts, just as Royal
Dukes in period & modern England outrank other Dukes.  The parallel,
in my mind, is perfect.  There should be no problem with confusion: We
have no problem remembering which Barons are enfeifed, and should have
even less problem with the few Counts created in this new way.
 
What do you'all think?  Is it worth pursuing?  Will the royal peers
scream & yell too much for it to work?  Could we solve that problem by
using some other title, such as "Marquis"?
 
I look forward to your ideas.  Good cheer!
 
	Arval.

 Last year the King of An Tir (I think it was King Steingrim) forbade 
 
Bofering with out a healm that protected the eyes. Many smalls were 
disapointed, but most of the other bofferers understood the need. We 
now encourage people who have boffer weapons to have fencing masks 
as well. The constabulary (yep, the bad guys with the antinni) _will_ 
stop unsuporvised or unhelmed boffering in An Tir.
 
 I wouldn't be suprised if they started requiring other padding soon, 
 
to prevent the kind of injury described above. Can't have our future 
fighters all taking in a falsetto. :-)

Sorry M'lord, but this is not quite the case.  The Karites (The sect
of Judaism that kept the five books of Mosses but rejected the
Mishna and Gemmorrah) persisted for several generations as a sizable
movement, and some Karite communitties exist to this day.

While it is true that communitties which loose the written word do
degenerate over time, that process can take many centuries.  The
Jews of Kai-Feng Foo continued to exist until into the 20th century,
despite having lost all nearly all their religious books by 1600
and loosing the last traces of them by 1750.  (I have ources available,
but I am working from memory.)

Again, not quite.  The reading of the Torah is used to mark the ceremony, but
is not required by Jewish Law.  The emergence into 'adulthood' (complete
responsibility for ones actions) occurs automaticly at 12 for a girl and
13 for a boy.  Today, for example, there are many boys/girls who go
through their bar/bat mitzvah without reading from the Torah.  Historically,
there have been times when the reading of the Torah in public was outlawed.
(Fifth Century, Eastern Roman Empire)  While the ideal of literacy and
knowledge have always been central, they are not required by Jewish law.

	{ I wondered when this was going to come up . . . }

	Sorry, m'lord, but the analogy doesn't apply -- unlike paganism,
Judaism was and is a primarily _written_ tradition -- without the Torah,
there is no Judaism.  The sects of Judaism that lacked, lost, or rejected
the Torah, Mishnah, and Gemara died out within 3 generations (or became
Christianity :-).

	From the time of the fall of the Temple to this day, the way a Jewish
male becomes a man -- recognized as an active part of the Community of
Israel -- is to stand in front of the congregation and _READ_ from the
Torah.  (Carping about the frequent practice of "learning the sounds" and
"memorizing without understanding" aside -- it is the _reading_ that is
the central issue.

	Judaism preserved the ideal of literacy through the black night of
the European Dark Ages, and it is to the Jewish scholars of Iberia that
we owe our knowledge of almost all of Classical thought and writing.
Vivant!

	Literacy was fairly uncommon in Classical times, damned rare in any
culture outside of Rome and Greece, and almost unheard-of north of the
Alps.  Where native writing systems _did_ exist, they were the secret
province of a priesthood, and definitely _not_ passed down in families.

	Such priestly communities as presented political opposition to the
Romans were systematically hunted down and destroyed -- Druids in
Britain, for instance -- and _nothing_ survives.  The Church did the same
after 900 A.D., for the same reasons, and with the same effects.

	Native oral traditions require the active and enthusiastic support of
a living community of a certain size to continue -- when the community
shrinks below a certain size, the religion dies.  On the other hand, a
_written_ tradition needs only one person in each generation, together
with a book, to survive.

The latest Tournements Illuminated had some Epistles to the Editor I wish to
respond to.  In particular, I wish to respond to the gentle who said that
people who were ill or injured ought to do the "chivalrous" thing and stay
home, rather than bothering their friends with their problems.  I think the
gentle was referring to people who are temporarily disabled, not permanently or
lengthily disabled, but all the same, I've seen the same attitude all too
frequently.  (I am tired of chirugeons trying to send me to the hospitable
because I am a disabled person).

I am a handicapped person, a fact which has led me to suffer a lot more
discrimination than being pagan has.  Being pagan runs the risk of maybe
getting beat up by redneck Christians, being handicapped means that
well-meaning people keep trying to run my life and prevent me from having a
normal life.

Yes, handicapped people in the SCA cannot do many of the things other people
do.  But in the SCA we need all kinds of people with all kindss of skills and
interests.  I will never scrub the floor after an event, and its been a while
since I've been able to serve one, but who else is going to spend the morning
carving apples into little birds for the Royal Lunch?  And who else is
organizing children's classes when nobody else wants the burden?

yes, the smart thing would be for me to stay home and take care of myself.  But
I am trapped at home for days upon end with no social life to speak of.  I am
willing to pay the price of physical pain in order to see people and talk to
them, to make myself useful.  Human beings need social contact more than they
need security. And since I cannot work at a paying job, I am doing things for the
SCA.  Human beings need to feel useful and appreciated.  

It's really very easy to accomodate a handicapped person.  If we can cope with
fighters and their excess of baggage while traveling, or parents with children,
or cooks who drive themselves crazy in the kitchen, we can certainly cope with
handicapped people.

Actually, "Pooh-Bear" has pretty good provenance.  Back at Pennsic

I am currently at work on an accurate, to scale map of Atlantia.  I am having
some difficulty deciphering the locations and territories of some of the
southern SCA groups.  I would greatly appreciate any help.  In particular:

1)I would like to aquire state maps of South Carolina, North Carolina, and
Virginia.  These maps should be sufficiently detailed that they show county
borders and small towns.  I will be glad to reimburse the costs of the maps.  

2)I would also like it if gentles living in these areas could clarify the
boundaries of the baronies in these states.  

I have noticed a certain lack of consistancy in how the groups are reported in
the Atlantia Regnum.  Is this because territories are assigned in  an
inconsistant manner, or is the fault merely in how the regnum is printed?  Can
anyone tell me who the arbiter of territories is?  Are there any standards
about how teritories are allotted?

I am of course, familiar with the population requirements for baronies, shires,
etc.  I have noticed that some shires encompass half a state while some
baronies are only a single city.  This seems a rather strange way to divide up
territory.  I realize that by grabbing  a bigger teritory a group can claim
more members and thus maintain its status.  Makes for some very strange
mapping, though.  I wonder if maybe a better way of dividing territory might be
divised.

The new Principality if the Lakes presents another interesting problem.  It
cuts off West Virginia from the rest the Eastrealm, a condition prohibited.
(Groups must be continguous to the area they claim allegiance to).
Negotiations are under way to make a land bridge that connects West Virginia
to the East.  I can understand the people of West Virginia wanting to  stay as
part of the East, but if the principality of the Lakes survives, West Virginia
is going to be effectively isolated from the East anyhow.  Seems like the best
solution would be to include them in the new principality, or maybe attach them
to Atlantia.

Greetings, my lady Awilda.

All SCA groups are officially defined in terms of ZIP codes.  Each
groups covers a given set of ZIP codes, and its boundaries are the
boundaries of that region.  The Kingdom Seneschal should have a full
listing of the ZIP codes for each group, so you can probably get all
the info you need from that source.  Most good local maps show ZIP
code boundaries; if not, I believe the post office can supply a
complete map.  

The question of what to do with WV is indeed a cofusing one.
Currently, the WV groups have a month to decide whether or not they
wish to join the incipient principality.  If they decide not to, then
there will be two options: Get BMDL to cede ZIP codes along the
southern edge of PA, to create a Land bridge between WV and the rest
of the East, or to re-assign WV to other Kingdoms.  There has been
some very unofficial, speculative, please-don't-take-this-too
-seriously talk about having some of WV go over to the Middle and some
to Atlantia, but nothing has been decided yet.  

Personally, I find the BoD's requirement that each group be contiguous
silly.  Why does it matter?

Re:  Western use of Thrusting Tips and Shield Size.

The West (I believe) has allways allowed thrusting tips.  At least
for the last 10 years, I think since forever.  However, while they
have been common, they have never been "the norm".  i.e. most
fighters don't use them, but if you get to 6-7th round at a Crown
List you probably had to fight at least once vs. a thrusting tip.

We don't use the "touch you're dead" school of face thrusts (seems
kind of silly to me).  I don't think you'll ever get Westerners to
accept shots that hit the bars on their help, that are 3" away from
their face.  Basically, a thrust needs to be "solid", but not a
strong as a normal attack.

Also, most of the thrusting tips are attached to shortswords or
greatswords, etc., but not usually to a broadsword.  Attaching a
thrusting tip to a broadsword causes it to become "less useful",
i.e. balance gets thrown off, etc.

Even in wars, where A LOT of thrusting tips are found, they are very
rarely attached to broadswords, but you will find A LOT of
shortswords, axes, maces, polearms, pikes, etc., with them.

As to fighting quality:  (warning: don't take this personally)  My
opinion is that the problem stems from the training.  Basically,
TRAIN YOUR NEW FIGHTERS WITH BROADSWORDS (WITHOUT THRUSTING TIPS),
and don't let them have thrusting tips until they are well versed in
the basics.  Just like you don't teach "the rap" until you have
taught "the snap".

This won't stop new fighters from putting thrusting tips on their
weapons, but if all your training is directed at using "the edge"
they will quickly learn to leave them off, until you show them how
to use them.  With Squires, and other members of a Knight's
Household, this shouldn't be a problem, just say NO.

Here in the West (or at least in the Mists) most new fighters get
trained with broadswords and 24" round shields.  After they have
been trained in the basics (about the time the round shield breaks)
they should know enough about fighting to decide what weapon/shield
they want to specialize in.  As I said, there isn't anything
stopping a new fighter from using a thrusting tip, but they will
have trouble finding anyone to teach them how to use it.

Re:  "Basic Training" of new fighters.  In the Mists, new fighters
are usually trained in groups.  Starting with "slow work" until they
have armor built, and then progressing through various stages of
training.  The new fighters are basically "segregated" from the
experienced fighters, unless one of the experienced fighters is
training one of them.  i.e. the trainees are at one end of the
fighter practice, and the experienced fighters at the other.

This allows the experienced fighters "to avoid" training new
fighters (on any specific day), if they want.  And, also, keeps the
trainees from being "pounded" on.  Many of the experienced fighters
will spend part of practice with the trainees, and then move to the
other end, to fight "tough" opponents.

This may only work as the "BART Bash" practice on Thursdays usually
has a lot of fighters (i.e. 20) on a good day, so it can basically
be two fighter practices.  Tuesdays, at "BART", is basically for new
fighters, and is more of organized "training" (with fewer
experienced fighters).  Also, on Tuesdays and Sundays, we have the
"Mission College" fighter practice, which is similiar to BART, but
smaller.

Also, there have been true "newbie classes" held on off days, which
are strictly for teaching basics.  The classes vary depending on the
teacher (i.e. limited class size, etc.).

I would be interested in hearing how training is done in other
places.  Especially, those places with radically different fighting
styles (i.e. you guys up in An Tir, I've been to some of your
fighter practices.  But everyone else hasn't.).  Enough of this.

Re:  Shield sizes.  I've allways thought limiting shield sizes was
silly (similiar the limiting thrusting as silly).  The "official"
rules (whatever that means) allready limit shields in that the can't
be constructed using modern materials that give "excessive
advantage", i.e. clear plastic shields, etc.  This "rule" could
reasonably be used to limit shields that have too low a "density",
i.e. wieght/square foot.

One of these days I'm going to build a tourney legal stretched
leather shield, to see how much it weighs, and how it works.  But it
will be a while.

In the West, which has no limitations on shield size, the most
common shields (for tourneys) are:

        1)  Heaters:  Size:  Approx 22-24" wide by 32-36" tall, some
        curved, some flat.  (I may not have the size exactly right
        since I don't use one.)
        2)  Round Shields:  Size:  24" (some variance, but most
        round shields in the west are 24")
        3)  "Radnor Rounds":  Size:  24" by 24".  (there is some
        variance, usually in length)  A "Radnor Round" is square on
        the top, and round on the bottom.  i.e. take a 24 by 24
        square, and cut the two bottom corners off, round, but leave
        the top two as is.  The style is similiar to "agressive"
        round shield, i.e. punch blocking, not rotating.  The shield
        style was made popular by Duke Sir Radnor of Gildemar (sp?).
        It is also know as a "Bunny Round", i.e. a round shield

There are a few other shield types seen, but not many (i.e.
bucklers, or Norman Kites).  I keep threatening to use my war kite
(24 by 48, rounded, pointed bottom) and a shortsword, but I haven't
yet.  (I did use a 18" by 36" flat kite for a while.)  I HATE
fighting big shields, but I don't think that should stop them from
being used.  My Knight (and many other Knights I've talked to) LIKE
to fight big shields, since they are slower than smaller shields.
Oh well, one of these days I'll be "fast" and then I'll probably
like to fight them too!

Enough for now.

Subject: New Eastern Principality
Message-Id: <2515@lindy.Stanford.EDU>

I have a BIG question, regarding the "problem" of West Virginia (?)
being non-contiguous with the non-Principality portions of the East.

So what, big deal...

The new Principality is part of the East, correct?  So what if the
non-Principality portions of the East are on opposite sides of the
Principality?

Out here in the West, the northern part of the "Marches" are
non-contiguous from the southern part.  i.e. the Principalities of
the Mists, and Cynagua seperate them.  Unless you count the Pacific
Ocean as connecting them.  And until recently, Oertha (Alaska), was
seperated by another Kingdom (An Tir), unless of course you count
the ocean again.  (Oertha is now a Principality)

Note:  It is 11 hours, by car, from the "Northern Marches" to the
"Southern Marches" (via the SF Bay Area).

And I'm not even going to bring up Australia or Japan...

I couldn't agree with you more, my lord Etienne.  However, the BoD, in
their often-questionable wisdom, will not permit the creation of a
Principality which cuts off part of a Kingdom from the rest.  I don't
see any logic to it, but they will not be swayed.

Well, my lord (and you should take this in the friendly manner in
which it is intended), the BoD has always considered the West to be
special.  There are LOTS of cases where the West got to do something,
but some other Kingdom has not been allowed to.  And they wonders why
we Easterners don't much care for the BoD!

Personally, I want an Emperor, but that's another heresy.

Good cheer!

Or we could discuss how to ignore BoD policies successfully (and

This has been an interesting discussion.  William, I would like to thank
you for your comments.  I have found them on this and other issues to be
very thought-provoking.

I'm afraid I have to disagree with your viewpoint in this instance.
Witches have been more frequently evil, true, but this is not universally
the case.  Particularly in this decade people read about sorcery and its
uses in a positive sense.  Most high school level history discussion on
witchcraft (say, in the Middle Ages) does in fact stress that the typical
image of a witch came from the appearance and mannerisms of those women
who lived to an unusual age.

If they survived years of childbirth, women lived longer than men (which
is why witch is identified as female).  With no dental care, the teeth fall
out, leading to the hooked nose and protruding chin effect - it's really
from missing teeth.  Wrinkles and sparse white hair, along with other
signs of age (age is not exactly pretty to the young), complete the look.

Looking so different, and seemingly having cheated death, these women were
off to a bad start.  Add to that a possible crabbiness from being old,
possibly arthritic, and most likely alone in the world.  Now increase that
crabbiness with the natural resentment stemming from being mistrusted due
to age and appearance, and you have a very bad-tempered old lady.  I'm sure
this isn't new to anyone; I'm just saying this is what lots people are
taught.

Any history lesson at the States that covers the Salem witch trials debunks
the accusations of witchcraft that were hurled around so freely.

In other words, lots of people learn (at an impressionable age) that
so-called witches are more likely ordinary misunderstood humans.  (Which
doesn't do much for their reputation in the modern world - people tend
not to believe in them.)

Science fiction and fantasy readers get still another viewpoint - that of
people of real power who use it for good - and who strongly disapprove of
those who use it for evil.  Power in fantasy frequently destroys those who
misuse it.

Even those who don't read SF or fantasy, and who don't cover historical
witchcraft in school still can have their opinions affected - hordes of
people have seen the Wizard of Oz (or read the book - but I counted them
under readers above) - Glenda, remember?  The Good Witch?

Before anyone beats me to it, I will stay that the dictionary definition
of witch (Webster's II, New Riverside University Dictionary, 1984 - my
employer bought it, not me - I'll check my OED when I get home) does say
a woman who practices black magic, not magic.  (Black magic is defined
further along as magic in league with the Devil.)  There are definitions
of other words (magic, for one) which do not imply evil, but this is not
one of them.  (The secondary definition is an ugly, vicious old woman -
in line with the comments on middle ages above.)

I still think that the common understanding of the term is such that
the possibility of good uses of power is part of the word.  That's one
person's opinion.  I think the above examples are enough to show that
the term has not been redefined by a small group of intellectuals somewhere,
but rather by a large mass of population, over a lengthy period of time.

Subject: expectations, and the disappointment thereof (was RE:  witches)

This is a very long posting.  I apologize for that in advance.  I also
get the list in digest form, so I know how much of a pain it is to
read through pages of a long message that you don't find interesting,
just to get to the next message.  I hope this gets posted at the end
of a digest.

I didn't mean to get this long.  Please let me know if you think the
length or content of this message is inappropriate.  I wax a little
eloquent, but I believe my points are relevant.  (Believe me, I do -
otherwise I wouldn't post this.)

William de Corbie wrote in an earlier posting that those who flaunt their
differences should expect to be ostracized or harassed by the general
populace.  (My apologies to William if I've mistated his views for the
sake of brevity.)

At first, I agreed with his statement.  It really makes a lot of sense.
On further reflection, however, I don't agree that those are realistic
expectations for the cross-section of the US population that reads this
list.  Please note that I'm speaking in generalities here.  I'm sure that
there are US readers who have had personal experience or education that
leads them to these expectations.

For the most part, however, there is a common set of characteristics
which define the members of this group - and those characteristics lead
this group to expect tolerance of other viewpoints.  Please note that
I will only address US demographics - I don't have enough information
about SCA-list readers outside the US.

For example, the US readers on this list are technology freaks - or
married or related or close friends with someone who is.  The evidence?
A computer link which allows the list to be read, and sufficient
familiarity with mailing systems and networks to gain access.

Computer literacy leads us to education - I would bet that most of
the readers on this list are college educated.  Many are still in school,
some are working for companies technologically oriented enough to
provide network access to their employees.  A college education in the
US leads one to the water of tolerance.  Some would say it even tries
to make you drink.

Not only do the professors encourage critical thinking and recognition
of other viewpoints (no flames, please - I'll bet that at least one
professor in the four years that a hypothetical student spends in college
was both motivated to do the above and managed to reach that student),
but also the environment encourages tolerance.  For the first time (for
many students), there are new people around, people who talk differently,
and act differently, and dress differently, and think differently.

Some high school students (or even elementary school, while we're regressing)
get the same kind of exposure.  Racial and cultural mixing takes place
in many schools far more than in the workplace or at home.

For the benefit of those outside the US, elementary school is grades 1-8,
ages 6-13.  High school is grades 9-12, ages 14-17.  Sometimes, grades
7 and 8 or grades 7-9 are called middle school (ages 12-13 or 12-14).  Keep
those pubescent kids off by themselves, where they can't wreak too much
damage.

The standard four years of college after high school (if you went at all)
is losing ground, though is still (I think) the most common.  That would
be ages 18-21.  Lots of people skip grades, or wait a few years between
high school and college, or take off a year or so in the middle, or stretch
it out to 5 years, working alternate terms.  Also, lots of people who
quit school many years ago are returning.  About a third of my college
was older people coming back to school - I was in school with my mother,
for heavens sake.

Sorry for the digression - I just wanted to be clear.  Comparative
scholasticism can be confusing.  So much for education (in case you'd
forgotten the topic by now).

Technophilia and education combine to make it quite likely that most
readers are also science fictions fans.  Nothing (that I can think of
at the moment - anyone want to saw off this branch?) is more intrinsically
tolerant of other viewpoints than science fiction.  It is very hard to
be an SF fan and not begin to sign on to the belief that other viewpoints
are valid.  (It is possible to be a hardened technocrat, only reading
hard SF, and retaining a narrow viewpoint.  It is not common.)

Now look at the effect of SCA membership.  Let's face it, the people
we meet in this group are a little weird.  Lots of members are misfits
in society (don't take this personally - just count the ones you know).
Escapism is one of the reasons people join this group ... and people
escape in lots of different ways.  Group members learn to tolerate and
even enjoy differences in the people around them.

In short :-), the environment of most of the US readers of this digest
has accustomed them to the idea of tolerance for other viewpoints; to
tolerate other people's differences and to expect the same in return.

Those of us who have experienced racism or sexism or "jingoism" or any
other "sectism" have had our expectations lowered (at least a little),
but we are few.  The readers of this group are, for the most part, young.
The civil rights movement and the women's liberation movement have wrought
many changes in our culture, but most of the struggle was before our time -
certainly the more violent aspects.  Blatant discrimination has in large
part gone underground.  Many, if not most, blatant acts are quite illegal.
Subtle discrimination is still quite rampant - but we are not attuned to
seeing it.

We don't see discrimination, and so we don't expect it.  We expect people
to behave in a tolerant and non-discriminatory fashion.  I don't think
this is a bad thing.  People tend to live up to other's expectations of
them.

For examples of the expectations of others affecting behavior, look at
schools - the expectations of the teacher have a bearing on the performance
of the students.  The same kind of effect is visible with parents and
children.  Look at little closer to home, at fellow members of the SCA.
When a group expects chivalry, the individual members of that group
behave more chivalrously.

The first time your expectations are seriously let down, either by the
action of an individual in a serious breach or by the collective actions
of a group in a less serious breach (I mean, it would seem less serious
if it were the act of an individual), the foundation of your world is
shaken.  Nothing has prepared you for unjust behavior on the basis of
a silly category, or on any basis other than personal dislike (which is
accepted if deplored as an individual breach of expectations).

This shattering of your world view is bad enough, without the added
strain that I see in the story that started this discussion.  (I'm sorry,
I wasn't going to follow up, so I didn't save that posting.)

Most of us in the group as described, in addition to the rose-colored
glasses we wear about people, have an optimism about the fairness of
government.  The age group represented doesn't have the same need to
rebel against authority that the previous generation (?) did.  Most of
us consider our government to be in fact of the people, by the people,
for the people.  Those few of us who have had run-ins with various
government branches, such as the IRS, know this is not the case.  However,
because of the collective age of the group, these are again few.

To have the prejudices of one intolerant community and their desire for
oppression and harassment aided and abetted by the very forces we expect
to defend our rights to freedoms of expression and lifestyle is an
absolute nightmare.

To the pagan who posted the tale, and to all those who have experienced
any such form of oppression or harassment ... you have lost your
innocence, and it can never be reclaimed.  I beg of you, please don't
let that loss lower your expectations for other people's behavior.  We
cannot lower the standard of tolerance, or chivalry, for who will raise
it up again?

I have to disagree here.  Hypothetically, say there is a man who does great
services for his kingdom.  However, there are no women in the kingdom who
would trust him to walk them back to their cabins alone.  That kind of
mistrust goes against so much of what the society stands for.  In my
humble opinion, this kind of unchivalrous behavior is as strong a disservice
to the kingdom as all of his other services.  Service to the kingdom
involves service to the kingdom's people.  Yes, the Society is very much
a family.  However, if someone walks into a room and 3/4 of its occupants
exit as he does...  *shrug*  sumpin's gotta be wrong.

I can't really say if I think the gentle in question should be granted the
award but I do believe that his behavior should be considered, *especially*
if it is as blatant as the lady who posted the original message has claimed.

If one is interested in the history of witchcraft, a good notion might be to
concentrate on the European experience, which included the execution of hundreds
of thousands of witches (mostly in Germany) rather than the American experience,
where the score (if memory serves) was about three dozen.

Another good notion for those interested in history is to avoid history lessons.
 Especially the kind you get in high school or on television.  The great Salem
witch trial accounted for most of those three dozen odd executions.  And the
defendents *were* guilty.

(Well, they were guilty in the sense the Socrates was guilty, anyhow.  That is,
we may feel today that it is inappropriate to execute people for sacrilege, but
we don't claim that the sacrilege (by the standards of the accusers) didn't take
place.)

The thrusting tip is about 2 1/2 inches of foam with two strips of 
flexible 8 ounce leather over it to firm it up and keep it from bending
aside.  It is a little stiff, but I've never had it fail inspection.
As for it making people not take tip shots... are they supposed to? If 
I don't hit them with the effective area of the blade I don't want them
falling down anyway.  I also have a thrusting tip on my axe.  

	My only complaint about them is that people seem to want to be
hit harder with a thrust than with a blow in order to take a kill.  This
means that my blows with the tip are sometimes near the upper limit of
how hard I care to strike, and given that the chance of a glance coming
up into someones throat of chin you can see why I don't use them very 
often.  

	As for face thrusts, I've lived in one kingdom that allowed them,
and on the border of two that differed in their rulings on them.  As long
as people are trained to use them properly (especially two-handed thrusts)
I don't have any problem with them, though some of my friends who are
chirurgeons shudder when they hear of their use.  I like them especially
in bridge type battles, where they shorten the fighting time significantly.

	I'm looking forward to seeing how the East's current trial with them
works.  The restrictions on them seem a little much, to the point where I
don't know if they will get a lot of people testing them (watch me be wrong 
there.)  Only time will tell.

The origin of the Kara'ite schism was political in nature, but their basic

The padding in my helm was done partially by the lord that I bought it from,
it consists of a foam cutout that is shaped the same as the inside of the helm,
taped together and inserted, it is not glued or taped in and stays in just
fine.  I also have a piece of foam that I put inside an old pillow case, which
I insert inside my helm which is much more comfortable than foam against the
face, and is very easy to take out and wash.  The only problem is that it
sometimes slides up with my head when I put it on so I need a firm grip on the
padding when I put it on.

Subject: Chainmail Question

Originally the wire for chainmail was constructed in the same manner
as anything else made of iron or steel, it was hammer forged by a 
blacksmith.  I believe the wires were usually triangular in cross-
section.  That is alot easier to form on a forge than a round cross-
section.

At some point they developed the process of drawing wire.  This is done
by pulling a bar of metal through progressively smaller holes in a
'draw plate', annealing the metal as necessary to maintain it's maleability,
till the wire has reached the desired size.  I think the process of
drawing out wire was developed in Germany in the 13th or 14th Century.
(It's been a while since I read about this.)

     All that I know about the specific details is what was described
on the Rialto, so my comments should not be taken as referring to the
particular person under discussion (whoever he is).

In article <2485@lindy.Stanford.EDU>, AR.SEG@forsythe.stanford.edu
 (Steven E Goodman) says:
>popularity, popularity.  I always thought awards weren't supposed to
>be popularity contests?  But that seems to be the way things work
>Etienne d'Argent           AKA    Steven Goodman
(Nota Bene: some others also referred to the "popularity" issue; this is
just what I chose to quote as an example.)

     The way I see it, the "popularity contest" situation is where it all
depends on how many friends you have to recommend you.  Nobody should ever
recommend someone for an award just because that person is their friend,
and no deserving person should be left out just because they don't have a
lot of friends - except for the Order of the Life of the Party ;-).  But
in the case of "Lord Gunther de Grab," what is relevant is not how many
friends he has, but rather how many enemies he has made, and how he has
made them.  This is NOT just a question of popularity.
     I think that anyone who is to be inducted into any order should be
willing and able to meet a standard of conduct such that they will not be
a disgrace to that order.  This is especially important for the Patent
Peerages, but it should be a consideration for any award.  And awards are
not just for what people do, but also for how they do it.
     Let me consider this in a different way: people get awards not for
what they do, but for what they are.  For instance, if someone is willing
to study a period art/science with an open mind and share their knowledge
and their skills with an open heart, then that person is a good candidate
for the Order of the Laurel.  Their classes, arts projects, or whatever
are only the results of their attitude.  And when an award is given, it
indicates respect for its recipient, not just for their accomplishments.
So I think that it is reasonable to consider how someone behaves (at least
when their behavior is exceptionally good or bad) in deciding whether or
not they should get an award.
     On the other hand, I think it's okay to be somewhat relativistic in
this respect, so that even if someone's behavior/attitude leaves a lot to
be desired, it could be overlooked if it is generally tolerable, and if it
is actually a remnant of a worse problem which they have made considerable
progress in curing themselves of (what an ugly sentence - I hope it at
least says what it means ;-) ).

	{ I wondered when this was going to come up . . . }

	Sorry, m'lord, but the analogy doesn't apply -- unlike paganism,
Judaism was and is a primarily _written_ tradition -- without the Torah,
there is no Judaism.  The sects of Judaism that lacked, lost, or rejected
the Torah, Mishnah, and Gemara died out within 3 generations (or became
Christianity :-).

	From the time of the fall of the Temple to this day, the way a Jewish
male becomes a man -- recognized as an active part of the Community of
Israel -- is to stand in front of the congregation and _READ_ from the
Torah.  (Carping about the frequent practice of "learning the sounds" and
"memorizing without understanding" aside -- it is the _reading_ that is
the central issue.

	Judaism preserved the ideal of literacy through the black night of
the European Dark Ages, and it is to the Jewish scholars of Iberia that
we owe our knowledge of almost all of Classical thought and writing.
Vivant!

	Literacy was fairly uncommon in Classical times, damned rare in any
culture outside of Rome and Greece, and almost unheard-of north of the
Alps.  Where native writing systems _did_ exist, they were the secret
province of a priesthood, and definitely _not_ passed down in families.

	Such priestly communities as presented political opposition to the
Romans were systematically hunted down and destroyed -- Druids in
Britain, for instance -- and _nothing_ survives.  The Church did the same
after 900 A.D., for the same reasons, and with the same effects.

	Native oral traditions require the active and enthusiastic support of
a living community of a certain size to continue -- when the community
shrinks below a certain size, the religion dies.  On the other hand, a
_written_ tradition needs only one person in each generation, together
with a book, to survive.

Message-ID:  <8903271052.aa26672@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

The latest Tournements Illuminated had some Epistles to the Editor I wish to
respond to.  In particular, I wish to respond to the gentle who said that
people who were ill or injured ought to do the "chivalrous" thing and stay
home, rather than bothering their friends with their problems.  I think the
gentle was referring to people who are temporarily disabled, not permanently or
lengthily disabled, but all the same, I've seen the same attitude all too
frequently.  (I am tired of chirugeons trying to send me to the hospitable
because I am a disabled person).

I am a handicapped person, a fact which has led me to suffer a lot more
discrimination than being pagan has.  Being pagan runs the risk of maybe
getting beat up by redneck Christians, being handicapped means that
well-meaning people keep trying to run my life and prevent me from having a
normal life.

Yes, handicapped people in the SCA cannot do many of the things other people
do.  But in the SCA we need all kinds of people with all kindss of skills and
interests.  I will never scrub the floor after an event, and its been a while
since I've been able to serve one, but who else is going to spend the morning
carving apples into little birds for the Royal Lunch?  And who else is
organizing children's classes when nobody else wants the burden?

yes, the smart thing would be for me to stay home and take care of myself.  But
I am trapped at home for days upon end with no social life to speak of.  I am
willing to pay the price of physical pain in order to see people and talk to
them, to make myself useful.  Human beings need social contact more than they
need security. And since I cannot work at a paying job, I am doing things for the
SCA.  Human beings need to feel useful and appreciated.  

It's really very easy to accomodate a handicapped person.  If we can cope with
fighters and their excess of baggage while traveling, or parents with children,
or cooks who drive themselves crazy in the kitchen, we can certainly cope with
handicapped people.

Message-ID:  <8903271119.aa27531@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>


I am currently at work on an accurate, to scale map of Atlantia.  I am having
some difficulty deciphering the locations and territories of some of the
southern SCA groups.  I would greatly appreciate any help.  In particular:

1)I would like to aquire state maps of South Carolina, North Carolina, and
Virginia.  These maps should be sufficiently detailed that they show county
borders and small towns.  I will be glad to reimburse the costs of the maps.  

2)I would also like it if gentles living in these areas could clarify the
boundaries of the baronies in these states.  

I have noticed a certain lack of consistancy in how the groups are reported in
the Atlantia Regnum.  Is this because territories are assigned in  an
inconsistant manner, or is the fault merely in how the regnum is printed?  Can
anyone tell me who the arbiter of territories is?  Are there any standards
about how teritories are allotted?

I am of course, familiar with the population requirements for baronies, shires,
etc.  I have noticed that some shires encompass half a state while some
baronies are only a single city.  This seems a rather strange way to divide up
territory.  I realize that by grabbing  a bigger teritory a group can claim
more members and thus maintain its status.  Makes for some very strange
mapping, though.  I wonder if maybe a better way of dividing territory might be
divised.

The new Principality if the Lakes presents another interesting problem.  It
cuts off West Virginia from the rest the Eastrealm, a condition prohibited.
(Groups must be continguous to the area they claim allegiance to).
Negotiations are under way to make a land bridge that connects West Virginia
to the East.  I can understand the people of West Virginia wanting to  stay as
part of the East, but if the principality of the Lakes survives, West Virginia
is going to be effectively isolated from the East anyhow.  Seems like the best
solution would be to include them in the new principality, or maybe attach them
to Atlantia.

Greetings, my lady Awilda.

All SCA groups are officially defined in terms of ZIP codes.  Each
groups covers a given set of ZIP codes, and its boundaries are the
boundaries of that region.  The Kingdom Seneschal should have a full
listing of the ZIP codes for each group, so you can probably get all
the info you need from that source.  Most good local maps show ZIP
code boundaries; if not, I believe the post office can supply a
complete map.  

The question of what to do with WV is indeed a cofusing one.
Currently, the WV groups have a month to decide whether or not they
wish to join the incipient principality.  If they decide not to, then
there will be two options: Get BMDL to cede ZIP codes along the
southern edge of PA, to create a Land bridge between WV and the rest
of the East, or to re-assign WV to other Kingdoms.  There has been
some very unofficial, speculative, please-don't-take-this-too
-seriously talk about having some of WV go over to the Middle and some
to Atlantia, but nothing has been decided yet.  

Personally, I find the BoD's requirement that each group be contiguous
silly.  Why does it matter?

Re:  Western use of Thrusting Tips and Shield Size.

The West (I believe) has allways allowed thrusting tips.  At least
for the last 10 years, I think since forever.  However, while they
have been common, they have never been "the norm".  i.e. most
fighters don't use them, but if you get to 6-7th round at a Crown
List you probably had to fight at least once vs. a thrusting tip.

We don't use the "touch you're dead" school of face thrusts (seems
kind of silly to me).  I don't think you'll ever get Westerners to
accept shots that hit the bars on their help, that are 3" away from
their face.  Basically, a thrust needs to be "solid", but not a
strong as a normal attack.

Also, most of the thrusting tips are attached to shortswords or
greatswords, etc., but not usually to a broadsword.  Attaching a
thrusting tip to a broadsword causes it to become "less useful",
i.e. balance gets thrown off, etc.

Even in wars, where A LOT of thrusting tips are found, they are very
rarely attached to broadswords, but you will find A LOT of
shortswords, axes, maces, polearms, pikes, etc., with them.

As to fighting quality:  (warning: don't take this personally)  My
opinion is that the problem stems from the training.  Basically,
TRAIN YOUR NEW FIGHTERS WITH BROADSWORDS (WITHOUT THRUSTING TIPS),
and don't let them have thrusting tips until they are well versed in
the basics.  Just like you don't teach "the rap" until you have
taught "the snap".

This won't stop new fighters from putting thrusting tips on their
weapons, but if all your training is directed at using "the edge"
they will quickly learn to leave them off, until you show them how
to use them.  With Squires, and other members of a Knight's
Household, this shouldn't be a problem, just say NO.

Here in the West (or at least in the Mists) most new fighters get
trained with broadswords and 24" round shields.  After they have
been trained in the basics (about the time the round shield breaks)
they should know enough about fighting to decide what weapon/shield
they want to specialize in.  As I said, there isn't anything
stopping a new fighter from using a thrusting tip, but they will
have trouble finding anyone to teach them how to use it.

Re:  "Basic Training" of new fighters.  In the Mists, new fighters
are usually trained in groups.  Starting with "slow work" until they
have armor built, and then progressing through various stages of
training.  The new fighters are basically "segregated" from the
experienced fighters, unless one of the experienced fighters is
training one of them.  i.e. the trainees are at one end of the
fighter practice, and the experienced fighters at the other.

This allows the experienced fighters "to avoid" training new
fighters (on any specific day), if they want.  And, also, keeps the
trainees from being "pounded" on.  Many of the experienced fighters
will spend part of practice with the trainees, and then move to the
other end, to fight "tough" opponents.

This may only work as the "BART Bash" practice on Thursdays usually
has a lot of fighters (i.e. 20) on a good day, so it can basically
be two fighter practices.  Tuesdays, at "BART", is basically for new
fighters, and is more of organized "training" (with fewer
experienced fighters).  Also, on Tuesdays and Sundays, we have the
"Mission College" fighter practice, which is similiar to BART, but
smaller.

Also, there have been true "newbie classes" held on off days, which
are strictly for teaching basics.  The classes vary depending on the
teacher (i.e. limited class size, etc.).

I would be interested in hearing how training is done in other
places.  Especially, those places with radically different fighting
styles (i.e. you guys up in An Tir, I've been to some of your
fighter practices.  But everyone else hasn't.).  Enough of this.

Re:  Shield sizes.  I've allways thought limiting shield sizes was
silly (similiar the limiting thrusting as silly).  The "official"
rules (whatever that means) allready limit shields in that the can't
be constructed using modern materials that give "excessive
advantage", i.e. clear plastic shields, etc.  This "rule" could
reasonably be used to limit shields that have too low a "density",
i.e. wieght/square foot.

One of these days I'm going to build a tourney legal stretched
leather shield, to see how much it weighs, and how it works.  But it
will be a while.

In the West, which has no limitations on shield size, the most
common shields (for tourneys) are:

        1)  Heaters:  Size:  Approx 22-24" wide by 32-36" tall, some
        curved, some flat.  (I may not have the size exactly right
        since I don't use one.)
        2)  Round Shields:  Size:  24" (some variance, but most
        round shields in the west are 24")
        3)  "Radnor Rounds":  Size:  24" by 24".  (there is some
        variance, usually in length)  A "Radnor Round" is square on
        the top, and round on the bottom.  i.e. take a 24 by 24
        square, and cut the two bottom corners off, round, but leave
        the top two as is.  The style is similiar to "agressive"
        round shield, i.e. punch blocking, not rotating.  The shield
        style was made popular by Duke Sir Radnor of Gildemar (sp?).
        It is also know as a "Bunny Round", i.e. a round shield
        with ears.

There are a few other shield types seen, but not many (i.e.
bucklers, or Norman Kites).  I keep threatening to use my war kite
(24 by 48, rounded, pointed bottom) and a shortsword, but I haven't
yet.  (I did use a 18" by 36" flat kite for a while.)  I HATE
fighting big shields, but I don't think that should stop them from
being used.  My Knight (and many other Knights I've talked to) LIKE
to fight big shields, since they are slower than smaller shields.
Oh well, one of these days I'll be "fast" and then I'll probably
like to fight them too!

Enough for now.

Message-Id: <2515@lindy.Stanford.EDU>

I have a BIG question, regarding the "problem" of West Virginia (?)
being non-contiguous with the non-Principality portions of the East.

So what, big deal...

The new Principality is part of the East, correct?  So what if the
non-Principality portions of the East are on opposite sides of the
Principality?

Out here in the West, the northern part of the "Marches" are
non-contiguous from the southern part.  i.e. the Principalities of
the Mists, and Cynagua seperate them.  Unless you count the Pacific
Ocean as connecting them.  And until recently, Oertha (Alaska), was
seperated by another Kingdom (An Tir), unless of course you count
the ocean again.  (Oertha is now a Principality)

Note:  It is 11 hours, by car, from the "Northern Marches" to the
"Southern Marches" (via the SF Bay Area).

And I'm not even going to bring up Australia or Japan...

I couldn't agree with you more, my lord Etienne.  However, the BoD, in
their often-questionable wisdom, will not permit the creation of a
Principality which cuts off part of a Kingdom from the rest.  I don't
see any logic to it, but they will not be swayed.

Well, my lord (and you should take this in the friendly manner in
which it is intended), the BoD has always considered the West to be
special.  There are LOTS of cases where the West got to do something,
but some other Kingdom has not been allowed to.  And they wonders why
we Easterners don't much care for the BoD!

Personally, I want an Emperor, but that's another heresy.

Good cheer!

Or we could discuss how to ignore BoD policies successfully (and

This has been an interesting discussion.  William, I would like to thank
you for your comments.  I have found them on this and other issues to be
very thought-provoking.

I'm afraid I have to disagree with your viewpoint in this instance.
Witches have been more frequently evil, true, but this is not universally
the case.  Particularly in this decade people read about sorcery and its
uses in a positive sense.  Most high school level history discussion on
witchcraft (say, in the Middle Ages) does in fact stress that the typical
image of a witch came from the appearance and mannerisms of those women
who lived to an unusual age.

If they survived years of childbirth, women lived longer than men (which
is why witch is identified as female).  With no dental care, the teeth fall
out, leading to the hooked nose and protruding chin effect - it's really
from missing teeth.  Wrinkles and sparse white hair, along with other
signs of age (age is not exactly pretty to the young), complete the look.

Looking so different, and seemingly having cheated death, these women were
off to a bad start.  Add to that a possible crabbiness from being old,
possibly arthritic, and most likely alone in the world.  Now increase that
crabbiness with the natural resentment stemming from being mistrusted due
to age and appearance, and you have a very bad-tempered old lady.  I'm sure
this isn't new to anyone; I'm just saying this is what lots people are
taught.

Any history lesson at the States that covers the Salem witch trials debunks
the accusations of witchcraft that were hurled around so freely.

In other words, lots of people learn (at an impressionable age) that
so-called witches are more likely ordinary misunderstood humans.  (Which
doesn't do much for their reputation in the modern world - people tend
not to believe in them.)

Science fiction and fantasy readers get still another viewpoint - that of
people of real power who use it for good - and who strongly disapprove of
those who use it for evil.  Power in fantasy frequently destroys those who
misuse it.

Even those who don't read SF or fantasy, and who don't cover historical
witchcraft in school still can have their opinions affected - hordes of
people have seen the Wizard of Oz (or read the book - but I counted them
under readers above) - Glenda, remember?  The Good Witch?

Before anyone beats me to it, I will stay that the dictionary definition
of witch (Webster's II, New Riverside University Dictionary, 1984 - my
employer bought it, not me - I'll check my OED when I get home) does say
a woman who practices black magic, not magic.  (Black magic is defined
further along as magic in league with the Devil.)  There are definitions
of other words (magic, for one) which do not imply evil, but this is not
one of them.  (The secondary definition is an ugly, vicious old woman -
in line with the comments on middle ages above.)

I still think that the common understanding of the term is such that
the possibility of good uses of power is part of the word.  That's one
person's opinion.  I think the above examples are enough to show that
the term has not been redefined by a small group of intellectuals somewhere,
but rather by a large mass of population, over a lengthy period of time.

Subject: expectations, and the disappointment thereof (was RE:  witches)

This is a very long posting.  I apologize for that in advance.  I also
get the list in digest form, so I know how much of a pain it is to
read through pages of a long message that you don't find interesting,
just to get to the next message.  I hope this gets posted at the end
of a digest.

I didn't mean to get this long.  Please let me know if you think the
length or content of this message is inappropriate.  I wax a little
eloquent, but I believe my points are relevant.  (Believe me, I do -
otherwise I wouldn't post this.)

William de Corbie wrote in an earlier posting that those who flaunt their
differences should expect to be ostracized or harassed by the general
populace.  (My apologies to William if I've mistated his views for the
sake of brevity.)

At first, I agreed with his statement.  It really makes a lot of sense.
On further reflection, however, I don't agree that those are realistic
expectations for the cross-section of the US population that reads this
list.  Please note that I'm speaking in generalities here.  I'm sure that
there are US readers who have had personal experience or education that
leads them to these expectations.

For the most part, however, there is a common set of characteristics
which define the members of this group - and those characteristics lead
this group to expect tolerance of other viewpoints.  Please note that
I will only address US demographics - I don't have enough information
about SCA-list readers outside the US.

For example, the US readers on this list are technology freaks - or
married or related or close friends with someone who is.  The evidence?
A computer link which allows the list to be read, and sufficient
familiarity with mailing systems and networks to gain access.

Computer literacy leads us to education - I would bet that most of
the readers on this list are college educated.  Many are still in school,
some are working for companies technologically oriented enough to
provide network access to their employees.  A college education in the
US leads one to the water of tolerance.  Some would say it even tries
to make you drink.

Not only do the professors encourage critical thinking and recognition
of other viewpoints (no flames, please - I'll bet that at least one
professor in the four years that a hypothetical student spends in college
was both motivated to do the above and managed to reach that student),
but also the environment encourages tolerance.  For the first time (for
many students), there are new people around, people who talk differently,
and act differently, and dress differently, and think differently.

Some high school students (or even elementary school, while we're regressing)
get the same kind of exposure.  Racial and cultural mixing takes place
in many schools far more than in the workplace or at home.

For the benefit of those outside the US, elementary school is grades 1-8,
ages 6-13.  High school is grades 9-12, ages 14-17.  Sometimes, grades
7 and 8 or grades 7-9 are called middle school (ages 12-13 or 12-14).  Keep
those pubescent kids off by themselves, where they can't wreak too much
damage.

The standard four years of college after high school (if you went at all)
is losing ground, though is still (I think) the most common.  That would
be ages 18-21.  Lots of people skip grades, or wait a few years between
high school and college, or take off a year or so in the middle, or stretch
it out to 5 years, working alternate terms.  Also, lots of people who
quit school many years ago are returning.  About a third of my college
was older people coming back to school - I was in school with my mother,
for heavens sake.

Sorry for the digression - I just wanted to be clear.  Comparative
scholasticism can be confusing.  So much for education (in case you'd
forgotten the topic by now).

Technophilia and education combine to make it quite likely that most
readers are also science fictions fans.  Nothing (that I can think of
at the moment - anyone want to saw off this branch?) is more intrinsically
tolerant of other viewpoints than science fiction.  It is very hard to
be an SF fan and not begin to sign on to the belief that other viewpoints
are valid.  (It is possible to be a hardened technocrat, only reading
hard SF, and retaining a narrow viewpoint.  It is not common.)

Now look at the effect of SCA membership.  Let's face it, the people
we meet in this group are a little weird.  Lots of members are misfits
in society (don't take this personally - just count the ones you know).
Escapism is one of the reasons people join this group ... and people
escape in lots of different ways.  Group members learn to tolerate and
even enjoy differences in the people around them.

In short :-), the environment of most of the US readers of this digest
has accustomed them to the idea of tolerance for other viewpoints; to
tolerate other people's differences and to expect the same in return.

Those of us who have experienced racism or sexism or "jingoism" or any
other "sectism" have had our expectations lowered (at least a little),
but we are few.  The readers of this group are, for the most part, young.
The civil rights movement and the women's liberation movement have wrought
many changes in our culture, but most of the struggle was before our time -
certainly the more violent aspects.  Blatant discrimination has in large
part gone underground.  Many, if not most, blatant acts are quite illegal.
Subtle discrimination is still quite rampant - but we are not attuned to
seeing it.

We don't see discrimination, and so we don't expect it.  We expect people
to behave in a tolerant and non-discriminatory fashion.  I don't think
this is a bad thing.  People tend to live up to other's expectations of
them.

For examples of the expectations of others affecting behavior, look at
schools - the expectations of the teacher have a bearing on the performance
of the students.  The same kind of effect is visible with parents and
children.  Look at little closer to home, at fellow members of the SCA.
When a group expects chivalry, the individual members of that group
behave more chivalrously.

The first time your expectations are seriously let down, either by the
action of an individual in a serious breach or by the collective actions
of a group in a less serious breach (I mean, it would seem less serious
if it were the act of an individual), the foundation of your world is
shaken.  Nothing has prepared you for unjust behavior on the basis of
a silly category, or on any basis other than personal dislike (which is
accepted if deplored as an individual breach of expectations).

This shattering of your world view is bad enough, without the added
strain that I see in the story that started this discussion.  (I'm sorry,
I wasn't going to follow up, so I didn't save that posting.)

Most of us in the group as described, in addition to the rose-colored
glasses we wear about people, have an optimism about the fairness of
government.  The age group represented doesn't have the same need to
rebel against authority that the previous generation (?) did.  Most of
us consider our government to be in fact of the people, by the people,
for the people.  Those few of us who have had run-ins with various
government branches, such as the IRS, know this is not the case.  However,
because of the collective age of the group, these are again few.

To have the prejudices of one intolerant community and their desire for
oppression and harassment aided and abetted by the very forces we expect
to defend our rights to freedoms of expression and lifestyle is an
absolute nightmare.

To the pagan who posted the tale, and to all those who have experienced
any such form of oppression or harassment ... you have lost your
innocence, and it can never be reclaimed.  I beg of you, please don't
let that loss lower your expectations for other people's behavior.  We
cannot lower the standard of tolerance, or chivalry, for who will raise
it up again?

Subject: Thrusting tips and Helmet padding

Thrusting tips:  *very*, no, make that **VERY** common here in Atlantia.
Almost everyone has them on everything possible.  Face thrusts are currently
allowed at all times (tournament and melee), with a touch sufficient
to kill - we aren't trying to rock someone's head back.  The current
king, His Majesty Barry, has asked for comment on banning face thrusts
from single combat - there is an opinion that seems widely held that
the average skill level of fighters has been dropping recently, due
to the overuse of the face thrust - lots of new fighters aren't
learning to throw useful blows because of the perception that a
face thrust is easier to get in.  It also seems to have the advantage
of being proof against rhino-hiding - if it touches your faceplate
below your eyebrows, it is supposed to be accepted.  Since lots of
people blink when something comes directly at their face, it is
accepted practice to ask a marshall if the tip touched face - so
new fighters may think that they don't have to learn to swing a
good blow if they learn to face thrust.  I've spent many years in
the Middle kingdom, where there is no face thrust, and it does seem
the "average skill level" argument may have some validity.  Of
course, the shields used here average much bigger than those in the
Middle (crown legal in the middle == 26" largest dimension, varies
in Atlantia, last crown was 34" (I think - maybe 32)) which has a
serious effect on the usefulness of some kinds of blows and on the
thrusting tip.  (As a side note, the next crown has no limit on
the size of shields, but they must weigh 2 1/2 pounds per square
foot -- figure it out - a steel round at 24" just barely makes the
minimum -- lots of people should be in for a surprise :-) !!)

Helmet padding:  I use duct tape rolled into a loop on the padding
instead of glue -- lots easier to remove if I want to for either
helmet repair or padding replacement.  Don't forget that a legal
option is a suspension harness mounted in the helm, rather than
padding (at least by society standards its legal, possibly not in
some kingdoms).  The people I know that use harness say that it
lets them breathe and hear much better, and is lots cooler too.  The
disadvantage is that the helmet may tend to ring a lot without padding
to deaden it.

Subject: religion, witchcraft, etc.

Unto the gentil readers of the rialto, Li Kung Lo once again sends greetings!
It has been a long time since I have gotten my digests (thanks Jane and
Justin), and it seems you have been having this great, although becoming
repetitious, discussion of pagan religion, and the treatment of religion in
the SCA. Well, before this whole thing is over, I'd like a chance to put in my
two cent's worth.
        Thanks to Awilda Halfdane (blessed be, sister), Cher de Bellevue,
Samuel Basset, Meow, and of course, William de Corbie for their thought
provoking comments. While I cannot truly shed light on this, I can share my
own experiences, as both an ethnologist/archeologist (I gave up that line to
go into nursing), and as a pagan raised to traditional craft initiation.
        Milord de Corbie, I take issue with your version of religious history,
and I am disappointed by your narrow view of religious persecution. For a
discussion of the relationship between Christian and Pagan religions during
the middle ages, try *The Spiral Dance*, *The White Goddess*, *Drawing Down
the Moon*, *The Women's Encyclopedia of Myths and Goddesses*, and other
relevent works. 
        Your statement that there are observed regularities in social change
(paraphrase- It conflicts with what we know about social change...) is mostly
mistaken. We have studied social process for about 100 years in an ever more
rigorous manner, and we know almost nothing about it. Such historical
phenomenon as the vowel shift in the English language elude our explanation
completely. By prior "laws" of lexicostatistics (a branch of linguistic
anthropology dealing with statistical analysis of language change over time)
the English vowel shift should have taken 600-1000 years (actually, it was
about 80).
        Moreover, pagan religion is not organized along the lines of most
modern religions, and therefore does not change in the same way. Oral
traditions are not the same as written traditions, and bronze age politics
aren't corporate. The idea that modern Norse paganism can be compared to
"known facts" about ancient Norse religion assumes that their was a "standard"
set of religious beliefs and practices to be referred to, like a Christian
creed and liturgy, but this is not true. Traditional religion far more likely
varied between regions, households, sexes, social classes, and family groups
as much as it does with the practices of modern Norse Pagans.
        I will grant as a given that most modern Norse Pagans have drawn the
majority, if not all, of their beliefs and practices from written sources
describing ancient Norse customs. However, the idea of a secret religious
practice is *not* ridiculous. By conservative estimates, between the years of
1450 and 1670, 5-7 million people were tortured and put to death as witches by
the Christian churches of Europe and their secular representatives, the
majority of them women. (see *Gyn-Ecology* by Mary Daly on the burning times)
During this dark period, many of the local pagan practices which had survived
the early Christianization of Europe went out of sight, along with midwifery,
hypnosis/suggestion, herbalism, animal training techniques, native
toxicology/pharmacology, and a host of other skills which comprised the core
of the craft.
        When I was 8 years old, and I went to public school, the teacher asked
me, "What religion are you, Richie?", and I answered, "none", because I knew
it was better than facing the ridicule, laughter, and possible injury that
would result from telling the truth. Today in 1989, I work in a Seventh-Day
Adventist Hospital, and refuse to work on any of the sabbats. I wear my
pentagram proudly, and teach about paganism to any *interested* party. 
        Milord de Corbie, the violation of someone's civil rights, regardless
of the popularity or lack therof of their beliefs, is never deserved, and to
decry the crimes of those who would deny those rights (even Jews attacking
Naziists) is not "whining". 
        Our religion, or "craft", because religion is only a component of it,
is an ancient one, an oral tradition practiced under the stars, and in the oak
groves of ancient forests. It usually has no houses of worship, no corporate
entity, no real estate, no taxes, no tithes, no creed, and no visibility. It
is practiced by small groups of people, whose beliefs vary widely from group
to group, as do our rituals. Mostly we have in common only the idea that
there is a female quality (a goddess) in creation, distinct and separate from
the male quality. Some of us worship the two, some just the goddess, and
some many gods. Many of us can recite the act of contrition as readily as a
fervent Catholic, and many, like myself, were born to it, and are the
recipients of an oral tradition whose age even we cannot guess.
        The important thing here is what relevence all this has to the SCA,
and hence this forum. It is my belief that you have beaten this dead horse
long enough that inspires me to make this long (sorry) posting. You see, as
far apart as we might seem, (Christian minister and Pagan Priest), it would
seem that Milord de Corbie and myself are mostly in agreement. We both have a
love of ancient times, and the SCA. We are both basically tolerant of other
people's beliefs. (If you want to have high mass at an SCA event, go for it.
My *Christian* persona will happily chime in.) Furthermore, we seem to agree
that as long as there are people who lack such tolerance, the avoidance of
religious and ritualistic behavior at SCA events is a necessary thing. Not
only does it avoid certain PR problems, but prevents infighting, factionalism,
and possibly even violence between my Scadian brothers and sisters.

                                        In Service to the SCA and
                                             The Horned God,

Once again, gentles, an important non-Christian religion has been
forgotten.  It was present during the period in question, survived
in the face of oft-times brutal repression, and existed throughout
Europe.  I am refering of course to Judaism.  Spain, Portugal, England,
and others tried to eliminate it from time to time by forced conversion,
expulsion, and extermination yet it survived.  More to the point Jewish
communities have been discovered as recently as five years ago in Portugal and 
South America which practised their religion in secrecy, complete secrecy.
Talmud and Torah have been passed down _intact_ (that's the first five
books of the Bible plus 63 volumes of Talmud) pretty much from memory.
These Jews though they were the only ones left in the world. Yes, this is
documented 'scientifically'.  In fact the rabbi at the synagogue I attend 
was involved in the rediscovery of a couple such communities.  With this
as an example I find it entirely possible that other religious traditions
survived that advent of Christianity as well.

Good Evening,
    I encourage you to write the letter of reccomendation for the person with
the somewhat annoying personality. The award you are talking about from what I
understand is kingdom service, from what you wrote it is blatently obvious that
the person in question has done true service to your group. I must ask you what
right does your group has to determine the (im)morality of an individual's
actions? I have met several people in the society with rather non-mainstream
attitudes, including those who have group or open marriages, what they do, 
provided it does not directly concern you (i.e. no passes made at you) is none 
of your business. The most important point you mention is the scaring away of 
newcomers, I am terribly afraid that it happens, people whose lifestyle is 
different from the norm do tend to frighten mundanes. There are however many 
people like your description in the society and if they are frightened by the 
person you mentioned than what will their reaction be to others they meet from 
outside your group? It should be pointed out, in fairly strong terms, to the 
person you are refering to, that his/her actions are causing a disturbace to 
some and that it is discourteous to force their morality on others, just as 
discourteous as for others to force their morality on them.
    I strongly reccomend that write the letter of reccomendation, for the
service award if for service, and from what you said they do indeed deserve it
if they are as helpful as you say.
    I also reccomend that you talk to them, and as they have shown signs of
trying to change I am extreamly hopeful, changing a pattern of behaivior is
extreamly difficult and takes time.

Umm..., face thrusting is legal in _any_ tourney if anounced ahead of time.
It is _forbidden_ in this Crown by Morguhn (He'll be king then). The rules
are an experiment and are _very_ limited. The tournement must be
announced as having face thrusting, a new authorization is needed, it may
only be used in single combat, and both parties must be authorised and
agreeable. Sound conservative experimentation.

I find the forcing of a smaller shield at crown more interesting. I recently
made a "big" shield (20" x 30" heater vs my old 24" target) and was asked if
it was my new "small for crown" shield! Sheesh!

Well, I've been quiet for a while and this lets me post without getting too
viament.

For a long time, I had no use for thrusting tips. Not for the reasons stated
in Mike's area, but simply because I hadn't figured out how to use them. If
I have to think to do a technique, I'll almost never use it. I still don't
have them on my broad swords. I don't feel they would be effective against
the "convention*" body armour, the East has only just allowed (limited) face
thrusting, and, as I said above, I am not practiced in the moves, so I
wouldn't use them most of the time anyway. (Just what I need, another way
for my weapons/armour to fail! ;-)

That being said, on a polearm, bastard sword, or great-sword thrusting tips
are... well... great! They offer a whole new dimension in ways to "reach
out and touch someone!":-) With a six foot weapon I can hit a target at
8.5+ feet on a lunge, or 7.5 without full extention but easily followed by
a quick close to toe to toe. Never fails to amaze your friends ;-).

As to the objections of the group you are in now (Where is that, BTW?),
it sounds like they would have a problem anyway. You have to know where the
rattan ends to hit someone, and if the thrusting tip is "robbing" them, they
need to rethink range. As I've previously opined, the tip is not what you
want to strike with anyway.  Even though it is the fastest moving part of
the weapon, it is the most easily deflected, and is not likely to defeat
"convention" armour and incapacitate your opponent.

If you live in one of those areas where folks stand at extreme range behind
huge shields and only throw tip shots (e.g. the East), I can see their
objection. I've been to too many tournements where this was standard. It
gets to sounding like a diet beer commercial about waiters with all the
"lights", "lows", and "tips" being called ;-). Besides, it's hard to get
around those shields with a bastard sword;-)(Ah ha! the real reason! ;-).
Although I have had to inform opponents that they could get up if they
wanted to, "It was only a tip." ;-)

Subject: Awards (in Response to Enid's discussion about awards vs attitude)

Good Baroness, and people of the Rialto --
 
In reading Enid's posting several similar but different situations
came to mind, and one of the most common is that of the fighter who
is extraordinarily good, has talent in several other areas, and
whose attitudes about chivalry and, particularly, knighthood, stink.
I've known several of these folk, and it occurs to me that the
Chivalry are particularly good at finding someone who can go up to
this person and say "Listen, we think you're a great fighter, and a
talented burble-maker, but if your attitude doesn't improve you're
going to find yourself never getting any further in the SCA." Now,
perhaps this capitalizes on the person's lust for "danglies", but it
seems to me that in some cases, at least, the possible recipient
isn't aware of the problems that he/she is causing, and some frank
assessment by a trusted friend is in order.
 
It's been said in my hearing that Pelicans don't have to be nice/
chivalrous/ pleasant/ or courteous, they just have to get lots of
work done. I, personally, think this is a wrong idea, and we should
be encouraging the appropriate sorts of behaviors at all levels. On
the one hand, I agree with the folks who say that we should reward
good behavior and not negatively reinforce the bad, but sometimes
you find folks who are so oblivious to life around them that you
have to speak bluntly.
 
Remember the old saying about mules and 2x4's -- 
    "first, you have to get his attention...."

Subject: Ask the Rialto

    1) I am just starting fighting, and therefore am also curious
    about the popularity/ lack of same of thrusting tips.  Since I
    have yet to develop a 'style', I'd like to know if thrusting and
    defense against it are something to try to develop.  

    (As an aside, what do Eastrealmers think of the new face-thrusting
    rules for Crown Tourney?)

For what it's worth, one fighter's opinions about thrusting.  I don't do it -
not because I think it's not chivalrous (the people who thrust at my stomach
invariably find my cup...), not because I think it isn't period (broadswords
were used to smash and hack, not stab), but because it is a gimmic.  I try to
concentrate on simple, direct attacks, and simple, tight defense.  If you can't
master "the basics" then the more complicated moves will forever escape you. I
am too busy blocking my opponents blows and throwing my own, to look for "that
special opening" which would allow a good thrust.  Thus, I don't even put
thrusting tips on my swords.

His Royal Highness Morguhn has specifically BANNED face thrusting from Spring
Crownt Tourney, which is, by the way, in Lakewood, New Jersey (the Barony of
Carillion) on May 13th.

   Best solution I've seen that avoids glue or double-sided tape is one used
by John the Artificer, from our area.  He put together a flight-cap style hat
(aka "Snoopy and The Red Court Baron" style) with the padding attached
to _it_, in pads and tubes.  He puts this on, then puts on the helmet over it.
The helmet proper has _no_ padding in it, just a chin strap.  This way he
can remove the padding, wash it (oh my, to be able to do that with mine!),
modify it, etc., without tearing things out of the helm.  Makes banging dings

Good Evening,
    I encourage you to write the letter of reccomendation for the person with
the somewhat annoying personality. The award you are talking about from what I
understand is kingdom service, from what you wrote it is blatently obvious that
the person in question has done true service to your group. I must ask you what
right does your group has to determine the (im)morality of an individual's
actions? I have met several people in the society with rather non-mainstream
attitudes, including those who have group or open marriages, what they do, 
provided it does not directly concern you (i.e. no passes made at you) is none 
of your business. The most important point you mention is the scaring away of 
newcomers, I am terribly afraid that it happens, people whose lifestyle is 
different from the norm do tend to frighten mundanes. There are however many 
people like your description in the society and if they are frightened by the 
person you mentioned than what will their reaction be to others they meet from 
outside your group? It should be pointed out, in fairly strong terms, to the 
person you are refering to, that his/her actions are causing a disturbace to 
some and that it is discourteous to force their morality on others, just as 
discourteous as for others to force their morality on them.
    I strongly reccomend that write the letter of reccomendation, for the
service award if for service, and from what you said they do indeed deserve it
if they are as helpful as you say.
    I also reccomend that you talk to them, and as they have shown signs of
trying to change I am extreamly hopeful, changing a pattern of behaivior is
extreamly difficult and takes time.

Umm..., face thrusting is legal in _any_ tourney if anounced ahead of time.
It is _forbidden_ in this Crown by Morguhn (He'll be king then). The rules
are an experiment and are _very_ limited. The tournement must be
announced as having face thrusting, a new authorization is needed, it may
only be used in single combat, and both parties must be authorised and
agreeable. Sound conservative experimentation.

I find the forcing of a smaller shield at crown more interesting. I recently
made a "big" shield (20" x 30" heater vs my old 24" target) and was asked if
it was my new "small for crown" shield! Sheesh!

Well, I've been quiet for a while and this lets me post without getting too
viament.

For a long time, I had no use for thrusting tips. Not for the reasons stated
in Mike's area, but simply because I hadn't figured out how to use them. If
I have to think to do a technique, I'll almost never use it. I still don't
have them on my broad swords. I don't feel they would be effective against
the "convention*" body armour, the East has only just allowed (limited) face
thrusting, and, as I said above, I am not practiced in the moves, so I
wouldn't use them most of the time anyway. (Just what I need, another way
for my weapons/armour to fail! ;-)

That being said, on a polearm, bastard sword, or great-sword thrusting tips
are... well... great! They offer a whole new dimension in ways to "reach
out and touch someone!":-) With a six foot weapon I can hit a target at
8.5+ feet on a lunge, or 7.5 without full extention but easily followed by
a quick close to toe to toe. Never fails to amaze your friends ;-).

As to the objections of the group you are in now (Where is that, BTW?),
it sounds like they would have a problem anyway. You have to know where the
rattan ends to hit someone, and if the thrusting tip is "robbing" them, they
need to rethink range. As I've previously opined, the tip is not what you
want to strike with anyway.  Even though it is the fastest moving part of
the weapon, it is the most easily deflected, and is not likely to defeat
"convention" armour and incapacitate your opponent.

If you live in one of those areas where folks stand at extreme range behind
huge shields and only throw tip shots (e.g. the East), I can see their
objection. I've been to too many tournements where this was standard. It
gets to sounding like a diet beer commercial about waiters with all the
"lights", "lows", and "tips" being called ;-). Besides, it's hard to get
around those shields with a bastard sword;-)(Ah ha! the real reason! ;-).
Although I have had to inform opponents that they could get up if they
wanted to, "It was only a tip." ;-)

   I have returned from a much-deserved vacation, and, as usual, I

Milord, why do you have so much trouble with the idea of a completely 
hidden religion?  Do you think everyone enjoys getting their butts 
kicked?  Wouldn't "science" or the community *protect* them in the 
name of knowledge?  No?  Well, why in (insert favorite diety here)'s
name would they tell anyone, anywhere, anywhen who or what they believe???
In your own words why would anyone be "so stupid"????

Subject: Awards (in Response to Enid's discussion about awards vs attitude)

Good Baroness, and people of the Rialto --
 
In reading Enid's posting several similar but different situations
came to mind, and one of the most common is that of the fighter who
is extraordinarily good, has talent in several other areas, and
whose attitudes about chivalry and, particularly, knighthood, stink.
I've known several of these folk, and it occurs to me that the
Chivalry are particularly good at finding someone who can go up to
this person and say "Listen, we think you're a great fighter, and a
talented burble-maker, but if your attitude doesn't improve you're
going to find yourself never getting any further in the SCA." Now,
perhaps this capitalizes on the person's lust for "danglies", but it
seems to me that in some cases, at least, the possible recipient
isn't aware of the problems that he/she is causing, and some frank
assessment by a trusted friend is in order.
 
It's been said in my hearing that Pelicans don't have to be nice/
chivalrous/ pleasant/ or courteous, they just have to get lots of
work done. I, personally, think this is a wrong idea, and we should
be encouraging the appropriate sorts of behaviors at all levels. On
the one hand, I agree with the folks who say that we should reward
good behavior and not negatively reinforce the bad, but sometimes
you find folks who are so oblivious to life around them that you
have to speak bluntly.
 
Remember the old saying about mules and 2x4's -- 
    "first, you have to get his attention...."

Subject: Ask the Rialto

    1) I am just starting fighting, and therefore am also curious
    about the popularity/ lack of same of thrusting tips.  Since I
    have yet to develop a 'style', I'd like to know if thrusting and
    defense against it are something to try to develop.  

    (As an aside, what do Eastrealmers think of the new face-thrusting
    rules for Crown Tourney?)

For what it's worth, one fighter's opinions about thrusting.  I don't do it -
not because I think it's not chivalrous (the people who thrust at my stomach
invariably find my cup...), not because I think it isn't period (broadswords
were used to smash and hack, not stab), but because it is a gimmic.  I try to
concentrate on simple, direct attacks, and simple, tight defense.  If you can't
master "the basics" then the more complicated moves will forever escape you. I
am too busy blocking my opponents blows and throwing my own, to look for "that
special opening" which would allow a good thrust.  Thus, I don't even put
thrusting tips on my swords.

His Royal Highness Morguhn has specifically BANNED face thrusting from Spring
Crownt Tourney, which is, by the way, in Lakewood, New Jersey (the Barony of
Carillion) on May 13th.

   Best solution I've seen that avoids glue or double-sided tape is one used
by John the Artificer, from our area.  He put together a flight-cap style hat
(aka "Snoopy and The Red Court Baron" style) with the padding attached
to _it_, in pads and tubes.  He puts this on, then puts on the helmet over it.
The helmet proper has _no_ padding in it, just a chin strap.  This way he
can remove the padding, wash it (oh my, to be able to do that with mine!),
modify it, etc., without tearing things out of the helm.  Makes banging dings
out of ones hat easier, too, I would suppose.

Good Evening,
    My good lord DeCorbie, I had to take a breath or two when I read one of
your recent postings. If you are suggesting that it is wrong to take a stand 
on a  position that is not popular than I fear that you are gravely mistaken,
and would point to your Martin Luther as a perfect example. However if you are
suggesting that it is wrong to flaunt your differentness, I will agree that it
is naive to not expect trouble, even though according to most laws in our
country you should be able to. There is a vast difference between what should
be and what is, you should be able to believe and do what ever you want with
out being hassled (providing you don't hurt anyone else), this is part of my
definiton of liberty and a vital portion of what i consider the "Dream".
      I apologize for posting this to the net, My mailer refuses to believe you
exist.

Good Evening,
    A whole bunch of little questions,

What do you think of thrusting tips?
   In my current location thrusting tips are not terribly popular, the standard
argument being that they result in marginal shots made with the end of the
blade not being called. In other areas I live almost no-one fought w/o such
tips. 

Can anyone tell me about any groups located in and around Tucson Az.? It
appears that I will be spending my summer there and would like some information
about who to contact and such.

What is the best yeast to use when making mead? In specific cysers, I have met
people who swear by something (my memory fades at this point "rit" something?)
My experience is primarily with ales and lagers and while I have helped do
a couple of Meads this will be my first full forray into non-grain potables.

Is etched glass a period artform?
   I have recently been introduced to glass etching am enjoying it, while I
doubt that sand etched would be period what about acid etching?

Does anyone know of any books that cover in any detail at all Scotland in
particular and england in general around 1540 or so? Anything that has fairly 
accurate description of dress would be especially appreciated.

Many many more but my Mind has totally lost it lately.

     Once again my comment is a little late for the topic, but I felt it could
be useful. When someone new makes a chain shirt, they may not realize just how
appallingly heavy they can be. When I read about 12 gauge chain I cringe. We
were very fortunate to have a weapons collector visit one of our events in
pittsburgh recently. He has several authentic pieces of chain armor, much of it
rivited(!). I think none of it was bigger than 1/4" with 16 ga. wire. I will
have to look him up someday to measure it carefully.
     I know that a finer mesh of chain means more work, but people might
consider it more authentic as well as lighter to wear. There is a guy in the
pittsburgh area making a 3/16" with 18 ga. wire shirt.  That kind of work may
sound crazy, but if you want good working gauntlets that sounds the way to go.
You may recall that the Hospitallers forbade fingered gaunlets as too expensive,
I suspect the cost was due to the fine chain and work required.
     For protection, I also suspect a small ring was good. More links per inch
means more links to break for a point to thrust its way through, although our
butted links don't offer much against a thrust. I am uncertain about the SCA
armor value of chain, although I have participated in some good discussions of
it. Can anyone tell me what is new (about 4 years for me) with their kingdom
marshallate on the value of chain?

    I have a question for the folk of the Rialto.
    If someone in your group has performed a LOT of service...
    What do you do when this person has, over the past years, aroused
    so much hostility in the group...
    This is someone who doesn't conform to the conservative behaviour
    of the group...
    This person's service has been real and valuable....
    The Fret is in the gift of the Crown, of course, yet I realize my
    recommendation would carry some weight.... What do I do?

You have a doozy of a problem there, as those who have already
commented on this matter have noted.  I somewhat agree with Hal Ravn,
who suggested various ways of working with this unfortunate to better
his/her behavior and bring it up to a gentle standard.  But it sounds
like you and those around you are doing or have done this to the
extent that all involved can stand.  If that is the case, perhaps the
following would suit your conscience:
    Write to the Crown.  State all the facts you know, both this
person's extensive service and his or her bad personal behavior.  Give
your argument, or if you will, your ruminations on WHETHER this person
deserves the Purple Fret, based on the facts you have noted.  Include
your ambivalence concerning the situation.
    Then send it off, and let the Crown worry about it; you will have
done your duty by explaining the situation, and by giving all the pros
and cons you know of.  The most important thing is to alert the Crown
that here exists someone who -may- deserve the award; the Crowns of
the East are eternally complaining that they don't know about all the
Eastern folk who deserve awards, which given the size of the East is
undoubtedly true.
    Certainly, if you can stand to give this person further aid and
encouragement to improve his or her behavior, and if s/he can stand to
accept the same, do so.  But don't kill yourself about it; this person
appears to be adult, and so is responsible for his/her own behavior,
however gentle or un-.  Good luck..

From what I understand, the Baroness of Thescorre (Rochester, NY) hired the
fighting force of Myrkfaelinn for a "rub-out job" on a particular person at
a Pennsic War several years ago.  The price was 144 chocolate chip cookies.
Not a "cheap" price in my opinion, considering it took our good Baroness
two years to pay off!

And speaking of chocolate chip cookies, the offer has been made to anyone
wishing to fight for Thescorre in the Thescorre/Stormsport war at Pax this
year of a dozen "serious" chocolate chip cookies.  One serious cookie is
about the equivalent of a dozen regular cookies.  Takers anyone?

in Court at Ice Dragon, but she did announce them in the Principality
meeting before Court.

The incipient Principality includes Coppertree, Delftwood, Thescorre,
Rhydderich Hael, Beau Fleuve, Sterling Vayle, Myrkfaelinn (who voted a
majority "no" but with the caveat that if we went Principality they would
ignore us just as they currently do with the East Kingdom), Stormsport, and
BMDL and surrounding areas.  Negotiations are going to be made with BMDL to
create a land bridge from the rest of the East Kingdom to the groups in
West Virginia, since they voted overwhemingly no.

As an interesting point, Aiden had a 70% return on the polling ballots!
For those of you who don't understand these things, apparently a 20% return
on a polling is usual and expected.  Most groups voted between 3-to-1 and
5-to-1 in favor.

I will try to put the device into heraldese, so forgive me if I goof:
Gules, an escarbuncle (a shield boss that looks a lot like a fancy
snowflake) argent within a laurel wreath and in chief a crown or.  (I don't
know the specifics of the crown).

Heralds in the area are now working on the Princess and Heirs devices
(differencing the above with things like roses and labels) and a badge.  We
also are collecting ideas on the names and badges for the awards (Arts &
Sciences, Martial Arts, and Service) and on ideas for the design of the
Coronets.

If you would like to contribute to the above, send me a mail note to my
address and I will pass your ideas to Sycamore Herald (western
region/principality herald).  You don't have to be a resident of the
principality to contribute (at least, *I* don't think so!).

From what I understand, the Baroness of Thescorre (Rochester, NY) hired the
fighting force of Myrkfaelinn for a "rub-out job" on a particular person at
a Pennsic War several years ago.  The price was 144 chocolate chip cookies.
Not a "cheap" price in my opinion, considering it took our good Baroness
two years to pay off!

And speaking of chocolate chip cookies, the offer has been made to anyone
wishing to fight for Thescorre in the Thescorre/Stormsport war at Pax this
year of a dozen "serious" chocolate chip cookies.  One serious cookie is
about the equivalent of a dozen regular cookies.  Takers anyone?

This is in the nature of a reply to Lord Yaakov Hamizrachiy.

I feel that you are right in your observations about the differences between
natural sciences and humanist scholarship. I would like to add a bit, though:

In the natural sciences, most things are provable by experiment or logics.
This means that it is very difficult to lie and have people believe you.
Also, the knowledge we get through natural sciences seldom touches directly
onout values, morals, beliefs or ways of life. Therefore, there is very 
little incentive to speculate or lie, and you can normally trust what you
read if the author is a respected scientist.

The findings of humanist sciences affect our feelings much more. Since we
seldom get a single, all-covering explanation of any phenomenon in these
sciences, there is always room for different viewpoints and it's wasy to
bend the truth if one wants to. There is also a large incentive for us to
involve our personal opinions in these matters.

This is why the literature on humanist sciences is full of prejudice, wild
guesses, wishful thinking, attempts to exaggerate one explanation while 
omitting another, and even outright lies. And even when the books tell the
truth, we who read them sometimes do not read what is there, but interpret
it according to our own prejudice. The result is that in order to find the
truth, it's not enough to read one or two books by respectable scholars.
You must read a lot of books, you must be critical of your sources, you
must constantly question everything because there are few absolutes. This
is why it takes a lot of time and experience to learn these sciences. There
are no "wiz kids" in history or theology.

Now, on to my recent flame. I regret that posting because it was too harshly
phrased and not very courteous. But I stand by the factual contents as such.

> You council that anyone who does not bow to the dictates of society
> is a fool worthy of chastisement.

NO! I DO NOT!

First, I did not say that we should bow to anything. On thy contrary, we
should try to educate everybody into a greater tolerance. But if you know
that there is a widespread prejudice against your group, and you openly
declare yourself to belong to that group, you *should be aware of* that
you are asking for trouble. Go out and make yourself a martyr if you want,
but don't whine about it, and don't act as if it came as a surprise to you.

Second there is a difference between witches and other minorities:

The bigotry and prejudice that prompts some people to persecute religious
or ethnic minorities usually has its roots in fear of a group of people
with different habits, different looks, different culture &c. It is mostly
a gut feeling that "they" are a threat to "us". This is then boosted by
the fellowship you can develop amongst your own group by uniting aginst
the others.

But most people don't even think of witches as a religious or ethnic minority.
Most people are not aware that there exists a group of people who call
themselves witches and that this means they practise a religion.

In our language, a witch is an evil creature out of the fairy tales. Together
with trolls, demons, vampires, werewolves and a whole bunch of other fantasy
creatures, they are the vehicles of evil in the old sagas. In history, witches
are women who were accused of being identical in behavior to the witches in
literature, i.e. satanists, i.e. consciously evil and hostile to people.

Imagine somebody living in a Jewish neighborhood, who wears a swastika and
claims to be a nazist. Guess what the Jews will do? And then the nazist
whines "But don't you know that there are *good* nazis, too?" This is virtually
the same thing as claiming to be a witch in our society. That witches are
evil is part of the *definition* in all western languages, as far as I know.
If you talk about "good" witches, people won't understand what you mean. You
might as well talk about good rapists, good nazis, good murderers or good
devils.

We may want to change this. We may want to change the definition of the word
"witch" in the common consciousness, But as it is today, we can hardly blame
those who react negatively against someone who claims to be a witch. They
are not necessarily bigots, they just happen to speal a language where "witch"
in a well-known word meaning "evil woman". It's not *their* obligation to
know that there is a small group of intellectuals somewhere who have re-defined
that word. It is up to us to tell them.

The problem of someone who does both harm and good is one that comes more 
often than any of us like.  I belong to a polling order which has (so far) 
admitted members only by unanimous consent (not counting abstentions).  As a 
result it is rather hard to get into and some people who (i think) deserve to 
have been made members, havn't, and others who many think are worthy don't get 
it for years because it takes that long to do the polling (well, maybe i 
exaggerate ( maybe i dont)).  Anyway the problem comes up, and so far the 
answer is 'no' both to those people  whos ill effects seem to balance thier 
good, and to those who personalities are such that the ordermembers don't want 
to deall with them, despite thier manifest service.  In a polling order, i 
think this is right.  Not nessesarily good, but right.  The members of a 
polling order need to maintain the standards of their order, and egregious 
obnoxious ness, immaturity, and laack of judgement are some of the things that 
are considered.  (actually i belong to more than one polling order and i'm 
mixing arguments i've heard about a number of people and no, i don't 
nessesarily mean you).

The crown, on the otherhand, is above such things.  The crown should be 
capable of recognising merit where it exists and ignoring irritating 
personality traits.  I had the privalage of witnessing a couple years ago the 
award of a qoc (queen's order on courtesy, eastern award of courtesy) and the 
words of the presentation boiled down to something like this: "we award this 
to (X) for haveing attained by his own efforts that level of courtesy which we 
expect as a matter of course from anybody else"  At the time i was shocked, 
but on reflection and discussion with others, concluded that in this case the 
award was appropriate and deserved.  

conclusion:  Good work deserves recognition, efforts at self-improvement 
should be recognised and encouraged.  We're a monarchy for a good reason.

From a strictly logical viewpoint, of course its a popularity

you should recieve an award, and will send in recommendations.  if
you aren't popular you will probably recieve less recommendations.

As to the question of recommending the person who both helps and

I am grateful for the reference to Snurlson's edda, I argue
(ingrate), however, that it is such legends that are the real
theology of a religion. Ceremonies may be missing, but no 
religion has ever come to life out of those learned tomes
standing unused on those musty library shelves. There were
many sacred stories in the Brother's Grimm.

The discipline problem mentioned reminds me a bit of Loki, the doer of
good and of evil. The technology to handle such cases is in the
PTS/SP section (potential trouble source/ suppressive person)
of The Volunteer Minister's Handbook by Hubbard. Until he straightens
up, perhaps he should wear the Fret as would a goodly thrall.
I also suggest hunting down those offended and finding out why.
Explain that good cause for unchivalrous conduct is no excuse.
Cite the book of John for that.

The discussion of religion belongs as much in the SCA context as
in any other discussion of religion. The SCA is a poor man's time machine.

Sorry for posting this to the rialto, but for some reason I can n ot seem
to reach you via mail.

1) I am just starting fighting, and therefore am also curious about
the popularity/ lack of same of thrusting tips.  Since I have yet to
develop a 'style', I'd like to know if thrusting and defense against
it are something to try to develop.

(As an aside, what do Eastrealmers think of the new face-thrusting rules
for Crown Tourney?)

2) At Lunacon, someone told me they use Porter yeast to make mead.
BTW, what is a good mead recipe?

3) Holdsworth's 'History of England' is a good volume of political/
cultural history on the period (but it has no descriptions of
dress if that is what your looking for).

And now, a question of my own.  How do you lay the padding inside a
helm.  I assume it must be done after welding, but is there a method
to it other than simply covering it with glue and shoving it in

I have to side with the crows on this one.  We are drifting off the Rialto and
out to sea, so I'll limit the verbiage as much as possible.

a)  The social sciences, like the natural sciences, contain good work and sloppy
work, and the people in the relevant fields generally know which is which.

b)  To the extent that this has been tested it has been repeatedly shown that
people do *not* understand the "basic concepts".

c)  It doesn't take less time to understand, when dealing with the humanistic
sciences.  It just takes less time to *think* you understand.  The understanding
of 1066-and-all-that that you can get in an hour is worth as much as the
understanding of quantum mechanics that you can get in a one-hour popular
science lecture given by Mr. Knowitall or some similar luminary.  It's just
harder to fool yourself when dealing with the natural sciences.

e)  Not having "right answers" and "complete information" is hardly the sole
curse of the humanities.  On the other hand, there are scads and scads of
*wrong* answers.  The study of the humanities is to a large extent devoted to
identifying old mistakes.  What makes sophomoric arguments sophomoric is that
they tend to use as givens arguments which were bandied and rejected years,
decades or centuries ago.

Certainly there are major differences between the natural sciences and the
humanities, but many of these stem from the fact that the natural sciences are,
intrinsically so much easier that it is much easier to detect BS in those fields
and much more difficult to pass such BS as legitimate currency.

	I would say that what you have here are two completely different
problems.  If they have done the work then they should be recommended
*completely and without consideration of their social shortcomings*!
If they have problems socially with the group then that should be delt
with outside of SCA channels, talking with them privately perhaps, unless
they are acting in an unchivalrous manner at events, in which case there
are methods formal and informal of letting them know that their actions
are inappropriate.

	Lets face it, for a lot of us SCA is a big family, and who amoung us
get along with *all* their relatives?  Just because someone does not 
conform to the social standards of the group is not a reason for the 
group to avoid them, but it is a reason for individuals to avoid them.
You say that this gentle has performed great service for the group, 
obviously *someone* works with them, so not all the group finds them
intolerable.  It is particularly regretable that they have scared off
newcomers to me, but all run that risk.  Everything else you list is a
personal matter between the person and other individuals.  The next to 
last item in particular is purely between that person and their spouse,
regardless of the truth or baseness of the tale, not something that the
Society has any concern with.

William!  Most of the time you contribute wondeful and important advice, but
this time I think you let your frustration with the situation get the better
of you.  Don't blame the victim--which is what it sounds like you're doing. 
All anyone has to do is substitute the word 'gay', '(your favorite
ethnicity)', or in this case '(your favorite religion)' to make it obvious
the ground you're standing on is very shakey indeed.  As far as pagans and
witches having trouble from Christian sects, I can believe it, since these same
intollerant groups are the cause of a lot of in-fighting among the ranks. 
However, from personal experience I don't have much use for certain pagan
sects either.  

(I come from Lousisana, and because of the high water table, the tombs are
situated above instead of underground in many areas.  Suffice to say, my
community is not pleased when certain groups think nothing of intruding on
Christian burial ground, holding rituals there-upon, and stealing bones from
tombs of people totally unrelated to them.)

In spite of this, I must continually remind myself not _all_ witches fit the
stereotypes fed to me.  The only way this came about was because witches who
were 'stupid' enough to publicly say "I'm a witch" instead of scampering
around in the dark unseen managed to open my mind to the fact _they_ were
people too.  I may never understand these people's outlook on life, but at
least I now have the simple human deciency not to make life hell for them
because they don't have my beliefs.

It's been suggested to me that this gives us a fallback position in case
"Principality of the Lakes" doesn't pass, since we could be the "Principality of

It does seem more likely to pass as it differs from the "Principality of the

    While this is not an appropriate topic for this newsgroup, I feel
compelled to respond to Don Levey's article.   Even so, I will try to
keep it short.

Don Levey:

    Science is not a "set of constraints artificially imposed on nature
by man".   Science is a series of common sense rules for figuring out complex
natural phenomina.  First you guess.   Then you perform experiments to
try to figure out if your guess is right or wrong.   Then you guess again.
This does not constrain the natural event in the least.

    The use of the word "artificial" is interesting.   What is a 'Set of
constraints "naturally" imposed on nature'?    Most of the words Don uses
are completely devoid of meaning in the context that he puts them.

    There are indeed "things" which cannot be explain by science.   Science
cannot tell what Julius Ceasar has for breakfast on his 17th birthday,
science cannot tell what happened before this universe existed, science
cannot proove one priests spiritual theory over anothers (unless experimental
data suddenly comes available -- such as a heavanly host appearing).

    Science limits itself to things which can be manifestly proven TRUE
or FALSE.   This limits it's scope, but also gives it tremendous power.
It turns out many things can be proven True or False, which once were
the province of chance (attended by much hope, prayer, and ritual).

    This worries some priests.   Once, people went to a Priest when they
were sick.   Now they go to a doctor.   The priest offered hope and prayer.
Now, the doctor can often offer a cure.   Some selfish priests hate the loss
of prestege.   They put their own pride before the health of their people,
and try to "disprove" science.  Usually, they only show their own ignorance.

    This is false.  Quantum Mechanics subsumed the General Theory of
Relativity (which subsumed the Special Theory of Relativity).   They
are not in any conflict with one another.

    Furthermore, even where there ARE paradoxes with hypothesis/theories,
this only shows that one or another theory is incorrect on some point.
It does not show that Science itself is incorrect.

Tempest in a teapot.  One thing that made me proud of Canada was a story
on page 14 of the newspaper I saw one day.  One fellow - who called himself
a witch - asked to have two days (May 1 and Nov. 1, as I recall) off for
religious reasons.  His boss said no, he appealed to the Workemn's
Compensation Board, and got the days off.  (He offered to work, say,
Thanksgiving, but was turned down.)

His victory was also on page 14 of the newspaper.  I.e. interesting, but
no big deal.  I felt oddly pleased by this.  (I'm only visiting Seattle;

Subject: Religions (something about a dead dog...?)

My lord William de Corbie (did I get that right?), I wish to respond to 
your comments. This posting has a couple of sections which may or may not
be related. Connect them at your peril, gentle readers :-).

Regarding science, I view it as a way that we humans see the world. We 
observe a phenomenon, and make up a rule to explain it. The rule proves
wrong, and we make up another one. In short, science is a set of constraints
artificially imposed upon nature by man. There are things which cannot be
explained by science, and things which are in direct conflict with it.
For fun, try reconciling the special theory of relativity with quantum
mechanics. It can't be done. They are both accepted as true, and yet they
are in direct conflict with each other on several points. I mention this
only because you mention that the existance of an authentic sect of Norse
religion is scientifically imposible. So is the random coalescance of
molecules to form life, which is why we have God anyway.

Personally, as a clergyperson myself (Cantor in a synogogue (Jewish)), I
have severe problems with ANY religion that claims divine origin and right,
to the exclusion of all others. Judaism does it, so does Christianity (please
forgive my lumping all sects into one category), and so do most other major
religions. From a sociological standpoint, that's how to run a religion.
If you claim that yours is the only "light and path," then people have more
of an incentive to follow you. I don't really care if you worship Ralph, the
sacred Head of Lettuce, but please don't tell me that what I do isn't 
religiously or scientifically correct. How much of religion can stand the
scrutiny of science anyway?

WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!
 ----- Remark possibly interpreted as extremely obnoxious to follow --------

I also submit that although people are people and always will be, attitudes,
society, all sorts of things ABOUT people change significantly over time.
One theory I have heard on the Fall of Rome was that there was stagnation.
The society decayed because there was little change, little innovation.
People were satisfied with the life of their parents, and did not grow.
I believe that a religion that has refused to keep pace with the people and
the time has stagnated, decayed, and is outmoded. The Catholic church has
recognised this, which is why they are constantly reviewing their beliefs
and rituals. I know for a fact that the Masses of the Catholic Churh in
America are not what they were 25 years ago, let alone 250. Judaism is
the same way. Most of Judaism is not the same religion it was many years
in the past (some might say it is now Christianity ;-)). Can a religion
remain the same for so long and not die? It occurs to me that this might
apply to the Church of 1290 and also to the "modern" Norse religion. If the
shoe fits, wear it, but try it on yourself.

In closing, please believe that I do not mean to offend, though I tend to

Nothing like asking the *hard* questions . . .

First thing is to encourage the person to really *work* on
the personality reform.  (Indeed, if the problem is as
severe as you say, a gentle shove in the direction of 
professional help might be in order--this sounds like a 
very insecure person.)  Remember that behavior is part of
the qualifications for Society awards--and this sounds like
a case that shows why.

The next thing that comes to mind, is a quiet talk with the
persons spouse--who is also--no doubt--aware of the the
problem and the dilemma resulting from it.  Here, too, is
a place to search for causes.

In general--before this person will have any luck in
changing the problem behavior, he is going to have to 
figure out *why* the behavior is so persistent, and then
attack at the root cause rather than just the symptoms.

In the mean time--you can send a recommendation for "long
term watch" for possible award, and note the prescence
of the problems you have noted here.  While activity on that
front is pending, you may be able to do something to publically
notice the labors while not encouraging the behavior problem.

(This is, more or less, in response to Enid's quirey of whether she should reco
mmend someone for an award.)
Greetings from branwen o y gelli-aur

I'm going to pretend that I have no idea whom you are speaking of...
Awards such as the Purple Fret (middle kingdom service award), as far as I am a
ware, are for service, and are not supposed to be a popularity test.
If a gentils behavior is such to warrent this award to be granted, then by all
means, it should be done.
I see the problem here as a conflict between his "good behavior"- service to th
e barony ... and his "bad behavior"- disservice to some of the gentils who live
 there, and elsewhere.
(this is a very hard topic for me to write about, and I hope you receive some r
eplies from gentils who don't know him)

The public outcry at his receiving this award would be substantial...

But, as you say, he does do quite a lot, and does deserve the award.  The quest
ion is; do we ignore his behavior and base the award on service, or do we ignor
e his service, and base the non receiving on his behavior?
(It's unfortunate that he has damaged his chances so severely)
... this award is for service ... ...
(The outcry would die down, it always does)

I can't make any decision on this, a couple of people I know have been hurt (no
t physically!) by his actions...  not to mention the countless number of
people who are offended by him.  I feel that my views are heavily biased, but I
 have tried to answer your quirey as objectively as I can.

If anybody else can reply...

Gules, an escarbuncle argent within a laurel wreath and in chief a
coronet Or.

UNofficially, the Principality will consist of the western parts of NY
and PA, and perhaps bits of WV.  In SCA terms, that's the Baronies of
Thescorre, Rhydderich Hael, Delftwood, and Debatable Lands, plus the
shires of Sterlynge Vayle, Stormsport, Coppertree, Nemoralis Noctua,
Cour D'Or, the Dominion of Myrkfaelinn, and perhaps one or two groups
which I have forgotten (sorry!).  Currently, the incipient
principality has tentatively scheduled its first coronet tourney for
some time in September.

The name "The Lakes" was chosen by poll (over the alternative
Aethelmarc).  It was originally proposed because most of the groups
involved are either around the Great Lakes or in the Finger Lakes
region of NY.  I overheard a snippet of conversation at Ice Dragon
between Lord Magnus and Mistress Arianna.  Lord Magnus, who is from
BMDL (Pittsburgh) said "Now that we're a Principality, you guys owe
us a lake!"  "Oh, I dunno, I think three rivers equals one lake."

I think you have heard a garbled reference to the first part of
Snorri Sturluson's Edda, and yes, it's available in English. But
first, a little background:

Iceland converted to Christianity in 1000 CE, by parliamentary decision
--a pretty unique conversion. People who wished to continue worshipping
the old gods in private could do so--Iceland was, and remains, a
tolerant society--but pagan practices like exposing unwanted babies and
eating horsemeat were banned. So there was a fairly graceful transition
from one faith to the other, and the myths and legends lingered on as
part of the general literary culture.

But by the mid-thirteenth century this old-faith literary background
was being forgotten. This worried Snorri Sturluson, who was a leading
political and literary figure (same thing in Iceland) of the time.
In an effort to preserve what he saw as Iceland's literary heritage,
Snorri wrote a book he called _Edda_--the title may or may not mean
"grandmother", and there's disagreement about what Snorri meant by it.
_Edda_ was divided into three parts: "The Deluding of Gylfi", which 
retells many of the old myths (Gylfi is a king, not a saint); "Poetic
Diction", which gives the necessary background to understand various
literary allusions, telling a fair number of stories in the process;
and "The Enumeration of Meters", which is a poem of 102 stanzas, each
stanza in a different skaldic meter. What is *not* recorded anywhere
in the Edda is *anything* of the theology, doctrine, or religious
practices of the pagan Norse--these were long lost (or thoroughly
secret, if you insist), and Snorri was a good Christian for his time.
Snorri's book, called variously the Prose Edda, the Younger Edda, or
(logically) Snorri's Edda, is available in many English translations;
any good academic library should have a couple (prefer the most
recent if you have a choice). Other works by Snorri include the Heims-
kringla--tales of the Norwegian kings (see the story of Haakon the
Good for a wonderful attempt at compromise between the Christian king
Haakon and the pagan Norwegians)--and (almost certainly) Egil's Saga.

The reason I give so much background (besides my natural inclination)
is because all this touches on two other things I want to bring up:

1) In all the discussion I have been reading here about revived and/or
preserved Norse paganism, no one seems to have mentioned that Asatro,
the worship of the AEsir, is a state religion in modern Iceland along
with Lutheranism. They are a minority religion, true, but they are
certainly not persecuted (neither do they go about baiting Christians).
They are not skinheads or neo-Nazis but rather, by and large, they seem
pretty funky. In all the interviews with their clergy that I have read
(like two, I think, so I could be wrong on this), they make no claim
to a continuous, unbroken, underground tradition surviving intact since
1000; instead they claim to be a reconstructed, revived religion. I'm
not even going to *begin* to judge how scholarly or accurate they may
be in this, but there you are: a state-sanctioned Western European
revived pagan church.

2) (for my own research) There are plenty of stories of individual
Christians in Iceland before the year 1000; but can someone
out there direct me to *any* figure in the saga literature who stayed
pagan after the conversion?

If you've read all the way this far, I recommend to you Chapter 103
of Njals Saga for a *controlled* experiment to test the relative worth
of Christianity and paganism, I apologize for taking up your time, and
I thank you.

Subject: A Response to M'lord de Corbie
Message-Id: <7616@pucc.Princeton.EDU>

M'lord de Corbie recently posted two articles which I felt
were worth responding to.  In the first, he maintains that there
are 2 branches of science--natural and humanistic.  To speak
with authority in either requires many years of training. Yet, for
some reason, people who would never dream of expressing and opinion
about something in the natural sciences feel free to do so in
the humanistic sciences. (See Plato's dialogue "Protagoras")

The second article was a flame, in which he remarked that any woman
who, knowing that society at large will hassle a witch, and
persists in openly identifying herself as same, deserves to get her
butt kicked. (what about male witches?)

I trust I have stated the matters fairly m'lord?

As to the first, as you yourself pointed out, knowledge in these fields
is much more elastic.  Second, scince the basic tenets of these
humanist sciences concern all people, and we are familiar with the
basic concepts involved it takes far less time to appreciate
humanist science occurances than it does to understand the natural
science.  Example: I can get an a basic understanding of 1066 in
an hour, whereas it will take me weeks to understand Orgo.

Second, unlike in the natural sciences, there is no one right
answer.  Nor is it always possible to have complete information.
Therefore, people feel far more justified speculating in the humanist
sciences.

Now,as to you flame.  My lord, I am shocked!  You council that anyone
who does not bow to the dictates of society is a fool worthy of
chastisement.  But, how will society ever learn if those who know better
cater to its ignorance and refuse to challenge the stereotypes?  By
your argument, since black in the sixties 'knew' they would not be served
in certain restauraunts, they were fools to sit in and deserved to
be beaten for it.  After all, they KNEW this would happen.  Every
time a witch publicly identifies him/herself as such, and behaves
in a civilized manner, he/she has done a remarakable service to society
by educating people.  I know from experience.  I am an Orthodox Jew.
I wear a yarmalka in public.  This has resulted in several snide
comments and occasional violence.  And yet, I also have the pleasure
of people telling me that I was the first Orthodox Jew they'd met, and
they were so suprised to see we weren't all close minded folk who
deny the real world and believe in the literal word of thebible, arrogantly
brooking no counter opinion.  (I also proove we have no horns:)
My actions, though to you it may seem I deliberately invite attack, make
the world safer for me and mine in the future.

Subject: Ice Dragon Anecdotes

Ice Dragon is a Rhydderich Hael (Buffalo) baronial event that got out of hand.
This year it was limited to 600 people -- 320 onboard and 280 offboard.  There's
a fencing tourney, but its main features are its rattan tourney and its arts and
science competition -- each with over a hundred entries.  So much for background.

1.  Most of the peformance entries in the A&S competition came from the BMDL
(Barony Marche of the Debatable Lands/Pittsburgh).  This was apparently
perceived as being due in large part to the encouragement of Remus Fletcher, so
he was drafted as one of the judges.  Unfortunately (from the A&S standpoint)
Remus is a good fighter, and they were worried that he wouldn't be eliminated
from the tourney in time for the judging.  So the A&S office put a price on his
head:  One pound of Hershey's kisses, payable to the fighter who eliminated
Remus Fletcher before 1:30 PM.  (Duke Visivald collected.)

2.  Partway through the evening an extremely irate autocrat announced that there
was a crying child who had been left in the children's room *unattended*.  Five
people got up and left the feast hall.

3.  One of the performance entries (instrumental, solo) was a very poorly
documented piece of Viking music, entered by the first person ever to submit
entries in all twelve major categories of the Arts Pentathlon.  I was later
told, by someone who recognized the music, that the reason it was so poorly
documented was that it was, in reality, the music for "Bend Over Greek Sailor".
(A rowing song, of course.)

4.  It was announced at the Court that the western part of the East Kingdom had
voted to become a principality.  The poll also resulted in opting for the name
"Principality of the Lakes" (I'll skip the editorial comments) and a device
(someone want to put it in heraldese?) that looks more or less like a white
snowflake on a red background.  We were *not* *officially* told what the
principality would contain.

I was wrong... After speaking to an ex-Star Signet (Kingdom
deputy Herald in charge of scrolls and official documents) I 
have a little better info. Basically you are entitled to a 
free scroll every time your heraldic achievment advances.
Unfortunately I have two different descriptions of what
exactly *that* means. The ex-Star Signet (who I am more likely
to believe ) says that almost every award makes one elgible for
a new scroll with the ones that *don't* change your heraldic
achievment being fairly rare. The other opinion was that you get
a scroll when you get your first award at the levels of award of
arms, grant of arms, and peerage. This doesn't make sense with 
what I've seen where every award is accompanied by a scroll. The
point I'm trying to make now is that if you want a different
scroll besides the one you were presented with (for whatever reason)
then that is your responsibility.

An interesting sidelight is that of the forty to fifty kingdom-level
scrolls this gentleman has done, he hasn't charged for one. I believe
he even does scrolls by request without charging for them (as opposed
to making an award scroll at the request of the crown or in
the service of the college of scribes.) He only charges for exotic
materials (such as gold-leaf) and then only if he doesn't have any 
on hand.  His reasoning is that every award scroll is in service to
the kingdom and shouldn't be charged for. I think scroll-making in
this context is fundamentally different than say armor-making and
even fundamentally different than making scrolls on commision which
I fully support. But I still can't help admiring this person for what
seems incredible unselfishness.

Subject:  Re: pagan persecutions

Greetings!

With respect to Awilda Halfdane's posting about pagan persecution:  I would
like to note for those on the Rialto outside the USA (especially Europe) that
the largely Protestant Puritan history of the US has colored popular
perceptions about pagans and paganism in a highly negative manner.  Most
Americans are going to know little beyond the old image of the infamous
"Salem Witch Trials" in the 17th/18th centuries, in Salem, Massachusetts.  To
this day, the thought of "witches" sparks an almost panicky reaction in most.
And quite frankly, the traditions behind the American celebration of
Hallowe'en don't help; nor do the depictions of witches in such tales as those
by the Bros. Grimm (e.g., "Hansel & Gretel").

It's unfortunate, but it's true.

	I believe it -- that sort of silliness/sadism is all too common in
this country -- and you needn't be pagan to suffer from it.  A generation
or more ago, you could be Jewish, Catholic, Buddhist, or just not Baptist
and get much the same sort of treatment at the hands of rednecks.
	There is _some_ danger of that sort of thing becoming more widespread
in the general U.S. culture -- but there always has been.  In general, it
is uncommon, though.  It is a specific example of the general hominid
tendency to pick on the "strange" -- the "pink monkey syndrome".
	If you catch a monkey and paint him pink, the other members of his
troupe will cast him out until after the paint wears off -- hominids hate
strangeness.  I don't approve of this, I just comment . . .

Subject: Paganism & religion in Sweden

Just to explain how really different the US and Sweden may be, (to both swedes
and americans), I'd like to post a few observations on paganism and religion
in Sweden. First of all, I should probably state Im an agnostic myself 
(mundanely), of the rather sceptic, non-believing kind. For all Ive read
it seems that noone of this (non)conviction has put forward any comments.

The most important fact of religion in Sweden is the existence of a State 
church. This church has been Lutheran since the reformation enforced
by king Gustav Vasa in 16th century. The majority  of the swedish people are
still members of this church, altough many of them for reasons of tradition
or disinterest only. (Your made a member when born and have to actively leave
the organisation not to be). In my very nonreligious family my parents
used go to church a couple of times around christmas, more to achieve
"christmas mood" than for religious needs, I think.

Other churches include those of various immigrant communities (including
mainstream catholics) and the kind churches known in Sweden as "free churches",
ie Baptists, Methodists, Salvation Army and so forth. There are also rather
active communties of mormons and witnesses. Mosaic congregations  have
existed for at least a couple of hundred years.

Pagans in Sweden come in two varieties: Nordic and others. While the "Others" 
resemble the descriptions of US pagans given by various posters, the "nordic"
belivers have a large percentage right-wing, skinhead, anti-immigrant and even
anti-american type of people that make them very hard to take seriously as a 
religious group.

Message-Id: <89Mar20.182229est.5229@gpu.utcs.toronto.edu>

I have a question for the folk of the Rialto.
 
If someone in your group has performed a LOT of service-
teaching, autocratting, open houses, hospitality, demos,
donation of labour on artifacts for use of your local group
and of a larger group-you would probably think this person
more than worthy of a mid-level service award (ie.the Purple
Fret, since this is the Middle Kingdom.  The Fret is not
a polling order, it is by recommendation to the Crown.)
 
What do you do when this person has, over the past years,
aroused so much hostility in the group that there are people
who refuse to be in the same room with that person, let
alone work with them?  When the person up for consideration
has received repeated warnings, one of them public, that
their public "morality" is not acceptable.
 
This is someone who
doesn't conform to the conservative behaviour of the group-
a sometime grabber, who stands too close, who gives the
impression sometimes of being unfaithful to their spouse, who
has scared off newcomers a couple of times.  You know that
the person has this personality problem, that they've
tried to work on it, and in fact are much better than they
used to be-but the basic style is touchy-grabby and its not
likely to change.   You personally have never had trouble
with the person, and have never witnessed any outrageous
behaviour.
 
This person's service has been real and valuable.  I would
say they have definitely done more good than harm, even if
in a less tolerant group (or if the person were single) they
would probably be out on their ear by now.  This person is
fully aware why they don't have a Fret to date.
 
The Fret is in the gift of the Crown, of course, yet I realize
my recommendation would carry some weight.  I would far rather
reward service than punish bad behaviour.  I keep waiting for
a stretch of say, a year, where I hear no report of bad behaviour.
It hasn't happenned.
 
What do I do?

Subject: Religion

I recall that at the christianising of the Norse, there had been a book
published relating the theology being extinguished, The deception of 
Saint something-or-other. Does anyone know if this is available in 
modern english?

The real evidence that the norse religion has bowed to christianity
is given by Wm. deCorb: Look, where's the Odin Mut?
I think that lady with the iron bar sounded pretty authentic.

"Thor, will you destroy that castle", "Odin, I've just got to borrow
Jalangir" or "Frigga! Why couldn't you have fixed me up????"
I suspect that they were pretty glad of the opportunity to dump
the load on the Vedic god these christians are worshipping. He's got
the admin for it anyway.

As to the original question, of religious goings on at events, it's
quite easy not to insult good people and that's all we really seem
to be asking. Of course, a christian regard for the feelings of a
retired pantheon may not be period for a christian personna, we'll
make allowances.

I'd like to wish one and all a happy celebration of the reserection
of Easter, the fertility goddess.

Does anyone know about that book?

I just read your note, here on alt.sca, about the olde prayer you have and, if
it is AT ALL possible, could I have a copy of't?  I'm a member of a Fantasy
group, with about half of us being Pagan and half being Christian, and we will
be celebrating a hand-fasting this midsummer.  The to-be-bonded couple are
Catholic, and so wish a ceremony that reflects their beliefs, but also desire to
include the non-Christian members of our group in the ceremonial happenings.
Your prayer sounds as if't could be a way to help this happen.

Subject: science
Message-ID: <890321020918.15.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

Sam'l Basset is right that "science" means a different thing in Europe than
it does in the USA. Here in Europe, it means any kind of knowledge which
has been proved with rationally acceptable methods. We make a difference
between "natural sciences" which are math, physics, chemistry &c, and 
"humanist sciences" which are history, religion, literature &c.

The humanist sciences are less absolute than the natural ones. For instance,
we cannot know for certain that Julius Caesar has existed, since he is not
available for examination. Almost all humanistic knowledge is non-provable
in the natural-science-sense of the word. Further, humanist knowledge 
touches directly on the opinions and thoughts of the people involved. It is
difficult to be objective even if you desire objectivity, which not all
"scientists" do. Many historians set out with the avowed purpose of proving
a point, e.g. marxist historians whi are out to reveal the class struggle
in everything they see.

The subjects which "humanist sciences" research are often terribly compli-
cated, and there is usually a wide choice of different ways to approach them.
All too often, we choose our method not according to what we want to really 
want to know, but according to which tools that are available, or (worse)
according to what suits our personal opinions and biases.

When you read a book on history, religion or any other "humanist science",
it takes *a lot* of knowledge on your part, for you to be able to detect
such errors. I'm not saying that true knowledge is impossible here. We may
not always be able to present "hard fact" types of data of the sort which
is usually available in the natural sciences. But there is still a vast
difference between scientifically established facts on the one hand, and
subjective opinions/wishful thinking/conjecture on the other, in humanistic
sciences.

I would like to administer an admonition to all who take part in the discus-
sion on religion. Call me a "wise guy" or a "know-it-all" if that makes you
happier. I know this sounds really stuffy and up-tight, especially with my
less-than-perfect command of English style of language. But here it is.

You can't just read a couple of books and then throw yourself into a debate
thinking that you *know* what you are talking about. I have seen postings
on religion here which indicate a fundamental ignorance combined with an
absolute conviction on the part of the poster that he/she is well-informed.

Science is like a mountain. To get to the top, you must climb from the bottom.
If you take a shortcut (a helicopter that puts you on the top), you will see
the top but you won't know what's under you. You will make gross mistakes.
And up there, it's very difficult for those who *really* know these things
to explain them to you - because you lack the basics. GO TO "START" WITHOUT
COLLECTING THE NOBEL PRIZE.

Consider the natural sciences: an intelligent but uneducated person cannot
immediately understand a doctor's thesis in molecular physics. Perhaps a
good teacher can explain what it's about. But to truly understand such a
thing, you need 20 years of education and practise. You must know mathematics.
You must be familiar with scientific procedures, laboratory methods, logics,
philosophy, and the current state of research. Without these, you will not
be able to understand how all these things lead up to a certain piece of
truth.

In natural sciences, people tend to accept "scientific" facts which they
lack the education to truly understand. We believe what the scientists tell
us about physics, math, chemistry. But in humanist sciences, everybody is
suddenly an expert, and the words of a scientist who has worked with these
things for 20 years and *knows* are questioned by many people who have
only read an article in Reader's Digest. 

My admonition is: don't make cocksure statements if you haven't climbed the
mountain. Don't trust the helicopters (popular books and articles). Be
careful lest you spread untruth. One example is the discussion about wether
the Church cared what the peasants believed in. The answer, irritatingly, is
both yes and no.

FLAME ON!

Common sense dictates that - no matter what you believe in - you must pay
regard to the obvious, common opinions and ideas which exist in the world
around you. If you are stupid enough to openly call yourself a witch, when
you *know* that most people are absolutely convinced that witches are *evil*
women who dabble in sorcery and satanism, you deserve to get your butt kicked.

I'm not saying that those who persecute "witches" are doing the right thing,
but I'm saying that their behavior is exactly what you should expect. 

FLAME OFF!

Addendum: Is this really the right forum for a discussion about religion
(per se)? Shouldn't we be talking about SCA-related stuff? Wether or not
christians persecute pagans or if pagans eat children or if Lutherans 
caused the inquisition, are questions which may be interesting but have
very little bearing on current SCA business.

To all good gentles,

I find myself in great need of information and would ask aid of any who could
could help.

My lady and I plan to marry at Pennsic in two or three years.  Because of the
time required to prepare--the making of wedding garb, in particular--we would
like to start planning now.

The problem is this: we are short on ideas of how to proceed.

Information of any sort would be appreciated, information and sources about
genuine medieval weddings as well as information on what has been done in the
SCA.  Any SCA wedding stories are very welcome; the more detailed, the better!

Specifically, we need to know what forms the ceremony could take and what sort
of garb would be appropriate.

We would also like to have a feast following, with music and dancing.  How has
this been handled?  Are there any foods or music traditional to a wedding
celebration?

Please send any information--anything at all--either directly to me or to this
forum.

                   In service to the Dream,

In the debate about whether an authentic tradition of Norse paganim survives
from medeival times, someone asked the question, if such people exist, why
don't they come forward?  The answer is twofold: 1) A tradition of secrecy,
2)Fear of persecution. I do not belong to a secret tradition (only an obscure
one), so I will leave the discussion of traditional secrecy to someone else.  I
will merely note that many traditions feel secrecy is a powerful reinforcement
for their teachings.  

Many people think that in the United States, a land famous for its freedoms
that a religious minority has nothing to fear.  This is not true.  This is
country dominated by a Christian majority who are willing and able to impose
their will on other people.  I will provide a short list of true and easily
verifiable examples.

1) Christian "right-to-lifers" succeeded in denying welfare moneys for abortion
for poor women. their argument is "We shouldn't have to pay taxes to support
something we don't believe in."

2)Jesse Helms introduced a bill (Amendment 401)  into the Congress of the 
United States denying tax-exempt status to pagan, Satanic,a nd sorcerous
 churches.  The pagans cried out, but few people beyond the American Civil
 Liberites Union paid any attention until it was pointed out  to them that
 the defintion of "sorcery" was sufficiently broad to include any church 
that was not a mainstream church.  It was defeated.  Helms and his cronies
 continue introducing similar bills.

3)Two pagans known to me were set upon by members of a Bible study group,
beaten to the ground, and slashed with razors blades. One required over a
hundred stitches in his face.

4)A friend of mine lives in a small apartment building. She is a a pacifist and
a vegetarian who who couldn't hurt a thing.  When her neighbor across the hall
found out she was a witch, the neighbor put an iron bar over her door and
forbid her children to play with my friend's children.  Whenever they meet in
the hall she makes the sign agaisnt the evil eye at her.

5)While I walked down the street in my neighborhood a group of children started
chorusing "Witch! Witch! Witch!" I stopped to talk to them.  They told me that
a witch was a bad woman who wears black and rides a broomstick. I tried to
explain to them that there were good witches too.  They wanted to see me ride
my broomstick.  The oldest of these kids was about four.

6)A pagan is falsely imprisoned on child pornography charges because he refuses
to recant his religion and go back to his very wealthy, politically important
family.

7)Prisoners in American prisons are allowed the services of a minister of their
faith, plus are allowed to conduct religious activities.  The prison provides
the materials and space necessary for the religious activities.  This is denied
to pagan prisoners.

Pagan religious sites are frequently vandalized, pagan organizations are challenged
in court (but more often the local authority decides to reinterpret the laws
under which the pagans were operating in order forbid them from doing what they
do), pagans are harassed and assaulted.  Many are afraid of losing their jobs,
their kids, their friends.  (Accusation of witchcraft is generally sufficient
to decide custody in divorce cases.)

  It is because of the hostility of the
mundane world that SCA is so attractive to pagans.  It is one of the few places
where they are tolerated.  Even so, while pagans may admit to being pagan in
the context of the SCA, most are careful to preserve a buffer of ignorance
between themselves and others so that should somebody decide to get nasty, it
will be hard for them to get at the pagan.  I know this statement has aroused
some people's curiosity, but I am not going to enlighten you.  Suffice it to
say, even soembody as verbose and public on the subject as I am is paranoid and
I'm not going to tell you about my boltholes.

Subject: religion for peasants/witchcraft

Greetings gentles from Juliana of Felding, Carolingia, East

As I am currently taking a history class on religion and witchcraft in the 
Middle Ages and Renaissance, I feel that I must address some of the points on
peasants, heresy, religion, and witchcraft in our time period.  Unfortunately, 
much of the scholarship until recently had heavy biases.  A good example of 
this phenomenon is Steven Ozment who was a Lutheran minister before teaching 
religious history at Harvard.  Thus, one must take the scholarship, especially 
that of 20+ years ago with a very large grain of salt.

To a very large extent peasants in the Middle Ages were allowed to believe 
what they wanted as long as they paid their tithes, went to confession and 
received communion once a year.  Often the village priest was not much more 
educated than the rest of the populus with the exception of knowing enough 
Latin to be able to say the mass (which often he did not completely understand).
Keith Thomas in his _Religion and the Decline of Magic_ cites many examples of 
practices that the Church put up with that definitely had pagan overtones.  
Ecclesiastical debates centered around universities and papers written in Latin,
therefore only a small segment of the population truly understood Catholic 
doctrine in all its complexity.  In fact, many of Luther's concerns had been 
discussed for years in the universities, with little repercussions on the 
author or the populus, witness John Wyclif in England.  Reformers such as 
Wyclif, Erasmus, and Thomas More challenged the excesses of the Church, in 
relation to mispent money and clerical abuses, such that many comtemporary 
scholars believe that the Church in the late 15th century was "more pure" than 
in the past.  Thus, Luther's popularity was intricately tied to the phenomenon 
of the printing press which allowed his translated message to be seen and 
understood by the merchant and artisan classes.  Heretical movements 
before 1520 were often allowed to exist for a while before the church did 
anything because they often died out on their own.  Often, secular authorities 
felt more threatened by the movements because economic concerns were often on 
the heretics agenda.  For example, Jan Hus of Bohemia was burned by Emperor
Sigismund in the 14th cent., not by the Church.  The Church only became severly 
repressive after the advent of Luther because of the can of worms (versus the 
diet of worms) that was opened as people began to read the vernacular Bible 
and come up with their own ideas, in conflict with Catholic doctrine.  

Now, as to witchcraft, that was a phenomenon strongly attached to the 
Reformation, Counter-Reformation, and misogynist attitudes of the 16th and 17th 
centuries.  In the Middle Ages, convents flourished as a place for women who 
"didn't fit" to go.  Admittedly, they was predominantly for upper-class women, 
but they also provided charity for widows and unmarried young women of lower 
classes.
With Luther's emphasis on salvation "by faith alone" and religious experience in
marriage, good works like charity declined as well as convent populations. In 
England many convents were closed due to smaller populations and for increased 
revenue for the monarchy.  To be fair to Luther, he stated that while man could 
be saved only through faith, good works would follow since he would be a "good 
man" and do them naturally.  Therefore, there were fewer acceptable places for 
women to go who "didn't fit" and charity for widows and unmarried women fell 
off dramatically.  Scapegoatism ensued because women became more of a "burden 
to society".  Witchcraft trials often started with widows being the first 
accused.  Inquisitors often employed torture to "discover" who else in the 
village associated with the "witch", leading to false accusations.  Often the 
trial stopped in an area when wives of top officials were implicated, leading 
to questions of veracity of the trial.

I will be able to offer more on the question of witchcraft as my class 
continues this semester.  In the hopes of adding accurate historical evidence 
to the debate on religious issues, I am

A word of caution about boffer matches.  At the Lakewood Renfaire,
I climbed into the abandoned feceing list to practice engage in a boffer
match with a housemate.  This drew lots of attention, and in no time at

Subject:  Children

Greetings!

I have just finished reading Mistress Siobhan's recent postings on the subject
of children.  I heartily support everything she says.  I should now like to
address the problem of dealing with the parents of children who mis-behave,
and would like it noted that I literally grew up behind a lunch counter on
Long Island (my parents owned a luncheonette in Great Neck for more than 20
years...).  So, I've dealt with these problems in a mundane capacity as well
as in a Society capacity.

*The* big problem with dealing with this sort of parent is their tendency to
refuse to believe that *their* child is a problem.  I've always found that
parents of erring children, when spoken to, react in one of two ways:  either
they grab their kids by the ear and haul them off to be reprimanded; or they
take *great* umbrage and cause a huge scene, or ignore the situation
completely!

Either of these latter scenaria are difficult to deal with.  I can't say I
honestly blame seneschals (etc.) from not wishing to deal with such
situations.  People will accept reprimands about their own behavior
gracefully, yet perceive complaints about their childrens' behavior (however
well justified) as a personal attack.

Let me relate an anecdote from my days as a child short-order cook:  our
luncheonette was located but a mile from the police station.  When my parents
would catch a child shoplifting, they took the kid to the back of the store
where the 'phones were.  My father would then hand the kid a dime and say,
"You have a choice:  either *you* call your parents and tell them what you
did, and tell them to come get you; or *I* call the cops, the cops take you to
the police station, and *they* call your parents and tell them what you've
done."  The kids *invariably* called their parents.

Well, one evening my mother caught a young boy stealing candy.  The familiar
ritual was performed, ending with the boy calling his parents.  The boy's
father soon appeared.  He grabbed the boy by the collar and said, "Get on your
bike, get your ass home, and you *will* be in your room when I get there!"
The father then thanked my parents, saying that there had been problems with
the boy, and left.

BUT:  the next day, the boy's mother came in.  A monumental scene between this
woman and my mother ensued, which consisted mainly of this woman following my
mother around screaming that *her* son would *never* do such a thing; how
*dare* my parents make these accusations!  The woman only left when my mother
picked up the 'phone to report her for trespassing!

The memory of this incident has always remained vivid, and has always summed
up for me the negative side of the very issue we're discussing.  The only ways
I've ever known to deal with parents who refuse to accept responsibility for
their kids' behavior are as follows (and are partially dependent on the age of
the child(ren) involved):  if you are the autocrat, or whatever, put your foot
down firmly but politely and *don't* budge it; or, put first the child and
then the parents in a position where they *must* acknowledge the problem.
This goes whether you wish merely to talk to the parents, or to eject the
family from the site (the possibility of which must be accepted and faced up
to).  In effect, this is the approach my parents always used so well, and I
admit it.

And, it *does* work in a Society context.  When once I caught some kids *way*
out of line, I spoke to them severely (they all knew me, and I them), then
sent them to their parents with instructions to tell their parents what they
had done.  I made it clear that I'd be checking up on things.  Lo and behold,
they all did as they were told!  The lot of them later appeared on my doorstep
(tentstep?), led by one of the mothers, and apologized!

I realize that some of what I've written may seem harsh.  But I agree with
Mistrss Siobhan:  it is unfair for the group at large to be expected to put up
with such disruptions, and by so few.  That the SCA is a family group does
*not* excuse parents from their responsibilities!

Thank you for reading this.

A few words about whether the Church 'cared' about the spirituality
of the peasants.
Such questions are real sticky, and almost impossible to prove.
Of course, the Archbishop of Canterbary (sp?) is going to spend
a lot of time with the King of England, both from a church poltical
point of view and because the Archbishop is The King's personal
confessor, and needs to minister to his personal spiritual needs.
History (and historians) tend to focus on the 'big guns' like
kings, bishops and nobles, while leaving the 'small fry' parish
priests and peasants out of the limelight.  But the Catholic (meaning
all encompasing) church did not forget the either the town man-in-the
street or the serf-in-the-manure.  Criticism of the Church came latter
in the period, and led to the formation within the Church of movements
to 'reach out to the common people'. This was the original purpose behind
the Fransicans and Dominicans.  Always, however, the temptation lay for
the Church heirarchy to concern itself with politics, wealth, and the local
big-guns.  In short- statements such as the church did (not) care at all
about the peasants are subjective and are not constant through history.

Unto the Fisherfolk does Nicolette Bonhomme send greetings

     In an effort to save bleary eyes, this letter concerns only 'New
and Different,' to quote our senechal.

     Chivalry:  If it were possible to catalog the set of behaviours
which constitute chivalry, everyone in the society would be able to be
flawlessly chivalrous.  However, chivalry is highly SITUATIONAL as well
as personal.  At each event in a person's life requiring a judgement
call, it can be difficult to stop, consider, and THEN act.  To consider,
and then choose the chivalrous course, is that much harder, as it is rarely
the same choice as a gut reaction.  I consider it a challenge to which
I am always attempting to rise.  A society-specific case: being the voice
of reason and being willing to believe the best of others.  Heaven knows
most of us have a 'gossip-tooth' like a candy-lover has a 'sweet-tooth.'

     The Dream: Here is my version of the Dream, which I rarely see
mentioned.  To quote an article from the Known World Handbook, the great
joy of the society, to me, is being 'a Creator, not a Consumer.'  The mundane
world we live in is extremely consumer-oriented.  I am often left to wonder
where is the personal satisfaction in the lives of my mundane co-workers
who are either shopping or watching television.  Ouch!  I have dabbled
happily in inkle-weaving, wool- and flax-spinning, mead and applejack
brewing, cooking, garb-making, armor-making, and very soon heavy list.
I never go anywhere without a drop spindle, nor would many women before
(approx.) 1300.  The point is not the yarn I spin, but the sheer joy of
watching the spindle go 'round.  The satisfaction comes in the DOING, not
the HAVING, n'est-ce pas?

     I would love to hear about which period activities give people
the most satisfaction and why.

What a dilemma! Good question, milady!
 
I once had a very heated argument about this very topic with the
seneschal of a nearby group. It seems that they had, at the time,
only one couple with children, and those children were (and still
are, some 5 years later, sigh) very un-managed and disruptive. At
the time, this group had a habit of meeting at people's houses over
the summer, when the college was closed, and they had some people
who did not want to allow children in their houses at all, much less
these 3 disruptive brats. So they made a ruling that if the "host"
(and i use the word loosely) wished, people with children could be
banned from the public meeting for that particular meeting, or made
to stay outdoors while the rest of the business meeting went on
inside. They posted their monthly schedule in advance of the
meeting, and some of those meetings were labelled "no children".
 
Now, as a parent who sometimes visited this group, with my child, I
was very annoyed about this, especially when the seneschal admitted
to me that the real problem wasn't children in general, but these
particular children. I don't understand (and probably never will)
why people don't face up to problems and deal with them on a
personal level rather than making them bigger by dealing with them
bureaucratically. I urged the seneschal to talk to these parents,
let them know that their children were being pests, and ask them to
please take them in hand. Such behavior would not be tolerated in
adults -- in our local group we have had adults who were disruptive
and obnoxious, and no one waited around to tell these folks that
their behavior needed to be modified. But this seneschal felt that
he had no right to ask these parents to control their kids. [Anyone
have any hints about that? Are we as parents so grumpy over the
subject of our kids that no one wants to approach us about their
behavior?]
 
[As a side-side note, our local barony has a policy that a meeting
cannot be held in any location which is not open to all members of
the group. Therefore, we can't schedule meetings in a University
room which isn't open to, say, men, or other such restrictions. It's
also true that we've used this to squelch factionalism -- when we
had a nasty schism, once, we had people who wouldn't let other
people on their property. No meetings could be held at that house
while that policy was in effect. It's been good for us.]
 
As an autocrat or other officer at an event, I've never hesitated to
let a parent know when his or her kid was doing something stupid,
disruptive, or dangerous. When I caught a group of kids "skiing"
down a stack of tables in the back of our feast hall when the hall
was closed (the kids were about 8) I collared the rascals and
marched them back out to general area, and didn't release them to
their parents until I let the parents know what was going on. I also
told the parents as kindly and firmly as I could that I was busy
cooking, and that we did not have daycare at this event, and that
the responsibility of looking after their children belonged to them.
 
I may be more aggressive about this because I am a mother, and I
know that if my kid was doing something disruptive I would want to
know about it!
 
I think (take a deep breath and be brave here) that if a child
continually disrupts an event, or is crying in court perpetually, or
is repeatedly and generally obnoxious, then the seneschal of the
group has every right to ask the parent to remove the child. It
doesn't have to be a public banning -- but a quiet word, and an
offer to help with the parent's stuff, is probably appropriate.
We've removed adults for drunkenness -- quietly, with a knight
escorting a rowdy gentle out and helping them find someone to drive
them home -- and other obnoxious behavior. Why can't we do the same
for children?
 
Thank you for your patience with my ramblings.

that for a pagan to be a "sham" protestant (for instance), and not an out-of-
the-closet pagan, they must be insincere.

I am a Unitarian Universalist and Jewish by upbringing, a pagan by practice. 
I am on the national committee in the Unitarian Universalist Assn for pagan 
stuff (CUUPS), and a fairly well out of the closet pagan.  However, I attend
church in the UU community here, and see no contradiction between being an
active pagan and an active UU--nor with being an active buddhist or an active
creation-spirituality-catholic or a number of other things.

BUT, when I was living in a pagan (and mostly SCA) household a few years back,
when Ari and Nicholai (for those of you in carolingia) were getting married,
we decided to have a pre-wedding feast/picnic.  For purposes of this, I 
secured a kid (i.e. young goat) to roast with apples and onions and eggs for
the feast.  Since I went to visit friends on a farm several hours away to
procure this, I didn't get home until midnight.

I had the kid, field-dressed, in a black garbage bag.  I very quietly (since
I wanted it to be a surprise) took it into the kitchen to skin and finish
cleaning it.  When I started to skin it, it occurred to me that tanning a
kidskin would be a very sentimental gift for Ari & Nicholai.  Since I learned
how to tan hides growing up in Vermont, I decided to do this.  

I did a skinning job a taxidermist would have been proud of. (apologies to 
the vegetarian or squeamish gentles out there).  It took me a few hours.  To
keep myself awake (I'd just driven three hours by myself after a full day
in the country...) I sang to myself, moved briskly when I wasn't hunkered
down, and did the usual silly stuff you do when you're dead tired and trying
to keep yourself amused.

Now, we lived in a fairly homogenous Italian Catholic lower middle class 
neighborhood in a not-quite-suburb of Boston.  And it happened that our 
neighbor's kitchen window looked into ours.  And it happened that I was 
protecting my clothing from the mess of the carcass and the tanning bath
by not wearing it.  

The next thing we knew the neighborhood was abuzz that we were: satanists;
sacrificing animals in the house; holding strange rituals and sabbats (after
all they could hear odd music at strange hours...Moussorgsky, probably...:-);
and the board of health came in to shut down the house and evict us.  The
board of health, by the way, can ALWAYS find a reason to shut down a resi-
dency if they think they have enough reason.  Their reasons for us included
that we were breeding animals in the house (we had a cage of rats which 
included babies), that we had the wrong mix of male & female unrelated
folk living in the house (massachusetts 1800's cohabitation laws), and that
there was asbestos in the basement (which was, honestly, nice to know about).

I've never made a lot of noise in general about being pagan.  Most people 
don't cry their religion from the rooftops.  But this incident made me very
aware that scared, uneducated people do scary, ignorant things that can 
*hurt* you.

Ergo, I am very sincere.  I attend a (at least historically) protestant 
church, because I like the philosophy, the social context, and the people.
But I don't put bumper stickers on my car that say "{pentacle} clergy {pent-
acle}" any more than I would put up a bumpersticker that says "Jesus was
a good jewish boy who had trouble with the law."  Religion requires context
to be un-offensive, and offending people is not only rude but can be 
dangerous.

Subject: Comets

I believe that Comets is indeed the same game as Firepots, except that we
tend to play it in a rather rule-less fashion. Master Robert Whitcomb was
trying to explain the "correct" way to play Firepots to us a few months
ago, but things still tend to turn into something of a free-for-all, with
the rules changing every few minutes...

Is there a new volume of Beast out? I don't remember this sequence. For those
who haven't read them yet, I *strongly* recommend Lady Tudor-Glitz and Beast;
the former is the most on-target satire of the SCA around, and the latter is
a slightly gentler, but still very funny, satire.

sorry about the abrupt termination there, i'll try again

acctually the church cared quite a lot about the spiritual well being of the
peasantry.  Preists were given long lists of things which the church 
considered to be sinnfull that it might not occur to a peasant were wrong so 
that they could be conffessed and given absolution.  Things like flying at 
night with Dianna's hunt etc.  These are often a lot more helpfull in 
determining what pagan lingerings went on among the folk than are transcripts 
of heresy trials usw because they *were* concerned with the peoples spiritual 
health and not (so much) with maintaining OFFICIAL CHURCH DOCTRINE.

Subject: beliefs of the peasants

Greetings  Good Gentles.
I got the impression from the history classes I've had, and from my own
reading, that no, the nobility didn't worry about the beliefs of the
peasants too much.

But, yes, at the same time, they did.  If the beliefs of the peasants
did not interfere with the ruling of the rulers, the beliefs were
tolerated.  Rulers tend to be happy as long as the taxes roll in.

However, the religion of the ruler, tends to be the religion of the
ruled, especially within the context of the time period of sca.  For
instance, Russia became Christian when the Tsar said "ok, everybody's
Christian now"  and, within a generation or so, they were "real"
Christians, not just the sword-point variety.

Of course, if I'm really wrong in my analysis of how things worked,
please let me know.

	I would be willing to bet that these lists were from the time of the
"Malleus Maleficarum" (Latin for "Hammer of Witches") done by a couple of
really kinky Dominicans in the 1500s.  Most of the witch-burning in the Middle
Ages was pretty late, and extended into the modern, "post-Society" era -- the
1690s in America.
	Early in our period (1000s, if I remember correctly) a pope issued and
Encyclical explicitly condemning the belief in witches, goddesses, etc., as
being both heretical and nonsense.  It was only in the latter times, when the
Church was facing competition with Protestantism that witch-hunting became a
sport.  Before that time, it was a private enterprise, and not very prominent.

	Virtually all European nobility descends from one or another bunch of
pretty grungy characters who conquered the various countries -- the were the
horsey equivalent of today's Hell's Angels (or maybe vice-versa -- will the
H.A.s' descendants look down their noses at ours ???  :-)
	Most of them went through, raping, looting, sacking, and pillaging,
but some of them settled down --some because they liked the look of the place,
some because there was a good (or very bad) reason they couldn't go home, and
some, doubtless, because it seemed like the thing to do at the time.
	After a certain amount of time, the local King would get Christianized
(Clovis and the Franks, Aethel{somethingorother} in England, etc.), and would
then insist that the larger nobles do the same -- Christianity brought trade
with the richer areas.  If any of the nobles _wouldn't_ convert -- well, that
was as good an excuse as any to hit 'em over the head and appropriate their
lands and treasure.
	As for the peasants -- they got pretty short shrift.  Just think about the
general attitude of your local ("outlaw") motorcycle club towards "citizens",
and you'll get the general idea.  The Church baptized everybody, and paid
attention tothe people with "power" -- however that was defined.  The "power
elite" were trusted to handle everybody else.
	As late as the 1950s, the Roman Church's official attitude towards its
parishioners in the USA was: "Pray, pay, and obey -- or else goto Hell."  That
is still the attitude of the Curia in Rome, and I can't see that it was much
different any earlier.  (Even the pray was pretty much optional, as long as
they paid and obeyed -- considering that most bishops were nobles, this pretty
much reflects the attitudes of European society of the time . . .).

Subject:  Kudos; Games; Peasant activities; Magic moments in the SCA

Greetings!

Before addressing those topics I have in mind for this posting, I wish to
offer kudos unto Sam'l de Basset, William de Corbie, and many others for
their intelligent and informative commentaries on the religion topic.  And,
it's *so* nice that everyone's being civilized, instead of flaming each other!

GAMES:  my Barony, An Crosaire, originated a game called "Boppe ye
Hedgepigge".  To play, all participants stand in a circle and bat around a
small stuffed hedgehog.  This is done amidst much conversation, with *large*
dollops of silliness added!  (Don't knock it; it's proven to be an excellent
means of getting newcomers involved, and for getting to know one another!)

Another activity, which like the one above would be good for kids, are "Hobbye
Tourneys."  Participants enter the "lists" astride hobby-horses, or home-made
"hobby-beasties" of any sort.  They "tilt" at each other wearing cardboard
helms, and bearing cardboard heaters and well-padded boffle lances.  Again,
much silliness is called for.

RE:  PEASANT ACTIVITIES AND SOURCES THEREUPON:  the book Sam'l de Basset has
in mind should be Barbara Tuchman's _A_Distant_Mirror_.  Other books on the
"life cycle" of the peasantry are around, such as _Lost_Country_Life_ (I forget
the authors' names).  I couldn't say offhand which of these documents the
activities which have been indirectly referred to (such as copulating in the
sown fields to insure a good harvest), but I *do* know the documentation is
out there.

MY MOST MAGICAL MOMENT IN THE SCA:  was, I think, during the feast Sat. night
of the first Trimaris Principality Coronation.  My Barony and 2 other groups
co-autocratted, because Trimaris was so proud to be going Principality at last
that *everyone* wanted to pull out all the stops, and thoroughly gild the
lily!  So everyone was looking their best in all respects.  Then, once the
serving was under way, the lights were turned off.  For once, there was ample
candlelight available (the autocrats supplemented what the populace had
brought).  Nothing mundane was visible on the tables.  Suddenly, it all came
together; it was one of those moments when it all becomes real, and it is the
mundane world that seem to be the dream...

	Hmmm.  Seems the old Christian (or at least some branches of it)
statement that the translators/writers/whoever of the bible were "guided
by God" to produce a bible that is totally true could apply to people
trying to revive a religion as well.  (Southern Baptists (at least a large
portion of them) believe this about the bible.)

	Please note that what you're arguing is not the authenticity of the
ceremonies, etc, but the direct transmittal of them from the original
practitioners.

	Concerning what started this discussion, it is possible, though
unlikely, that some families (especially those that lived in isolated
sections of their respective homelands) might have become (and largely remained)
token christians: paying lip service (and tithes) to the church, while
retaining their previous religion (in perhaps a reduced, less-organized,
and quite possibly incomplete or modified form).  No religion remains totally
unchanged over long periods of time.  There is also the question of exactly
what is a religion, especially when the practitioner outwardly follows the
"required" religion of the state.  How many of the old practices are required
for it to still be the same religion?  When does a mixture of christianity and
xxxxx become christian and not xxxxx (think of all the older rituals still used
by "christian" people in different areas of the world)?

I know that here in An Tir, scrolls take a notoriously long time time to
come. So the Royalty have promissory scrolls made up (photocopied on
good-quality paper) with spaces left for the recipient's name, date and
Their Majesties' signatures. Receiving a promissory means that one day
(but don't hold your breath) you will get a scroll done by a kingdom scribe.

Aside: I've been at a few kingdom-level events where an AA scroll dated
from AS LongTimeAgo has been given to Count Master So-and-So among cheers
and laughter.

I've know of people who have received their scroll and for one reason or
another, have comissioned a scribe to re-do it. (eg. "We got our scrolls
before we were married and now we'd like our AA's to be a matched set.")

BINGO! This is the point exactly. I'll do it at least once because it's a
challenge to me, many times if I *really like doing it* but if it stops
being FUN I'll only do it again for money.

... So I suppose the trick is to find someone who considers the job to be
fun  :-).

I have a question about this game of catch called Comets.

T'other night, I was introduced to cartoon critter by the name of "Beast"
-- published by the same folks who put out "Lady Tudor Glitz". In one of
the cartoons, it showed people playing catch with what looked like balls
tied in cloth so that part of the cloth hung free like a tail. The idea
seemed to be that you caught and tossed the ball by it's "tail". I think
the game was called "Firepots". Is this the same as Comets?

Anyone care to post the rules/origins/interesting info on this/these games?

Ok - you're right.  Perhaps what I am saying is so far removed from 
"real possibility" as to be nearing the ridiculous, however, that 
wasn't my point.  My point, milord, was that it seems a little arrogant
to specify that "science" says it isn't so, so it doesn't exist.  The
act of saying 10 million people *can't* be wrong.  I'm saying that
it is _possible_, albeit unlikely, that claims of this sort are well
founded in fact.  I too, find it interesting that this claim is made
at all.  Perhaps, due to my own interests, I am "too willing to accept",
erring in the other direction.

Oh they're very sincere, but pagans don't seem to have the same "social

someday...

I was about to launch into a discussion on the viabilty of "proving" and
"measuring" a belief stucture, but I feel that would be inappropriate
to this forum.  Send me mail, if you'd like, and I'd be happy to continue.

Milord Sam'l de Bassett, I am most impressed by your recent postings on
religion. They ring of truth and a lot of common sense - and quite a large
amount of knowledge. Some comments though (I just can't shut up, can I?):

>Just because "no such thing is known to science" does that mean it
>doesn't exist?

You are absolutely right. Science doesn't know everything, and I'm glad that
you point this out. But we must be aware that some things can be examined
scientifically, others can't. Questions like "Does God exist?" are not 
accessible to science. But we *can* examine what people believe and how
religions function. This is a field which is accessible to science and where
extensive research is being done. I dare say that most groups, sects and
dogmas have been examined, and it would surprise me if a true Viking pagan
group had somehow escaped notice.

I won't go into a detailed account of my reasons for believing that the
modern Norse pagans can't be a surviving wing of the Viking religion. That
would become a too long posting... But let me say that my reasons involve:

1. What we know about the existence of pagans i Scandinavia after the
   Middle Ages. Small groups of pagans existed here as late as the 1600's,
   but their religion was *not* identical to ancient Viking paganism. This
   is a pretty firmly established fact.

2. What we know about emigration to America, i.e. the probability that an
   authentic Viking-pagan group could have survived here long enough to be
   able to emigrate there. Considering who, when and how many that emigrated,
   this is extremely unlikely.

3. What we know of the life expectancy of traditions that are handed down
   orally in a group of people. This depends on the size of the group, its
   geographical distribution, and the religious environment they exist in.
   That ancient Norse paganism should have survived intact since AD 1000,
   orally transmitted as family tradition, conflicts with everything science
   knows about how these things work.

4. What we know of the tendency for change in religious traditions, myths and
   legends when confronted with the forces of history. Even *within* the
   300-year Viking era, Norse religion changed quite a lot. Some deities
   rose in importance, others were forgotten. New myths came in from abroad
   and old ones split in different and contradictory versions. Christian ideas
   were absorbed, etcetera. This is what happens when you don't have scriptures
   and an official, centrally controlled clergy which is charged and trained
   to preserve the traditions. The beliefs of any surviving group would have
   undergone similar change over the 800 or 900 years which have passed since
   the end of Viking times. Do you honestly believe that it could be intact
   today?

5. My final reason for not believing the claims these people make is that
   there are so many other ways to explain their mythology and beliefs which
   are infinitely more plausible and reasonable. The concept of a surviving
   Viking religion is like the story about the man who found a secret valley
   where dinosaurs still lived - it's a nice plot for a fantasy novel, but it
   has little to do with reality. Dinosaurs are extinct, and so is Viking
   religion.

By the way, Corbie is a town in northern France. My persona was raised there,
hence the name. It's not because of the ravens. Someday I may tell the story
of how Corbie got its name...

This is one of the oldest traps in the book.  Abscence of evidence is not
evidence of absence.  That there is no record does *not* show that there
must have been pagans in high places.  It only leaves us with the records
we have--and those will show the nobility being obedient members of the
church.  The available data suggests--things like the Abigensian Crusade--
that any "heresy" discovered would have been wiped out *and* *records* *of*
*that* *destrcution* *would* *survive.*  While the lack of records does 
not constitute "proof", it becomes compelling evidence that there were
no closet pagans.  Or do you believe that over all the time involved
*every* such person kept the secret perfectly?

Please check on what was done (and tolerated) in Greenland after the
area was converted to Christianity.  (I will also stipulate that Iceland
and Greenland and the rest of Scandinavia later constitute one of the
most tolerant and enlightened groups in many ways and that they were
exceptions to the usual rule--up to and including the settlement of
the British North American colonies.)


This *entire* discussion shows why the Society has to be so careful
around religous issues.  It must be quite an eye opener for our 
members who grew up in Drachenvald.

An the events I witnessed in An Tir, a set of boffer swords, maces, and
blunderbusses :-) placed strategically in the center of a convenient open
space instantly drew not only a horde of smalls, but stick jocks of all ages.
Of course, this would require supervision, but it also may get some
interested in fighting who were not already.

Subject: Boring chainmail

An anecdotal suggestion, for relieving the boredom of chainmail manufacture...

One friend of mine, several years back, was making a chainmail hauberk for
another friend. As anyone who makes chain knows, this is a pretty big project,
especially as one's first. Well, she found that the best way to get the job
along was to take the equipment along to all the parties and post-revels she
went to, and take clear joy in the manufacture. Inevitably, someone would
say, "Wow, that's neat; how do you make that?". She would show them, and
ask if they would like to try it. This would lead to more inquiries, and, by
the end of the evening, she would have *lots* of fresh links. Those of us
who hung out with her started calling the hauberk "The Carolingian White
Fence". (Think Twain).

Oh, and an apology to all -- the Rolls have been delayed a couple of weeks.
I was plagued by computer troubles on the weekend I set aside to do the
data entry, and now have to fit it around all the other things in my 
schedule. It is being worked on, really!

Subject: my opinions on the religion discussion

Having followed the religious discussion that has been going on with
some interest, and reading m'lord Sam'l Bassett's comments of today, I
finally decided it was time for me to put in my two cents worth (now
that I have gotten my demon box to obey my commands).I think that this
whole bit has gotten, perhaps, a bit out of hand.  I don't see the
problem if someone practices their chosen religion, if it is done in
good taste, and not forced upon someone else.  I also dont see why such
practices cannot be announced.

 Here in the the incipient canton of the
College of the Northern Highlands, our Lord Abbot, and our Prioress, and
I recently had a fun religious argument.  I, being a paganish
viking-type, was wearing a cross, and was not christian.  They were
threatening to try to convert me, and I was resisting on the basis that
I wanted the favor of as many gods as possible.

 My point is this:  We were having fun, and nobodys toes were stepped on,
  yet we were of different religiouns, and following them.

Maybe its because that here in the Highlands we have a somewhat large
percentage of non-christians in the group, due to an eclectic mix of
personae.  I think, though, that most people in SCA are similar, being
pretty tolerant, and there are only a minority out there who dislike
other religions.  At least thats what I hope.  If I cant follow my
persona's chosen religion (or best recreation thereof possible), in a
polite, un-obtrusive way, then what is the point of having such a persona?
If we end up with no hint of any religion in SCA whatsoever, its going to
get boring, and leave out a big piece of period life.

 My apologies for the length of this, I tend to get carried away at times.

Do you have any support for this?  It's quite counter to anything I've read or

Subject: More on what the scribes do -- and don't

I've been following the discussion on charging for services with great interest.
In #273 (I think), Robyn (Dave Rubin) mentioned that one could get an AoA for
free, but that other awards were commissioned (that is, you paid for them).  Is
that the custom in Ansteorra, or elsewhere?  Here in the Eastrealm, things are
a little different.

All award scrolls in this kingdom are gifts to the recipients, though in special
cases one might be reimbursed (by an individual, not by the kingdom) for any
exotic or expensive materials used.  The Tyger Clerk tries to match up assigned
scrolls with calligraphers who know the recipient well, so the scroll often
takes on the character of a personal gift from the scribe as well as an award
from the Kingdom.  I know that if a buddy of mine were to be knighted or given
a peerage, that I would happily arm-wrestle the other scribes to be able to do
that scroll.  I've done such things for certain AoAs, too.  There is no money
involved at any time, even for vellum and gold leaf.  The calligraphy is my
gift.

On promissory notes: Malice basically has the right idea.  Promissory notes are
given when an award has been planned to be given at an event, but the scroll
itself is either not done, not assigned (last-minute awards are like that), or
didn't make it to the event for some reason.  Most of the time, the scroll has
been assigned and you will receive it when it's finished (or when it reaches
their Majesties; these things sometimes get delayed in the mail).  Sometimes
the scroll was not assigned, and you can take your note to the Tyger Clerk or
to a friendly scribe and ask for the scroll to be done.  The scribe, in either
case, does not charge to do the scroll.  It is considered very nice to bribe
him/her, but the word "thanks" will do wonders.

Vnend: So sorry to hear about your AoA scroll.  Quality is another soapbox of
mine, and one I won't get into here.  Please contact me privately, and I'll
redo your scroll quietly.  Unless the original scribe visits your house, no one
need ever know.  Of course, the signatures will be on the original...

To all the royalty and prospective royalty reading this posting: Please don't
sign your award scrolls in felt-tip anything!  The ink disappears completely in
less than 10 years.

That's enough babbling for now.  Thanks for bearing with me.

care about what the peasants believed, but for the most part, serfs and cattle
were thought about alike until the Black Death ran up the price of labor.
