Milord Fred,

I have attempted to reach you via email and farspeaker, to no avail.  This
machine has been suffering from a split personality and has not been allowing
me to get my mail out.  We were discussing 1) Your offer to get info on the
Marklanders for my map of atlantia, 2) a contact person so that I could get
hold of the Marklanders myself.

Thank you for your cooperation.  BTW, I expect to be at the Baron and Baroness
Lochmere tourney shooting to be the Baroness Champion.  It's in Owings Mills,
Maryland.

Unto all who wrote asking for a copy of Chainmail Mama, fear not, it's coming.
I hope to get to the copier this weekend (I failed to reach it last weekend)
and put them in the mail.  I have attempted to send email to everyone I've
received a missive from, but most of my mail has been coming back to me.  If
you don't get hard copy in a about a week, let me know, as it should be out by

As promised, I'm putting another song on the Rialto.  It's an oldy but goody.


Seven Old Ladies

Chorus:
And it's oh dear, what can the matter be?
seven old ladies got stuck in the lavat'ry,
they were there from Sunday till Saturday
Nobody knew they were there.

Verses:
The first old lady was Jennifer Prim,
She went in on a personal whim,
She got herself stuck betwixt bowl and the rim,
and nobody knew she was there

The second old lady was old Mrs Humphrey,
When she went in, she made herself comfey,
When she trid to get up, she couldn't get her bum free,
and nobody knew she was there.

The third old lady was Chit Chester's daughter
She went in to get rid of some water,
She very near drownded, for the rising tide caught her,
and nobody knew she was there.

The fourth old lady was skinny Miss Boulder,
She sat on the throne, there was no one to hold her,
Quick as a flash she was up to her shoulder,
and nobody knew she was there

The fifth old lady was old Mrs  Craper,
When she went she couldn't find the paper,
the only thing there was a bricklayers scraper,
and nobody knew whe was there

Teh sixth old lady was old Mrs Mason
She had to be quick, so she used the basin,
And that was the water that I washed me face in !
And I didn't know she'd been there.

The seventh old lady was old Mrs Bender,
She went in to adjust a suspender,
She got herself entangled with the masculine gender,
nobody knew I was there.

Yours in service to musical mayhem,

BaShem HaShem HaRachmon. Unto the Gentles of the Rialto may this missive find
you in good health and spirits. MaAyt Shel- Yonatan Moshe Bereb Avram Yitzhak.

I would like to express my pleasant surprise at all the requests that are
arriving for the reference materials I offered. It is always nice to find
other people who are actively pursuing knowledge in the SCA. Mistress Cher
and I are putting together a listing so that materials can be mass mailed,
please have patience we will send all soon. (Cher don't look at me like that...
Cher put down the sword....  CHER!  :) To the enterprising West Kingdom type
who called me, and whose name I have forgotton, please remember that in
the mundane world there are such things as time zones. Yes, it REALLY was
2 am. Please, no calls after 9pm my time.

I have been asked by their Excellencies Baron Elom and Baroness Ara of An
Crosaire to enlist the aid of the People of the Rialto in locating Viscount
Guthram of the Wastelands and Viscountess Ursula Katze (mka: Ken Purdin and
Collie Collier). They were last seen speeding off towards Texas, although
rumour has it (he does does he?! :) that they may not have gotten the brakes
to work untill they reached California. Their friends would like assurances
that they are still alive, active, etc.  We greatly appreciate any assistance.

BaShem HaShem HaRachmon. Unto the Gentles of the Rialto may this missive find
you in good health and spirits. MaAyt shel- Yonatan Moshe Bereb Avram Yitzhak.

Gentles, I must crave your indulgence the following discussion is unpleasant.

I have been asked by several members of the peerage and general members of the
Barony An Crosaire to inquire as to the ability of local groups to bar or
remove disruptive members from attending meetings.  For the past 2 years a
situation has continued in the Barony with a few members who attend meetings
specifically to verbally attack, slander, and harass other members. These
individuals have been asked to keep their comments civil, but they
invariably do not. They have physically attempted to intimidate disagreeing
members (short of actual violence). The Crown has been most helpful, but
accurately sees this as a Baronial matter and would like to leave it to
the Barony to handle. They have agreed to back the Barony in whatever course
is necessary. Are there any hard and factual instances that may be used for
precedent -- emphasis on fact, the individuals believe in court actions as
a viable means to harass/intimidate.  The situation has gotten bad enough
that at least one victim may seek civil redress. The Barony is already
taping all of its meetings as a means of securing an unbiased account, but
one of the "problems" has already altered his personal copy of the tapes
and attempted to pass it off as the real thing. Luckily, the individuals
he tried this on already had copies of the uncut original...  As I said,
very very unpleasant.
I apologize for airing this on the Rialto, but I was commanded to place this
before you. I thank you on behalf of the Barony.

You're confused. The fact that MINTAKA is MXing for MC means that
MINTAKA is willing to accept mail for MC mailboxes, which is to say
mail in which the SMTP RCPT-TO field specifies an address on MC.  Had
you tried "VRFY SCA-REQUEST@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU" or "VRFY DANA@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU",
MINTAKA would happily have agreed to deal with it.
 
All of which is to say that if your mailer understands MX records you
can send mail to SCA-REQUEST@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU (or for that matter
DANA@AI.AI.MIT.EDU, wihch is taking a smiliar path) just fine.
 
If your mailer -doesn't- understand MX records, -and- you can't use
the SCA-REQUEST%MC@MINTAKA.LCS.MIT.EDU syntax, then, well, we
sympathize, but we can't help you right at the moment.

[To Danulf -- I'm mailing this to sca-request so that you can stop it if you
 suddenly get a flood of old articles from ohio-state.]

Well, it looks like the alt.sca -> mailing list gateway has gone down again,
and we are missing out on the interesting discussion happening over there.
Therefore, I'm starting up alt.sca digest again, manually collecting the
articles that I see on alt.sca and not on the mailing list. I will try to
put the articles into a format acceptable for automatic de-digestifiers;
if it isn't right, could someone who understands *exactly* what the correct
format is please write to me?

(Sorry for the lack of normal headers; this is being pulled from a "notes"
 system, which doesn't retain them...)

The following are the messages that have arrived at inmet in alt.sca in the
past two days (June 1 and 2). Note that the gateway has been down for at
least five days, so there are some discussions in progress here that haven't
been seen on the mailing list. My apologies if there are any duplicates
between this and stuff that has appeared on the list; I've tried to avoid
duplicates, but nobuddy's poifect...

	I seriously doubt that a pentacle, qua pentacle (it's a mullet,
remember) would have gotten a Herald or a Churchman in 1200 at all
exercised.  It wasn't a symbol of anything in particular until _much_
later -- I would guess the 1600s.

	Thor hammers (Mjollnir), stag's heads, boar's heads, etc., are
pretty common, and they were clan/tribal totems from pagan times (and
still are, among the German Jaeger societies -- but that's another
story).

	The pentacle as a general symbol of paganism is strictly
post-Gardnerian (i.e. after 1950), and, as far as I can tell, the
reversed pentacle with a goat's head is Victorian -- Eliphas Levi, et
al., though it _may_ go back to the mid-1600s (diabolism & balck masses
in the Court of Louis XIV in France).

	Faced with a large, hairy, and possibly violent "nobleman" in
1200, saying "I wan _dat_ _ting_ on mah shield!!!", the average Herald is
going to have said: "Yes, your Grace!!!"  At most he would have said:
"But yr Grace, Count Bloodspatter of Runningore, two valleys over, is
using that, and a noble like yourself wouldn't want to be mistaken for
_HIM_, would you???"

The argument here, that in period the heralds didn't tell the nobles
what to do, is a difficult one to refute.  However, historical
evidence certainly points to the contrary.  Heraldry was born in the
late 12th century, and spread throughout France and western Germany
remarkably fast: 50 years after the first surviving evidence of
heraldic usage (stained glass of Geoffrey of Anjou), there are
hundreds of examples of heraldry throughout the area of modern France,
Belgium, and Holland.  Furthermore, the range of charges used was
motably small: The standard ordinaries, the lion, and the eagle
account for the great majority of all early heraldic insignia.
Indeed, this limited range lasted well into the medieval period.  An
ordinary of pre-1400 rolls of arms shows very few odd charges.  Most
of the unusual charges found were certainly adopted for canting
purposes.

The conclusion is either that nobles DID let the heralds tell them
what was supposed to be in heraldry, or that social convention
dictated that certain things were acceptable and others were not.
Arms were adopted by nobles because they were the new, stylish, and
accepted symbol of nobility: A lord had arms, and his arms were the
evidence that he was noble (and were often accepted as such without
further support!)  To adopt odd armory, out of the prevailing style,
would be to exclude the bearer from the noble clique defined by
armory, which is certainly a goal no noble would pursue.

My Lady,

When making your case to the royalty for someone to be Baron/ess, always give
them both the good and bad points of that person as objectively as you can.
There is a good chance that the crown will have no idea who you are talking
about and will be depending entirely on the reccommendations they receive
to make their decision. (Then there are those of us who remember the days
when you really did know everyone in the kingdom)

On another note:

This past weekend, in the Barony of Concordia of the Snows, was held
The War of the Roses.  The winner of the Tourney was Duke Sir Sigfreid
VonHolstern (ya, da dook is back) for Lancaster (Red Rose).
The Battle of Bosworth field was won by the forces of York (White Rose)
The woods battle and the archery point were won by the House of Lancaster.
The weather was great if you like flying kites. The ground was fine if you
like swamps.  A good time was had by all (I can't remember her name 8-{))

On monday as I was packing up under perfect weather (it figures), I was

as Niccolette Bonhomme (I never could spell) who had been tryiny to put a face
to my name all weekend.  My Lady, the pleasure was mine.
For the rest of you on the rialto, if you see a large red and white wagon

Thank you for the explanation; you undoubtedly have the right of it.
But, what *about* the furs?  It was always my assumption that a fur is
treated as a color, unless reversed, whence it becomes a metal.  (Vair
is a problem in this regard, being neatly half&half.)  Is this not correct?
And if so, what rules govern use of furs?

Greetings from Arval.

His Grace Duke Cariadoc asks, of SCA, Inc. membership:

> But why should people be required to send tribute? Why (in the context of

I find several reasons to encourage, or even require membership for
certain forms of participation in the Society.  None of these ideas
are original, but it seems worth putting them all down in one place.

As has oft been noted, the SCA is almost unique in that it does not
require membership, or anything else beyond an attempt to dress
medieval, for participation in its events.  This fact is not a reason
to require membership, but it does suggest that older, established
groups have found it a beneficial requirement.

The reasons are practical.  There are certain expenses associated with
running the SCA, both on the national and local level.  Insurance,
legal representation, office expenses, and the like are necessary, and
have to come from somewhere.  The larger the organization, the higher
these costs rise.  We need insurance, for example, to cover everyone
who participates in an SCA event, not just members.  Is it fair to
extend these services to people unwilling to make a minimal monetary
commitment to the organization?  One can cite similar expenses closer
to the medieval activity of the SCA: Running the SCA marshallate, and
publishing rules of the lists; Running BoD meetings; Running the SCA
Chirurgeonate.  Each of these bodies serves everyone who attends SCA
events, and each has to be supported by SCA membership fees.

On a more philosophical level, there is the argument that membership
demonstrates a basic commitment to the SCA.  Running Pennsic War, to
address the original topic of this discussion, is an enormous amount
of work.  I help do it because I enjoy it, but I would enjoy it just
as much if the War were smaller, and I would find it much more
satisfying if I knew that everyone for whose benefit I scream my lungs
out year after year was a real SCA member, not just a summer weekend
groupie.  Why should I (and the several hundred other folk who help
run the War) expend all this effort for someone who doesn't even care
enough to find $6.00 (or $20, for that matter) per year to support the
SCA?  

SCA dues are not "tribute to the West", and I strongly recommend that
we avoid that idea; they are payment to help run the organization.
Membership requirements are not intended to increase the income of the
corporation; they are meant to discourage people who are not really
interested in the SCA, and who make work, expense, and trouble for
those of us who are.  Personally, I cannot understand how anyone can
actively participate in the SCA without maintaining membership: It is
discourteous, if nothing else.

What exactly is meant by a "divine being"?  Suppose I happened to
believe (person, persona, or both) that the putative divine being Thor
did/does not exist (it's nothing but heathen lies, etc)?

Suppose I happened to believe in the divinity of a goddess named
Elizabeth, does this mean nobody can use Elizabeth as a Society name?

Suppose I could document period belief in the divinity of a god(dess)
named Elizabeth?

I'd assume the name is related to the goddess', simply because it's a
plausible theory and I lack any other plausible theories.  (I'm
assuming I'd never seen your message, of course.)  Given the rules
which (tend to) prohibit taking gods'/goddess' names for personas, I
would wonder, which may lead to questioning of this theory.

In your case, of course, the surname makes it fairly clear this isn't
the case.

/* ---------- "The fair folk" ---------- */
I'm currently researching early period Irish garb (there was supposed to
be a really definitive article on the subject by Aeruin ni Hearain (sp?)
aka Pat Pierce.  It was back somewhere in the vicinity (+/- 3 years) of 1983.
I went to Michael Fenwick's house (he's been in the Society forever) and
together we rummaged through about thirty of the TIs and couldn't find it.
(Aside:  If anyone can tell me which issue of the TI and the title of the
article, I would appreciate it). 

While in this process, I found many interesting articles that I hadn't
meant to find (on such topics as weight training for fighters and how to
brew beer (This topic really excites me... They say an Irishman will climb
over the bodies of fifty naked women to get to a glass of stout).  One of the
articles mentioned Irish clothing styles (but was not by Aeruin) and mentioned
that popular colors for the brat (semi-circular or triangular Irish cloak that
covers most of the body) were red or purple, green being the color of the Sidhe
(mound-dwellers.  My pet theory is that they were the people who dwelt in the
land before the Celts came in, and they used the neolithic mounds as refuge.
Green, no doubt, helped them blend in with the scenery.)

Is green therefore an unpopular/unlucky color for early period Irish?  Or am
I reading too much into the reference?

Yes, I've seen it stated several times.

It doesn't make sense.

I don't know the reasons that children without parents are not allowed
at Pennsic and I don't belong to the SCA.  However, I am a parent, of 
four children, and we live in Pennsylvania.

This year all four of them will be at camp without us.  The older two will
be away for three weeks.  The younger two will be away for two one week
sessions.  All four have been going to various camps (scout, gifted, 
science, etc) since we moved here in 1985.

They have also attended a variety of overnight and week long camps and
other outings with scouts and school groups during the year.

For all of them we sign a form giving permission for emergency medical
care as needed, before they ever go.  We sign similar forms for the schools
every year, for their various daycare arrangements, and even for short
outings with groups like the girl scouts.  I have signed so many of them
I could recite one in my sleep.

And yes, our children have been treated, more than once, without our prior
explicit permission beyond what's on the form. 

So whatever the reasons are (and my suspicion is that they DO have to do
with behavior, control and responsibility) the above, at least as stated,
may be a convenient excuse but it doesn't hold up.

We lose the claim to be an educational medieval-recreation group.  We
might gain something simultaneously.  I received a letter from my
brother (who's been to perhaps a dozen events) a few weeks ago
outlining his ideas for the Society for Even More Creative Anachronism,
whose time period is around the time of the United Federation of
Planets or the Terran Empire or what you will; the local groups in
SEMCA become planets, each with their own culture, native political
systems, economic systems, attire, cookery, architecture, etc.  The
criterion for acceptability is not "can you document the use of that
embroidery stitch in County Whosiswhat in 1282?" but "does it work?"
Less of an emphasis on research and more on invention.
    In the spirit of this criterion, I don't think it would work.
Yes, we have immensely creative people in the Society, but they're
also staunchly individualistic, and I suspect each planet would
develop such a hodgepodge of incompatible styles that any illusion of
living on Planet Outer Bango-bango would be hard to maintain.  As it
is, we have an arbiter in the historical record, rather than the
members of each planet spending thousands of hours arguing about which
way to design their planet (Instead, they only spend hundreds of hours
arguing about what the historical record says :)  In any case, if
the SEMCA experiment is ever tried, I think it should be kept carefully
separated from the SCA experiment so we can read the results and tell
what they mean.

The difference, my lady, is that commercial organizations like the Boy
Scouts and summer camps, and government organizations like schools
have access to insurance that the SCA and the Coopers simply cannot
afford.  Pennsic War is held at a private camp ground.  It isn't a Boy
Scout camp or a commercial summer camp, and the owners do not have
insurance to cover unsupervised children.  Their insurance company has
told them that they must ban children without parents, pets, and other
insurance risks.  Furthermore, to be fair, even if the Coopers could get
that kind of insurance, there is no good reason for them to pay for it.

/* ---------- "Feeding Fighters" ---------- */
Re:  Feeding Fighters.

OK, first hand experience.  Since I'm a fighter, and I bring all my
own food/camping gear/armor/etc., to events and have for years.
This weekend was Egil's, in An Tir, a three day event, I brought:

1 Ice Chest w/
2 lbs of roast beef (cooked and sliced at home)
1 lb  of sliced turkey (from a deli I like)
1/2 lb Canadian Bacon
1 lb of various cheeses
Coke, Milk, Juices, Beer
Seasonings, Mustard, etc.

Also, Bread and Rolls.

Nothing else to eat.  Also, no stove.  I do bring a stove sometimes,
but this event I caught a ride, and wanted to save space.  Also, I
sometimes bring cookables and then borrow a stove or firepit.  The
most important thing I've learned is figure out how much you need to
bring, and then don't overpack.  Don't bring a gallon if all you
need is a quart.

I had left overs this weekend since I got dinner given to me on both
Saturday and Sunday, which I hadn't planned on (but is fairly
common).  Also, I traded my Canadian Bacon for breakfast on Sunday.

My method works great when you travel alone, as you never go hungry.
However, meals may not be very exciting either.  But I have a lot of
other things to worry about (armor, etc) so I can't spend all my
time cooking.

/* ---------- "Minors at Pennsic, Membership requi" ---------- */
"If you are under 18 and are injured, no matter where you are in America,
you can NOT be treated for ANYTHING until your legal guardians/parents
give the ok." (Cynthia du Pre Argent)

"The problem is largely that in Pennsylvania (and many Eastern states)
medical care *cannot* be given to a minor without the express written (and
specific) consent of his/her legal parents or guardians. Many states have
a provision for the appointment of a temporary guardian, and it is simpler
in some places than others. In some states, a simple notarized letter
would do..." (Li Kung Lo)

"However, I am a parent, of four children, and we live in Pennsylvania.
This year all four of them will be at camp without us. ... For all of them
we sign a form giving permission for emergency medical care as needed,
before they ever go.... And yes, our children have been treated, more than

must ban children without parents, pets, and other insurance risks. 
Furthermore, to be fair, even if the Coopers could get that kind of
insurance, there is no good reason for them to pay for it." (Arval).

I am quoting from all of these postings because they illustrate a very
common pattern in SCA discussions (and elsewhere). The sequence starts
with a confident, authoritative statement, which seems to settle the
matter: "no matter where you are in America, you can NOT be treated for
ANYTHING." It turns out from the second, and considerably more detailed
statement, that the first is false--or at least Li Kung Lo, who sounds
rather better informed than the previous poster, says that it is ("In some
states, a simple notarized letter would do..."). 

We then get evidence that seems to clearly contradict both statements--if
"medical care *cannot* be given to a minor without the express written
(and specific) consent of his/her legal parents or guardians (Li Kung Lo)"
then it cannot be given to a minor attending a summer camp or a boy scout
camp, both private organizations with the same legal rights as the
Coopers. If, as Paula Matuszek says (and she is the first participant in
the discussion to offer evidence instead of assertion), her children were
so treated, then both Cynthia du Pre Argent and Li Kung Lo are wrong--or
at least are seriously overstating the real situation.

Finally, we get a new assertion by Arval, equally authoritative, equally
confident that he is right, and again without evidence.

Summer camps as I remember them have a few hundred kids and are open from
one to two months. Pennsic runs about a week, and must average about
3000-4000 people during that week. It is by no means obvious which is the
bigger enterprise, hence not obvious that, in Arval's words, "summer camps
.. have access to insurance that the SCA and the Coopers simply cannot
afford."

My point here is not that the rule against minors is wrong. I simply do
not know enough about either the legal situation or the costs of different
kinds of insurance to say whether version three of the
"absolutely-confident-how could-anyone-but-an-idiot-disagree" explanation
of why minors without their parents are not permitted at Pennsic is
actually a reasonable defense. Neither, so far as I can tell, does anyone
who has yet contributed to the argument.

I have spent so much space on this question because it is something that
appears again and again--authoritative statements about why we have to do
something in a particular way, frequently statements about the law by
non-lawyers, accompanied by no evidence and often wrong. When the issue
was women fighting, the assertion was that we would be in violation of
civil rights law unless we permitted it. I checked that twice with
competent professionals, who both assured me that there was no truth to
it. When TYC was being organized, it was announced that selling food on
site (by SCA people) would not be permitted. I tried to see if something
could be done about that, in the hope that we could get something like the
old Sated Tyger (period food, produced and sold on a large scale). I was
told, by one of the organizers, that it was absolutely impossible because
of peculiarities of Texas law, and (in print, in the TYC newsletter) that
my suggestion that the real reason might be that the proprietor of the
site wanted to keep the business for his concessionaires was paranoid. I
arrived at TYC to find that there was one group of SCA people who were
making and selling food. I asked them about it, and was told that it was
all right because what they sold did not compete with what the
concessionaires sold!

My general conclusion is that, unless you know your source to be reliable,
you should give very little credence to assertions on such matters (or on
other matters, such as questions of authenticity), and less weight the
more confidently they are made. One should be particularly skeptical of
versions of "we are only doing this because someone else makes us." They
may be true, but they should not be taken on faith. 

On to another subject.

"Running Pennsic War, to address the original topic of this discussion, is
an enormous amount of work. ... Why should I (and the several hundred
other folk who help run the War) expend all this effort for someone who
doesn't even care enough to find $6.00 (or $20, for that matter) per year
to support the SCA?"

While I appreciate Arval's feeling, I have a problem with his logic. He
seems to be assuming his conclusion--that paying for a membership is the
proper test of whether you "care enough." One of our local people was not
a member at the point when he "cared enough" to autocrat a crown tourney.
Later, at a point when he was a member but his lady was not, he cared
enough to offer that, if our free event cost us more than we had in our
treasury, he would make up the difference (he is employed but not rich).
Following Arval's logic, shall I conclude that anyone who cares less than
this gentleman should be banned from Pennsic? That he is "not really
interested in the SCA, and ... make(s) work, expense, and trouble for
those of us who are."?

Arval has a better point when he argues that part of the membership goes
for things, such as insurance, that benefit all participants, whether or
not they are members, and that it is therefore both fair and reasonable to
pressure participants to be members. This immediately raises the question
of how much of the membership goes for insurance. If the answer is close
to six dollars, Arval has a reasonable argument; if it is close to fifty
cents, he does not. Does he know which it is? I don't.

Of course, Arval wants to include, in addition to insurance, a lot of
administrative overhead. That is the point at which we may disagree about
whether we are buying a good or a bad. While the central organization
undoubtedly does some useful things, I believe it also has substantial
undesirable effects. One (very period) way of minimizing them is to keep
it poor--by requiring that it, like the rest of the organization, run on
volunteer labor and a shoestring. This could become a long argument, so I
will save examples and further points for a later round.

There is a second issue that the question of participants getting a free
ride on members raises. The Society survives and prospers, in large part,
because many of us do things from which others benefit. Arval's work at
Pennsic is a good example--and one not paid for from memberships. I could
list quite a lot of others. The Society is run on donated volunteer labor,
not cash--our feasts are not cooked, our clothes are not made, our poems
are not written, by people hired with money from memberships. I think it
entirely reasonable that people who have been in for some time and do not
contribute to the Society should be treated with less regard than those
who do--and, as a rule, they are. I simply do not see that membership has
much to do with contribution.

I apologize for having left this impression.  My statement on the
question of minors at Pennsic is a summary of past conversations with
two Pennsic autocrats and with the Coopers.  I do not know whether or
not the content is correct.  I do know that this is the explanation
given by those who should know.

Your Grace, we clearly disagree on this point.  I believe that
membership in the SCA, Inc. is the only objective measure.  I will
certainly agree that in the past, membership in the SCA has had little
to do with participation, and that many exemplary members of the
Society have deliberately or accidentally failed to maintain
membership.  My point is that this attitude should change.
Furthermore, if we are put in a position of having to restrict Pennsic
attendance, for example, then SCA membership seems to me the only
logical grounds on which to do so.

Greetings Milord,

    Forgive me, as I have yet to don armour and take to the field, but
I have started paying close attention to the advice of those that have.
I understand that the "strap-of-choice" here in An Tir is that of the 
paratrooper (I know, too modern :-) - ie.  connected to the helm just
behind the ear, with a split chin strap.  - Have you tried this?

    Speaking of Helms - just for giggles - has anyone tried using

Note that I did NOT object to the rule, nor do I feel that Coopers or Pennsic
have any obligation to be responsible for our children.  I simply stated that
as it has been presented several times in this group the rationale doesn't 
make sense.  I don't object to people banning unaccompanied minors, I object 
to them making arbitrary statements which are inaccurate.  

If I were an SCA member I would also feel uncomfortable about being presented 
with such a statement as justification for a policy which must otherwise be
justified on grounds of "this is more hassle than we're prepared to deal
with", but I'm not, so it's not really my business.  Inaccurate information
being spread over the net about medical treatment for kids in the state I 
live in is just enough my business to drive me to post.

And in case it isn't clear already, I DON'T object to the rule, and I DO feel
that the SCA and the Coopers have every right to declare that it's more hassle
than they want to deal with.

Unto Yakov of An Tir

My messages kept bouncing off the daemon.  One Crown Lyst is held on
Memorial Day.  Its conjugate Coronation is held on Labor day.  The other
Lyst is held sometime in November with the Coronation occurring in
late February/early March.  That gives six months between Coronations and
3 months between the Lyst and its Coronation (more or less).



Speaking of Memorial day in Trimaris...  The Trimaris Memorial Tourney (TMT)
also known as Crown Lyst, was fought this weekend.  Lord Llewellen ap

like being *lied* to.  If the reason is insurance--then that should
be given as the reason.  If the reason is Penna. state law, then that
is the reason.  State law we can't do much about, but insurance can be
had if we're willing to pay the cost--and the Society *does* have
insurance--a considerable amount of it. (And that's *another* reason
for poeple to send that money to the Registry--that insurance protects
*you* too!)  I think you'll find that the Coopers are well covered, too.
If they are acting under advice--or without it for that matter--then that
is their decision.  What can be done is to ask them what the policy would
be if the *Society* purchased liability coverage for the event.  If the
answer is that they still don't want the kids--then the problem is something
*other* than insurance.  In general--I suspect that the fear is the
trouble that a lot of unchaperoned teens can get into.  It may well
be that what is needed is a policy that permits minors who are *members*
or accompanied by *members* in.  The flip side of this is: Do any
significant number of *local* *non-SCA* youths show up?  If so--are
they a problem?  My experience is that the kids--of all ages--that
are "raised" in the Society are, on the whole, better behaved than those
who aren't.  

Is there any objection to such a scheme from the younger commentators
on the Rialto?  If you're members--you could come.  If you're not,
you could either join--it'll cost you $6--or come with a member of the
Society who knows you.  Is this a hardship?  (In any case, *sonmebody*
has to have a copy of your medical release if you are minor not with a
parent or guardian, so this represents the *normal* way for you come!)

	Hmmm...  I stand corrected (and somewhat enlightened).  I was
under the impression that heraldry came to be used in the time of Henry I
of England -- Geoffrey of Anjou was earlier, no?

	I will buy the arguement of fashion -- "Your Grace, _every_
nobleman in France now has Arms emblazoned on his shield, and here are
the latest patterns out of Calais . . ."  I am not aware of churchly
prohibitions of any particular symbols, however.

- - - - - - - - - - - - 

	I'm all for canting arms -- I was Randall's Serjeant At Arms when my
device was approved . . .

- - - - - - - - - - - -

	Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't the really odd charges and
field divisions come in _after_ our period (i.e. late 1600s - 1700s)?
The less said about Regency and Early Victorian heraldry the better . . .

- - - - - - - - - - - -

	My favorite blazon was that of Henrik of Havn's long-time Queen
(but not, from reports, SO):

	Vert, a Unicorn Sable, armed, langued, maned, (etc), and hung,
Or.  Colorful arms, and an equally colorful blazon.

	I would be much disappointed if a quest for authenticity led to
and insistence on pedesrtian blazons . . .

)				-- Elton

	Current rules are:

AR1. 	Rule of Contrast.  Dark tinctures shall not be placed upon dark 
	tinctures nor light tinctures upon light.  Color-fielded ermine
	furs may be combined with other dark tinctures where contrast is
	maintained.  Proper charges must always have sufficient contrast.

	a. Definitions. Dark tinctures are colors (e.g.,sable), color-fielded
	ermine furs (e.g.,azure ermined Or), and dark proper (e.g., wood 
	proper).  Light tinctures are metals (e.g.,Or), metal-fielded furs
	(e.g., ermine), and pale proper (e.g.,stone proper).  Neutral tinctures
	are multiply divided fields of light and dark tinctures (e.g., lozengy
	gules and argent), vair furs (e.g.,vair), and even mixes of light and
	dark proper (e.g.,a zebra proper).  Fields with treatments (e.g., 
	argent masoned sable) are the same as the underlying field.
	b. Scope. The Rule of Contrast applies to all heraldic submissions
	(devices, badges, mon, etc.) and to all charges on those submissions
	(including chiefs, bordures, flaunches, labels, augmentations, marks
	of cadency, etc.) even though this is contrary to mundane practice in
	some systems of heraldry.
	c. Neutral Contrast. Neutral tinctures may be used with any metal,
	color, or fur except either of the component tinctures.  They may be
	used with the component tinctures only in simple cases.
	d. Contrast with Ermine Furs. Certain ermine-based furs with color
	fields have been specifically ruled to have sufficient contrast with
	some colors.  A color charge may be placed on a color field it at least
	one of the colors has a pattern of metal ermine spots, and the colors
	are chosen from following combinations: gules +{sable,vert,azure},
	sable+{gules,vert).  

AR2.	Rules of Party Fields and Charges.
	a. Combination Limit. Fields or charges parted with one of the 
	following lines of division may be tinctured as any combination
	of light, dark, and neutral tinctures: Per pale, Per fess, Per bend
	(sinister), Per chevron (inverted), Per pall (inverted), Quarterly,
	Per saltire.  Except for gyronny (noted below), all other divided
	fields shall not use combinations drawn solely from the same class
	of tincture. 
	b. Gyronny. Gyronny of 6 or 8 may be only light + dark, neutral +
	{light,dark}, or composed of a sufficient-contrast combination, 
	which is to say, gules+{sable, vert, azure}, sable + {gules,vert}.
	Gyronny from the edge of the field, and gyronny of more than eight
	shall obey the combination limit for divided fields.
	c. Partition Lines. In simple cases only, a party field tinctured
	either all dark or all light may use a complex line of partition.


(all typoes mine, I hope there aren't too many...)


	So there is no reason for the above combination of Per pall
metal, color, color, and I suspect that it (or a close cousin) is in
use somewhere in the SCA.  As for gyronny of 5 and 7 and 9...  other than
that it is easier to divide a field up into even numbered parts I don't
see why not...  (except that you'd probably contrast, at 7 and 9, with 
simular tinctures of 6, 8 and 10.)  Gyronny of five might even make
for a distinctive device...

The following comments are, to the best of my recollection, the current
rules on tinctures in the SCA.  Mundane heraldry may be different;
and I haven't got my Heralds Handbook in my office, so I can't double-
check my memories.

There are three classes of tincture, light (the metals "Or" and "argent"),
medium (the furs, such as "vair"), and dark (the colors "purpure", "sable", 
"gules", "vert", and "azure"). (** Please no flames about vert and purpure! **)
I believe that the mostly-light furs, such as "ermine" are counted as light,
and the mostly-dark ones, such as "counter-ermine" are counted as good
 -- oops -- I mean dark.  Charges blazoned as "proper" are assumed to
fall into one of these categories, i.e., an "oar proper" is dark, and
a "sword proper" is light.

Furs can be used anywhere any ticture can be, as long as the rules
of tincture are obeyed, i.e., no charge shall be placed on a charge or
field of the same class (dark on dark, etc.).  The exact policy has
a few loopholes, which I don't remember because the Western CoH
has unilateraly closed them.

Divided fields complicate matters.  For two-way divided fields, at least,
all color-combinations are permitted, but low-contrast divided fields
are discriminated against when it comes to counting points of difference:
the difference between "per pale vert and sable" and "per pale vert and
argent" is less than the difference between "per pale vert and argent" and 
and "per pale vert and or".  (I hope I got that right.)

Charges on divided fields need, at the least, good contrast on the
identifying features of the charge.  I won't say more 'til I have
the rules in front of me.

I hope you have found this helpful.

To show people that some of their beliefs of period vs. modern just aren't

before they criticized someones attempt at a costume...

Milord,
    Is it not possible for someone to have a different reason than the
rather... sordid... one that you have ascribed in advance to him or her?
Admittedly, I can't envision any other reason either, but I refuse to
assume that someone is trying to bait me - I prefer to have it proven to
me first. *smile*.

In this instance, isn't it as much a statement on the part of the other
gentle who would wish to argue with you?  It does require two people to
make an argument, although only one to make a pain in the rump.

There have been times that I have been subjected to the "That isn't
authentic" hue and cry, to which I merely reply to them (with a bow),
"Mi(lord/lady), I believe it is, and my research leads me to believe that
it is.  I'm sorry that you disagree with me."  And from that moment
refuse to argue.

Most SCA helms would not meet the visibliity requirements of a motorcycle

------------------------------

/* ---------- "Konichi-wa" ---------- */
this fine institution to attend to the needs of their machines. This 
employment has its advantages, among them this forum. I have been 
reading these proceedings for a few weeks while I have been learning the 
system here, and I am now confident that I am able to manipulate the 
editor in a satisfactory manner. To those persons among you which it is my 
pleasure to have met: Hello! And to those whom I have yet to meet in 
person: also, hello!
	       On to my thoughts:
1. To Cyrus Hammerhand.
     Since my only two available modes of transpotation are by hoof and 
motercycle, I frequently play in traffic on two wheels and in armor. In 
Wisconsin, helmets are required only for those riders under the age of 
18. I would never wear my fighting helm while riding for the following 
reasons; 1. Riding requires eye protection, and my helmet protects 
against only those missles smaller than 1", 2. Motorcycle helmets are 
made so that the rider can be tossed on his head without injury, SCA 
helms are fashioned so that a blow with a weapon causes no damage. The 
additional mass and protuberences of my helmet would make a crash more 
dangerous, and 3. I get enough weird looks from the local gendarmerie as 
it is in my armor without inviting additional inspection. However, I 
consider my armor even better body protection than my leathers. In 
closing on this subject >>>ALWAYS WEAR YOUR HELMET WHEN RIDING<<<. 
(Fighters should find this intuitively obvious.)
     2. Computer heraldry. 
     Many years ago, I designed a program for just such those purposes 
as have been described, but I gave up the project in frustration at the 
micros of that era. Now I think that they might just be powerful enough 
to handle this task. I'll put it in line with my other projects. I 
believe the design is still valid.
     3. Minors at Pennsic.       
     When I joined the SCA, I was a minor whose parents had no interest. 
I had more problems with being accepted as a person (by some, not many) 
than I ever did with official sanctions. I have been to many Pennsics, 
and I have seen minors both good and bad, accompanied and unaccompanied. 
My personal opinion is that some supervision is necessary, but only 
allowing minors present with their parents present may be a bit much.
     4. Baronial Stuff.
     In Jaravellir, we have a Baroness who has reigned for an 
exceedingly long time, and had somewhat lessened her participation in 
the Barony. Certain factions of the populace wanted a figurehead who 
would be more visible to the community. Several ballots and unofficial 
polls were taken, and the result was an election to determine who the
recommended lord wold be. As one of those nominated, I would say that 
the least friction in this case was among those on the ballot. Such was 
the chaos and outcry that when the recommendation was finally sent to 
the Crown, a 'Lieutenant Baron' was announced. This was not an 
acceptable action to those nominated, but was done because of the severe 
objections of some of the members of the Barony. The lord chosen had a 
hard time actually doing anything because he wasn't a *real* Baron, and 
there were those who felt that the appointment was arbitrary. I 
apologize now for any politicking which may come from my home; I am 
sorry that some people must suffer to hear my Barony's dirty laundry.
     5. In Closing.
     I am sorry this is so long, but it is my first article, and I had a 
lot of ground to cover. I look forward to continuing to enjoy your 
electronic company.
P.S. I didn't get your E-mail address Robyan, so just say HI to your

/* ---------- "Anuddah newbie!" ---------- */
Good-day gentlefolk,

After finding this newsgroup yesterday afternoon and spending much of
the ensuing 15 hours catching up on 500+ articles, I find myself being
much more interested in the SCA than I was when I started (which is to
say I wanted to become a member, now I MUST become a member.)  But
first, a few questions:

1.  I am currently living in Worcester, MA (it's the armpit between
Boston and Springfield) and will be here until next May, at least.
Where is the nearest Shire and what can I do to join?  Unfortunately,
I have no form of transportation other than a bicycle and a great
willingness to walk, if needs be.
   a.  Where can I get training in techniques of battle?  I do not own
any armor, or a practice sword (I do have a nice bastard sword), but I
would like to learn more about the blade.  In fact, I'd prefer not to
use armor at all, but safety considerations...
   b.  Where could I get several rattan swords?  I'm handling weaponry
and some weaponplay for a production of _Macbeth_ here at WPI next
November.  I have access to many daggers and swords, but nothing for
practice.

Well, that's it for the questions.  Now for some comments.  One of the
first things I noticed was duct tape.  I hadn't known it had that use.
It's used in theatre commonly under the term "gaffer's tape."  I've
seen it used to tape lights to bars, mark cables, hold costumes
together, and even hold people up, but never taping swords!

Now, for a general compliment: there were/are no flames!!!!
Thank-you, everyone, for being so open and friendly.

Hmmmmm, what else?  Oh, when is Pennsic?  After all those messages,
all I've found is that it's located somewhere in western Pennsylvania
and it occurs in the summer.  I'd really like to go, if things work out.

The whole authenticity thing is tied to beauracracy, I believe, which
ties in the Pennsic 'problems', naming, and just about everything the
SCA is.  A word of warning, from someone who handles paperwork:  keep
the beauracracy to a minimum.  As someone who definitely wants to
join, the membership w/out payment idea is nice, but not necessary.
But for those people who are trying out the SCA, it's really great.
To deny people entrance because they're not members causes a lot of
extra red tape for both the autocrats and the (possibly) new gentles.
The whole business with the names sounds somewhat like the problem
with radio censorship:  when does a submitted name go beyond the SCA
limits of validity?  (Radio stations have the problem with decency)
If the people in charge used a modicum of common sense, which SCAdites
seem to have aplenty, there wouldn't be much of a problem.  It's when
you try to follow the letter of the rules, rather than the spirit,
that things get difficult.

Just my deux centimes,

jon

So, I can't send directly to either of your suggested addresses.  I'll
try them on the Cc: line here, just in case, but I expect that I'll
shortly be forwarding you the bounce-o-grams.
 
Perhaps I could send something to
sca-request%mc.lcs.mit.edu@mintaka.lcs.mit.edu, but that poses
difficulties with the gateway software.  The gateway scripts are
processed thru several layers of awk, m4, and the like, and I'm unable
to persuade it to send something to
"sca%mc.lcs.mit.edu@mintaka.lcs.mit.edu" - passing the % has
completely baffled me thus far.
 
Might it be possible to persuade the postmaster at mintaka, since
they're already claiming to act as MX for mc, to create a mailbox
"sca" that they would then locally forward to sca@mc.lcs.mit.edu
(similarly with sca-request)?  The move that hid mc without any
externally-visible machine to handle their existing mail addresses has
really confused things out here in the rest of the world...

Sigh; just when I thought things had cleared up, I'm proven wrong again.
Please respond if you get this message; I'm manually routing through

I did get the back digests -- thanks. I also got a passel of them yesterday,
but things seem to have cut off again today. I'm rather confused. Are you
getting bounces, or are the messages just falling into a black hole? I'm
getting a lot of my Internet mail, but everything from mc is doing quite
badly (it's not just SCA; paganism and subgenius are having the same
problems).

Also, I'm not sure you know -- the Usenet -> mailing list gateway appears to
be down again. I'm seeing a lot of messages on alt.sca that look like responses

Subject: The Reason for no Minors at Pennsic

This shall be short, for the reasons that minors are not allowed at Pennsic
have been discussed many times.
Minors (under 18) are not allowed at Pennsic for MEDICAL reasons, not for
Behavioral reasons.  If you are under 18 and are injured, no matter where you
are in America, you can NOT be treated for ANYTHING until your legal
guardians/parents give the ok.  A note from your parents putting other adults
in charge does not make the other adults your guardians.
It`s not my idea, it`s the law of the land.

Subject: minors at Pennsic

Unto Saethydd O'Shrewsbury and the good gentles of the Rialto, Li Kung Lo
sends greetings! Milord, I feel that you (and many others) misunderstand the
proscription against minors at Pennsic unaccompanied by their parents or legal
guardians. First, this has been in effect since Pennsic XVII (last year).
Secondly, it is not the opinion of anyone within the SCA, or even necessarily
the opinions of the Coopers which make this necessary, but rather the opinion
of the Cooper's attorneys, based on requirements of mundane law. First of all,
a minor under Pennsylvania law is anyone under 18 years of age. There is a
special category called "emancipated" minor, who is treated as an adult by
law, and could attend Pennsic alone. The problem is largely that in
Pennsylvania (and many Eastern states) medical care *cannot* be given to a
minor without the express written (and specific) consent of his/her legal
parents or guardians. Many states have a provision for the appointment of a
temporary guardian, and it is simpler in some places than others. In some
states, a simple notarized letter would do, but in Pennsylvania this requires
a court proceeding and a fee of *several hundred dollars*! This means that
your Seneschal, etc. cannot generally do this thing. 
        If you (any unemancipated minor) shows up at Pennsic, chirurgeons
cannot treat you without risking their licenses and leaving themselves open to
lawsuits. Furthermore, a hospital emergency room cannot admit you or treat you
medically, except for basic life preservation. Such limited care may result in
your being maimed, disfigured, or disabled for life, and the Coopers would be
liable for all your losses for allowing you to be there in the first place.
The SCA is also potentially liable for the same reasons. 
        I'm sorry, but it doesn't matter whether you drink, raise hell, or
not. If that was a reason to deny entry to Pennsic, our overcrowding problems
would be solved, and I could camp on Tuchux hill! What does matter is that
while in Pennsylvania without your parents, you are basically a runaway, and
you cannot receive medical treatment because your parents might be Christian
Scientists, etc. I am truly sorry, but I only work here...

Good gentles, please forgive me if some of my comments and additions seem a 
little out of date with what's going on with the Rialto.  I'm not on alt.sca,
and receive the Digests in a "bundle".  I promise that nothing here will have
cobwebs on it, though.
 
Mustapha mentioned a book of period games.  It was written by the Baron Beyond
the Mountain, Salaamallah the Corpulent, and some other people, and I believe
you can get it from the SCA Stock Clerk or from Raymond's Quiet Press.  Also,
Salaamallah did a Compleat Anachronist issue on gaming a few years ago, and you
can order a reprint from the Stock Clerk (see TI for a list).
 
If anyone else besides Lindorm Eriksson is interested in runic typefaces for
the Mac, let me know.
 
How to feed a fighter (Nicolette?): I guess the first thing you have to decide
is whether you want to cook AT ALL, not even hot water.  There are a number of
good things you can create just by adding hot water, such as instant oatmeal,
soups, and backpackers' meals (the last aren't very good, but they're certainly
convenient).  Also, the best outdoor meal I had recently was two hot sausages
wrapped in a big hunk of French bread.  You could do the same with cold cooked
kielbasa, but frying two sausages doesn't take much.
 
Here's my shopping list for what to feed people who are too tired to cook:
 
Instant Gatorade (our favorite period drink!)
Bananas (not exactly common in the Middle Ages, but they have lots of minerals
to replace the ones you've just lost)
Fruit (grapes are always popular, but apples and oranges are good)
Cheese
Cold cooked chicken
Summer sausage or kielbasa, or cooked ham
Bread -- I prefer a nice wholegrain loaf 'cause they keep longer
Cookies -- things like Digbie cakes keep well and are easy to make ahead of time
 
To Barony or Not to Barony (Awilda): Ooh, you are in a spot, aren't you?  I've
seen two would-be Barons in my "extensive" SCA lifetime, and neither one ever
really did get what he wanted.  The first time, the shire fell completely
apart over the issue.  The second time, everyone in the shire united and said
"No, we'd rather be a Province"... and the person who wanted to be Baron never
did lend much energy to a Provincial effort after that.  Funny about that, huh?
 
Until Provincial awards are listed in the Order of Precedence, I can't see any
reason to go Province unless you want more bureaucracy.  You have to have the
same slate of officers as a Barony, but you don't really get all that much in
return.  (Anyone in Mountain Freehold or Myrkfaelinn have a better-informed
opinion than mine?  Please tell me what life is like in a Province.)   
 
The people who live (or have lived) in Baronies are better able to tell you
the advantages and disadvantages thereof; I never have.  I'm admittedly biased
against forming a Barony because of the two cases of tin-hat fever I've already
seen, but lots of places do it and survive.  (Kale, Steffan, or anyone else
who's been around long enough: What do you remember about when Patri was made
Baron of Carolingia?)
 
As for communicating with the Crown: remember our long and drawn-out debate
on letters of dis-recommendation?  I believe that your writing the Crown about
your misgivings falls under the same topic.
 
On the whole, it sounds as though you would be best off staying a shire until
you all can come to a consensus about what you really want.  Best of luck.

Subject: Becoming a Barony

I'll bet that the prospect of becoming a barony has destroyed more
thriving shires than anything else. (The remnants of my original shire
are lying around somewhere east of here...)

I have two comments on the problems of becoming a barony.

The first is that there is no rule saying that once a shire becomes a
particular size, it *has* to become a barony. If enough people in the group
feel that it won't survive the process, you can *stay a shire*. It is,
after all, a better option than bad feelings and a broken shire.
(The Shire of Seagirt (Victoria, B.C.) has long had the population
necessary to become a Barony but prefers not to go through the hassle of
choosing a Baron and Baroness. They are quite proud to be An Tir's oldest
shire.)

The other comment I have is that the Baron and Baroness are the
representatives of the crown and as such are (technically) chosen by the
crown to represent them in the barony. (Gosh darn! I've left my Corpora at
home. If I get the following wrong, someone correct me.) In practice,
a Baron/ess is chosen by the residents of the barony and presented to the
crown as a *candidate*.  The crown has the right to reject or accept the
candidate.  So if there's a stalemate in the choice of candidates,
why not present them *all* to the crown and agree to go with whoever the
crown chooses? (Just a thought.)

Subject: The Reason for no Minors at Pennsic

This shall be short, for the reasons that minors are not allowed at Pennsic
have been discussed many times.
Minors (under 18) are not allowed at Pennsic for MEDICAL reasons, not for
Behavioral reasons.  If you are under 18 and are injured, no matter where you
are in America, you can NOT be treated for ANYTHING until your legal
guardians/parents give the ok.  A note from your parents putting other adults
in charge does not make the other adults your guardians.
It`s not my idea, it`s the law of the land.

Subject: minors at Pennsic

Unto Saethydd O'Shrewsbury and the good gentles of the Rialto, Li Kung Lo
sends greetings! Milord, I feel that you (and many others) misunderstand the
proscription against minors at Pennsic unaccompanied by their parents or legal
guardians. First, this has been in effect since Pennsic XVII (last year).
Secondly, it is not the opinion of anyone within the SCA, or even necessarily
the opinions of the Coopers which make this necessary, but rather the opinion
of the Cooper's attorneys, based on requirements of mundane law. First of all,
a minor under Pennsylvania law is anyone under 18 years of age. There is a
special category called "emancipated" minor, who is treated as an adult by
law, and could attend Pennsic alone. The problem is largely that in
Pennsylvania (and many Eastern states) medical care *cannot* be given to a
minor without the express written (and specific) consent of his/her legal
parents or guardians. Many states have a provision for the appointment of a
temporary guardian, and it is simpler in some places than others. In some
states, a simple notarized letter would do, but in Pennsylvania this requires
a court proceeding and a fee of *several hundred dollars*! This means that
your Seneschal, etc. cannot generally do this thing. 
        If you (any unemancipated minor) shows up at Pennsic, chirurgeons
cannot treat you without risking their licenses and leaving themselves open to
lawsuits. Furthermore, a hospital emergency room cannot admit you or treat you
medically, except for basic life preservation. Such limited care may result in
your being maimed, disfigured, or disabled for life, and the Coopers would be

The SCA is also potentially liable for the same reasons.

This path ought to be working, but it's not clear that it is. It appears that
a black hole has grown up between mc and inmet; I'm getting a lot of my

try switching us over to "uunet!inmet!<whatever>" for the nonce?

Also, there may be some bounces in mid-June; inmet, currently a VAX 785, will
be switching to a Sun 4, and I expect some minor problems. If things bounce,
just try them again; problems should be pretty brief.

Finally, could you send the back issues since 341 to "uunet!inmet!justin"?
I need them for the Carolingian Archives...

Subject: Eating at Pennsic

Master Robyyan's comments about finding someone else to cook for you
remind me of my my favorite times at Pennsic, when I would round up
all the miscellaneous squires, etc, and promise to cook for everyone
in return for $1 per meal and help toting and fetching... I haven't
been able to do this in two years, what with pregnancy and whatnot,
but I hope to revive the Northmark Inn at some future time (but I
doubt I'll have Master Robyyan to kick around anymore, now that he's
married and gone away...)
 
At any rate, I work on cooking things that don't take a whole lot of
time but provide a lot of good nourishment. Breakfasts run the gamut
from sweetrolls to eggs and meat. Lots of OJ and other fruit juices.
I've become partial to oatmeal and cream of wheat, altho Robyyan
convinced me of the value of using the instant kind, and cleaning up
the pots from the long-cooking stuff reinforced that idea.
 
Lunches are usually available from 11 am to 3 pm, and consist of
some sort of roll and different varieties of lunch meats, cheeses,
fruits, etc. THis way the fighters and folks who are up and about
early can get their chow whenever they wan t, and the later risers
or brunchers can also get fed. Sandwiches mean I don't spend all day
over the stove, and can leave notes on what's available in case I
want to get out of camp for a bit. (My proudest moment over a lunch
came when a Western Duke of some repute "forgot" to eat breakfast
and got hit by the sun while over-doing it fighting, and I was able
to produce fruit and cheese and sandwiches for him while he
recuperated in the shade.)
 
DInners can be anything. With enough coolers and a grocery store
within 20 miles I can attempt anything, and usually do. I've done
chicken stir-fry in 3 different hot-nesses, massive pots of beef
stew, steaks, roast chicken, etc. The rules are: Start cooking about
4 pm, but don't expect people to be ready to eat before 8. (*this
works out really well, because everything takes longer to cook than
you'd expected, anyway.*) Make sure you have a lot of liquids on
hand -- not alchohol, but juices and lemonade and Coke and bottled
water. Remember that once the sun goes down it gets COLD, and these
folks will want a hot meal in the evening.
 
Try to get the dishes done before it gets dark.
 
Make someone else wash the dishes.
 
And, what bart and Robyyan will never believe, but which I've come
to believe myself very strongly in the last year: Make time to take
care of yourself. Make or let someone else cook at least one night
while you're there, and don't try to be perfect. Whatever you do
will be good enough.
 
   Regards,
       siobhan

Subject: An Tir Crown Results

Well, I've waited a seemly amount of time and it looks like no-one
else is going to tell you how our crown tourney went, so...

At the An Tir May Crown Tournament, held in the Barony of Lions Gate
(Vancouver, B.C.) on May 20-21, AS XXIV (1989), Sir Tjorkill Kanne won
the tourney for Companion Master Hlutwige Wolfkiller - defeating Duke
Sir Steingrim Stellari in the final round.

(Aside: Sir Tjorkill is male, Master Hlutwige is female.)

There were approximately 56 fighters in the lists.

All hail Their Highnesses, Tjorkill and Hlutwige!

 Re: No Minors at Pennsic(Without their parents.)

     Being a minor myself, I dislike this rule, or at least how I
may have inadvertantly mis-interpreted it.  I BELIEVE I noticed someone
say that it was Allready , or GOING to be put into practice that no
minors would be allowed at pennsic without their parent's accompaniment
...This Of Course depends on where you are living, and what you
consider a minor, being 17 I consider myself a minor.  If this is
true, I would not be allowed to attend pennsic.  Not that my parents
wouldn't enjoy a sweaty week miles from home surrounded by thousands
of people, who they would consider weird, It's just my parents AREN'T
members of the S.C.A., and have no interest in it what so ever!.
    I hope I've not totally mis-interpreted what ssomeone has said?
Though, personally, I won't actually be going for a year or two anyway
as I don't have the money/time.  I would assume that in a case like this
that a senechal, or other officer of the minor's Canton could act as a
temporary legal Gaurdian?  Would this not be more appropriate.  Though
of course, I can see both sides of the arguement, but I know it does not
apply in my case, as though I've brewed both Mead & Ale, I only drink
enough to taste how the batch has come out.  Personally, if I were
going to spend all the money to go down to pennsic, the time to go to it,
as well as suffering through the problems encountered in any mass
gathering of thousands of people, I would certainly not inebriate myself
to the point of intoxication, as it mean missing out on everything
happening around me.

        Personally, I find anyone who would do this, quite un-Adult.
Though, I can understand why some might want to do this, I think that
it would just ruin the reasons behind pennsic.  (Not to mention give the
S.C.A. a reputation of a bunch of milandering drunks!)


 *Sorry* my good gentles if i've inadvertantly offended any of thee
who make it a practice to get sloshed.

please do not dump failed mail messages in the todo file... just extract out 
"what" you want done.  It takes a while pawing through the whole digest to 
figure out whats to be "done" with that entry.

Do you use "sca todo" as a mail file? or as a regular file to be editted (which

Greetings good gentle, and welcome to the SCA mailing list.
    Please send all mail intended for the list to the address
	SCA@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU
whence it will be compiled into the daily unmoderated digest.  That is, all
the mail that arrives for SCA is automatically gathered into one large
message and sent out early each morning, without anyone checking it for
grammar, libel, or adherence to the list topic.  The digest conforms to a
standard format which many mail reading systems have tools to undigestify,
for your greater ease at reading.
    Please send all address changes, add/remove requests, complaints
about bad addresses, and similar administrivia to
	SCA-REQUEST@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU
which forwards to the list maintainers for our attention.  Please do -not-
send mail for the whole list to the -REQUEST address (we will probably
ignore it) or administrivia to the main list.  The SCA mailing list is
maintained by volunteers; please give us a chance to deal with your request
before complaining of neglect.
    Archives of old SCA mail are available on MC; we have also heard of
other sites which maintain their own archives of these messages.  The MC
archives are currently stored in rather large chunks, so if you want to
look through them, please ask the -REQUEST list for assistance.
    Users of Unix systems which participate in UUCP exchanges can receive
SCA mail by subscribing to the alt.sca newsgroup instead of the mailing
list.  The list and the newsgroup carry on a mutual exchange of SCA
messages, so joining either one should expose you to everything that comes
through to either -- though not necessarily in the same order.
    Since the SCA list is not moderated, we have to rely on the taste and
maturity of list members.  Please don't carry on personal diatribes or
wander too far from topics related to the Society for Creative Anachronism,
Inc.; however, you are welcome to disagree politely and to explore all
aspects of stuff related to the SCA.  Similarly, while brief advertisements
for large events (of the sort which might attract folks from other
kingdoms) and requests for information on places far away from you are
appropriate matter for the list, messages of a purely local nature are not.

    You may also be interested in being listed in the Rolls Ethereal, a
directory of SCA folk online.  We don't maintain the Rolls, but we do try
to coordinate with the maintainer, Lord Justin du Coeur.  To be listed
therein, please send your:
	SCA & modern name
	SCA & modern location (local group&kingdom, city&state/country)
	Titles & Offices if any
	SCA-related interests
	Online address
to JUSTIN@INMET.INMET.COM (from the Internet) or uunet!inmet!justin (from
UseNet).  Lord Justin wishes it known that the only fields required are a

please choose your best address and favorite titles, or he will be forced
to edit your entry.

    Some folk choose to announce their joining the SCA mailing list by
sending in a short persona description; others prefer to wait a while and
watch the discussion before commenting; some just read the mail and never

Message-Id: <1054@garcon.cso.uiuc.edu>

Ragnar Thorburgsson asks about things to do during an event for
non-fighters and non-archers.

When I look at fighting, I see 2 guys in armor hitting each other.
One guy hits the other's leg, he goes to his knees, the first guy hits
his own leg, HE goes to his knees, eveyone claps.  Eventually one guy
gets hit hard and falls down, and everyone claps again.  I'm sure that
I could get more out of it, but how?  Is it impossible for spectators
to get anything out of a fight?

I would like to listen to Lord Howard of Cosell. :-) Seriously, could
it be made workable?  I can go to the A&S competition and listen to an
artisan explain the art in front of us; I can go to an arms merchant
and ask about the pros and cons of various of the knives before us.
Could it be done for fighters?

I envision someone with a slightly elevated view, with 3-6 listeners
just in front of him.  He would give almost "sotto voce" comments,
ideally just loud enough for his listeners to hear, but not so loud
that others can hear (especially the fighters).  Quietness would be
critical.

There could be a few minor notes just before the fight, such as "Sir X
is famous for his polearm technique", "Lord Y has been doing well in
tourneys lately", "Z is squired to Duke W", "Here's a sword-and-shield
against a 2-handed sword.  It's important to get inside the 2-hander's
reach".  Only facts of a reasonably public nature -- nothing that
would give one fighter a major personal advantage if overheard: "Oh,
Lord A is fighting.  At the last Maidens, I used Moonwulf's Maneuver
on him and really cleaned his clocks".

There can be comments during the bout (if the fighters give
permission?).  The post-fight comments would perhaps be the most
valuable of all: "X dropped his shield for a moment, allowing the
fatal shot", "Y did well with Florentine -- he used mobility to get
his opponent".  These would be notes that would instruct me in what to
watch for in future fights, while the current one is fresh in my mind.

Could this be made workable?  Would anyone other than me be interested
in this?

Greetings!

About a week ago, someone asked why the nine of diamonds is known as
the Cruse of Scotland.  I couldn't find the original article, so I'm
posting this generally.  Sorry.

I came across the answer quite by accident yesterday in "The Highland
Clans" by Sir Iain Moncreiffe of the Ilk.  On 13 February 1692,
British government troops massacred the MacDonalds of Glencoe after
having spent the previous night billeted at their seat.  The attack
was arranged for political reasons by John Dalrymple, Master of Stair,
a minister of William of Orange.  Dalrymple's arms include a saltire
charged with nine lozenges (diamonds), hence the epithet.

Ain't heraldry wonderful!

B'Shem HaShem HaRachmon. Unto the gentles of the Rialto may this missive find
you in good health and spirits. MaAyt shel - Yonatan Moshe bereb Avram Yitzhak.

Let me make a very short clarification as to my concerns governing public
history. Hal Ravn is absolutely correct that ignorance of past problems and
their solutions is an excellent way to ensure their repetition. My concern
was that the answers to some (but not all problems) are better dealt with
privately on a need to know basis. This does not mean that individuals
should not ask, but that the answer should be through private mail. I
responded to the question by private mail twice and publicly once (as a
outside verifier for a short, accurate, recital of the facts by an unbiased
person). Frankly, the Michael B. situation had no answer or solution. The
only thing to be learned was that there are some individuals whose heads
and fantasies of power increase when they become monarchs, nothing new
ther History (past and contemporary) is filled by such unfortunates.
Identification of "problem" people (suggested in past digests) who are
likely to fight for a crown and having a friendly Duke (or other) to
take them out is only useful if they can be "identified" (whose criterion
by the way?) first. Michael was a "wild-card" that went from acceptable t
o very much less so. We coped as best we could (zero sum game). The only
benefit the discussion of this case produced was a removal of some
undeserved debris attached to one of the principal victims (yes, this is
worthy in and of itself, which is why I verified the account). In depth
discussion of Michael per se is less useful, and probably libelous.
I have lived in five Kingdoms since AS 5, and will be moving to my
sixth shortly. The most pressing issue (the one that underlies the most
real problems I have seen/experienced) is one of tolerance and empathy.
The healthy proliferation of the Society and its continuance through
the next ten years is directly tied to how well we (myself included)
manage to accomadate and accept widely differing viewpoints and modes
of expression. Authenticity police, blatant party animals, and the
problems surrounding Oaths of Fealty are all directly tied to these
issues.
Yes, lets mention the problems and get the answers, but let's also
separate the chaff from the wheat and get to the real issues. So, raise
the questions publicly if you can't get a good local answer but expect
that your best answers will probably come from private mail. If there
IS a lesson to be learned or a technique to be shared, by all means get
it into the Rialto (quick!!!!) -- but lets keep the unavoidable/untrainable
personality pishers to a minimum.

I have received several inquiries for more information, of a general sort, for
the Near East and after some thought have decided that posting it is the
best way to get it out. I have intentionally tried to keep english the
paramount language, although some french and arabic crept in. History,
law, calligraphy, architecture, arts and crafts, medicine, philosophy,
and theology are all well represented within the bibliography. All the
books should be within reach of University libraries and most community
ones. I hope that this offering will help anyone with an interest in things
Near Eastern.

Message-ID:  <8905220024.aa17158@mintaka.lcs.mit.edu>


Unto Ragnar Thorburgsson and the good people of the Rialto, does
Mustapha al-Muhaddith send his best wishes for Peace and May Allah
shine kindly on his upcomming event.

Congratulations on your project and may you have good fortune with it.
However, I feel you are falling into a trap, common of first time
events, and that is that every event must contain something for
everyone.  

An event which contains and tourney and archery and a feast afterwards
already contains much, and does not need to be packed with other
activities.  The tourney, with its requisite Heralds, Marshals,
Mistresses of the Lists, Water Bearers and Chiurgeons will already use
up a substantial portion of your resources.  Adding further to that
list archery and activities for other non-fighters would greatly
strain the resources of a large Barony, not to mention an incipient
Canton.  It is better to do a little bit well, than to strain to do
everything and have it come apart at the seams.

The tourney can be of some interest to the spectators, especially if
the Herald is good.  A good herald can not only set the mideval
atmosphere at the tourney (especially by loosing obviously modern
terms like "On Deck" from his vocabulary) but can make the tourney
much more interesting by explaining to the audience what is going on.
If you have a small tourney (as it seems you are likely to do) it can
be helped along by providing challenge forms at the list table and
having most bouts be challenges.  Figure out who your herald is now
and have him/her start practicing, and find someone to spell him.

Other things that will help make the tourney more interesting to the
spectators are:  1) providing them with a shady place to watch the
tourney from and 2) having somebody (preferable a fighter) in charge
of periodicly chasing the fighters standing around in armour in front
of the spectators either to their knees or to a designate arming area
(again preferably shady) somewher out of the line of sight.  Finally,
things like backgammon sets, commet balls (a ball with a tail added),
bocce sets and other medival games may be provided.  However, unless
you have the manpower, don't feel you must entertain them, they are
perfectly capable of entertaining themselves, they can gossip, sing
songs, embroider or tell stories as suits their fancies.  

A few other pieces of advice on other proposed activities, especially
those proposed by Ellisif Flakkingskvinne:

-Merchants:  Make sure you have somebody in charge, and that that
person talks to at least one merchant beforehand to get some idea of
the kinds of problems that merchants can potentially cause and how to
avoid them.  (Some site require delicate negotiations in order to
allow merchants).
-quest and arts compentitions:  these take too much manpower and
should be left for a different event.  
-gaming tournaments:  require lots of manpower.  Far better just to
have a non-fighter who knows several medival games and is willing to
teach to anyone who is willing to learn.  Somalah  (spelling) has put
out a book of period games, anyone out there have a reference?
-classes:  Unless you are at some kind of university or schola, very
few people will probably want to attend.  This again should probably
be at a specially dedicated event.  
-dancing:  I think of this as an evening activitiy.  Fighters are out
of armour during the evening, thus bringing the ratio back towards
even.  This also requires the presence of a resonable competent dance
master and several competent dancers to get things started.  If you
don't have them in the local populace, maybe that is something you can
import from the Barony.  
-entertainment:  I think that this is again best done in the evening
(although not during dinner unless by one performer of known quality
and brevity).  A bardic circle is best run in either a quiet corner of
the hall, or better yet in another room which is more intimate and has
good accoustics.  Have an expericence performer check out your hall,
it may be accousticly dead.  Holding a bardic circle in the evening,
or holding a semi-announce but informal bardic contest during the
afternoon, may attract singers and storytellers to your tourney, and
once there they will practice their arts without any prodding from
you.  Plays and ensemble performances also work, but Ellisif's
suggestion of making sure that people who do not wish to be
entertained have somewhere to escape to is excellent and should be
well heeded.  

One more piece of well meaning advice for first time Autocrats:
DELEGATE!  DELEGATE!  DELEGATE!  Make sure you have competent (or
trainable) people in charge of all of the major activities (including
set up and clean up and gate keeping), who are responible for finding
their own crews.   If all you do as autocrat is the budget, arranging
for the site and making sure that all your deputies know who each
other are and are talking to each other on a regular basis, then your
event will run smoothly without you help, and you will be availble for
damage control when they don't.  

May Allah, the Compasionate, the Merciful smile on your upcomming
event and all your ventures.

	--Mustapha al-Muhaddith
	  (Russell Almond)

P.S.  The series of sylables "feastocrat" is not a work but rather a
ludicrous contraction of two other words.  It should be burried in a
deep hole somewhere and replace with the more palitable "kitchen
autocrat" or the perfectly good period word for chief cook: "chef."

Subject: Regalia

Recently someone from Ealdormere posted a message regarding regalia for the
new principality. I offer a few points.
(1) Study the regalia used in the real world. There is a new color video
version of the film "A Queen is Crowned", a documentary on Queen Elizabeth
II's coronation. It's very good. It's available from Publisher's Central
Bureau, among other sources.
(2) Work your totems, heraldic badges, etc. into your coronation ceremony. If
your group's badge is a wolf, place a wolf's pelt on your new prince. If it's
a deer, put antlers on the guy. Work up a legend of the founding of your
people "from the shrouded mists of time" and work your totems into it
(remember the Capotiline Wolf of Rome? -- that sort of thing).
(3) The reason for all this is to set you apart from everybody else. We're
supposed to be twelve separate countries, people, let's remember that! Okay,
so we're all confederated, but to me here in the East, An Tir and Meridies are
supposed to be *different countries* with strange inhabitants practicing odd
customs I can't understand. It doesn't have to be Ireland vs. China, it can be
England vs. Portugal -- both part of Christendom (read: the Society) but still
quite different.
(4) Two excellent examples of how to do this are Calontir and Outlands.
Calontir has their "group-persona" act together very well, I think. Good
esprit-de-corps, lots of regalia, the badges and liveries are seen everywhere,
those wonderful coordinated uniform tabards -- excellent. Outlands did an
amazing job of "being a different country" at the Pennsic War courts last year
-- completely unique "schtick".
(5) Local branches can and should do this too. Carolingia emphasizes it's role
as a center of culture by presenting a rose to the queen at coronation "in
token of her patronage of the arts". Bridge has a holy relic: the True Shield
of Camelot (ask me later), which can be displayed on solemn occasions. Be
creative!

Subject: Re: Corpora

Recently, Ricky Connell (sorry, I missed the SCA name) wrote about choosing an
SCA name, and his perceived difficulties in doing so.
My lord, denying someone the opportunity to have a made-up name is not going
to
cause anyone any difficulty. You can't have the persona of a real-life person
in the SCA. What we mean by "made-up name" is a name that was just
spontaneously created by the SCA member instead of being constructed from
period elements. For example, even though there may not have been anyone
well-known who was named Steffan ap Cennydd, the name is constructed properly
for period Welsh. On the other hand, Snorgleflarth of Gazoo is a (rather
blatant example of) a made-up name. There is such a wide world out there,
spatially and temporally, that no one should have to make up a name from
gibberish.
Choosing a persona need not be difficult. You don't have to research your
character down to the point of deciding what he had for breakfast on Dec. 14,
1302. Just find a place and time you like, pick an appropriate name out of
that culture and you've done all you ever *have* to do. Anything beyond that
is gravy. Now, having done that minimum research will probably prompt one to
do more -- that, in fact, is the true "educational" aspect of the SCA -- but
it is not required. The point is that, with a real-world base ranging from 5th
century Picts to 16th-century Japanese, why would anyone want a name out of
Fantasy (their own or someone else's!).

Subject: How to keep people busy without really trying
Message-ID:  <8905220959.aa28711@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>


Assuming that you are a small group, you're not going to wan to do anything
wlaborate to keep people busy while the fighters bash each other. You just
won't have the man power.  Asking people from other areas to teach workshops is
excellent, they get to do all the work, all you have to do if track them down,
get them to agree, set a schedule, and find a place for them to do it.  

Gaming on an informal basis is also good.  But something that might also work
is to hold a "Gaming Medeivally" class.  Someone willing to explain some of the
period variations of chess-and who makes the people in the class play one of
the variations is good.

Another one I particularly enjoy are riddles and questions.  The easiest way to
do it is to type up a list of riddles or questions and pass them out.  you
don't have to do anything.  The questions or riddles should be so obscure, nobody
can answer them by themselves.  They have to go around *asking* for help.  In
this way they are obliged to talk to other people and find out a little about
them.  If you do this right, you can make the questions appropriate to the
skills of some of the people you know will be attending.  Questions ought to be
sort of medeival trivia, questions like, "What King and Queen went around
knocking the tops off castles towers as a way of demonstrating their power to
rebellious nobles?"  And "Who kidnapped Richard the Lionhearted and what was
his ransom?"

Riddling was a very popular sport throughout the Middles Ages.  Books of
riddles can be found in the library.  There are even scholarly studies of the
history of riddling so you can pick out period riddles.  Or you can make them
up.  Oldest riddles were in verse.  A few period riddles: "What has two
backbones and  thousand ribs?"  And, "What does every lady keep below her belt
that if she lose it, she cannot get it back?"  "What has one hundred nails and
four souls?"

I have thought of other ideas, such as kite making and flying contests, but I
don't know if it's period for European personas. I haven't done it, but I would
enjoy it, so I think it's worth a try.  Mask making, and other things creative
that you do during the day is nice too.  Think of games children play,  many of
these were oringinally played by adults in the Middles Ages.  Games like
"hoodman blind" and "duck, duck goose" are period.  Note that in the adult
versions of these games, chasing after members of the opposite sex and kissing
them is a popular variations. These games allow non-fighters to run around and
work up a sweat and expend some energy.  Kids can also be incorporated.  

Improvisation is another idea.  If the event has a theme, a prize can be
awarded to whoever does the most appropriate thing based on the theme.  This
could be writing poetry, doing a scroll, a dance, a story, or  anything. 

By the way, if someone could send me an explanation of how to play "Comets" or
"Firepots", I would greatly appreciate it.

The One, True, Sacred, Official, North Woods Version of the Origin of the Cry
of Hoo-bah

Some years ago the King of the Middle was sitting on his throne in the Barony
of the Norht Woods when some dancing girls were brought into court.  They
danced in the Eastern fashion in which the faces are veiled, but the bellies
are not.  The King and his gentlemen were quite appreciative,a nd the King was
moved to cry "Hubba, hubba!"  The Queen thereupon fixed him with and icy glare
and asked, "What did you say?"  The King, realizing that his life hung inthe
balance quickly covered himslef.  "Hoo-bah, hoo-bah! I said Hoo-bah!"  And his
gentlemen came to his rescue, also crying out "Hoo-bah,"  which has been the
Midrealm's way of cheering ever since.

The One True, Slightly Confused, Official North Woods Version of the Origin of
the Cry Pooh-bah, as told by an Eyewitness

Some years later it happened again in Northwoods.  For some uneplained reason,
some unkown gentles (But one of them was Athelhawk) decided to make a gift of a
brown bear to the Barony.  Since the emblem of Northwoods is a wolf devouring
the sun, and the emblem of the Middle is a dragon, no one knew quite why they
picked a bear, but they did, and it was duly brought before the populace, who
cheered, "Hoo-bah",  whereupon some gentles cried, "NO! Pooh-bah!"  And
someone else quipped "Pooh-bear!"  Duke Sir Merowald de Sylveaston was in those
days living in the North Woods, but soon after he traveled into the land that
became the Kingdom of Trimaris, where, being a silly person, he introduced the
cheers in their new form.

Subject: Coopers info (Pennsic discussers, please read); LONG
Message-Id: <611845612/kee@A.NL.CS.CMU.EDU>

Here's some mundane-type information about the Coopers and Pennsic in
general that several people have suggested I make available on the
Rialto.  I've been living in Debateable Lands for nearly 6 years, and
these are things that I've picked up mostly by hanging around and
making myself useful now and then, as well as by doing a bit of real
research into various topics (such as mundane attitudes toward
campgrounds in this area.)  Probably some part of this information has
appeared here in other guises, but I think a lot of it hasn't.  It's
going to sound a little disconnected because it's compiled from mail
conversations that I've had with various people, but I think that it is
nonetheless readable, and it's certainly timely.  My assumptions in
posting this are that we are mostly reasonable human beings; if
anything I say here appears to imply otherwise, please try to interpret
it as reasonably as you can.  The rumors seem to be getting out of
hand, and since the Rialto has been partly responsible for their
creation and fast propagation, it seems like a good idea to post some
hard information here.

Re: the "game" of who (Coopers vs. SCA) does what to accomodate Pennsic:
 
The game has always been a series of compromises.  The Coopers have
mundane obligations of which most Pennsic-goers seem unaware (see
the next paragraph down) and inconsistent expectations on the part 
of the autocrats from one year to the next have meant that the SCA has 
not been in the best position to put forth its own interests in a
consistent way.  For years the Coopers have requested a permanent Pennsic 
Committee to deal with as an SCA interface, and this is now being tried 
on a trial basis.  (Up till now, the political will within the Midrealm 
and the East to institute such a committee was lacking.  This year's 
autocrat has instituted it; it includes representatives from at least 
4 Kingdoms, the Coopers, the autocrat's staff & the Corporation.)
If this became a permanent thing, then we could actually have continuing
legal contracts with the Coopers from year to year, with improvements 
and other obligations spelled out, because there would be a stable SCA
authority to hold up our end of the bargain.  (This is something that 
many long-term mundane campers have, in the form of a lease or a deed.)
 
The Coopers are not just in the Pennsic business.  They are also in the
business of running a family-operated mundane campground.  As an
established presence in the area, they have obligations to their
regular campers, who have in recent years become increasingly
inconvenienced by the ever-earlier Pennsic arrivals.  Western
Pennsylvania is not a land of transients.  Even in Allegheny County,
where the big city (Pgh) is, over 70% of the residents were born there. 
Much of the Coopers' business is with long-term (entire-summer and hunting
season) campers who have been going there for years.  They live in a web
of mundane obligations which can in some ways be compared to the feudal
obligation structure in the SCA.  The War takes over their lives for a
good chunk of the year, and I can certainly understand why they feel a
need to draw some kind of limits to the extent to which the War can be
allowed to disrupt the actual mundane operation of their campground.
Yes, they are well-compensated for their time and I, like many, have
tried to figure out just HOW well.  But there are some things that
money can't buy, and peace with their mundane campers is one of those
things.
 
Thus, if SCA people want to come early and camp like the rest of the 
"paying public", that is fine with the Coopers.  Like the rest of the
"paying public", when it is time to clear the site for Pennsic, they
will have to clear the site.  I don't find this particularly unfair.
When one camps there mundanely, one has to wear clothes at the swimming
hole and camp in one of the regular numbered sites.  Sometimes early
Pennsic arrivals fuss a lot over this.  Making a clear demarcation
between when Cooper's is a mundane campsite and when Cooper's is the
Pennsic site will, I hope, cut down on the inevitable friction between
what the Pennsic campers expect and what the regular campers expect.
 
In connection with our being the Cooper's major source of income, that 
does not mean that we are their only obligation (as explained above), 
or that they would prefer to concentrate solely on Pennsic.  If they
absolutely HAD to choose, I'm not at all sure they'd choose us, but I
know they would prefer NOT to have to choose--they'd rather keep us, 
and keep us happy.  It makes good business sense, and they are honest 
people, though not immune to greed.  (Disclaimer:  I don't know any of
the Coopers personally; I observe their behavior and learn what I can
about the conditions under which they operate their campground.)
 
Re: physical limitations of the Coopers' site:
 
I recommend to you Awilda's excellent comments regarding land, wells
and septic systems.  With no municipal water or sewage available, the
sanitation options are more limited than most Pennsic campers will ever
realize.  Every year the call goes out for more bathouses and flush
toilets; every other year or so another one gets built, but due to
septic requirements they must be carefully spaced out.  Each such new
facility costs about $20,000 to build, even with labor provided largely
by the Coopers and their relatives.  The porta-potties that so many
people deplore are the only way, short of a sewage treatment plant,
that the campground can accomodate 6,000 people for days on end.
(Municipalities float bond issues to build sewage treatment
plants--this is not a realistic option, at least not using current
technology.)
 
Yes, they need to get more water buffalos this year, and yes, maybe they
could try to put in a new bathroom at the rate of one a year instead of
one every two years, but those must remain as far apart from each other
as the current ones are.  The drainage field has to be carefully
managed to meet state and local sanitation laws.  Also, to be able to
build at a faster rate they will have hire outside labor, which will
drive up costs enormously, and they can hardly be reasonably expected
to sink a huge amount of money into the speed factor to accomodate us
for two weeks out of the year--unless we help (presumably by putting
money into the building fund.)
 
[Cariadoc, if I have made any economically-unsound assumptions I am
counting on you to set me straight, y'hear? ;-]
 
I also think that there needs to be a larger covered space than that
afforded by the Barn, and this means either enlarging the Barn,
building a bigger one close by, or renting an enormous tent as was
done at the TYC.  I suspect the last option is the cheapest one in the
short term.  Then the fight over where THAT would be pitched would
probably end up being a battle royal, and nobody would be pleased with
it until it had been there long enough to be a "tradition" (about 2
Pennsics, by my reckoning. ;-)  Let me not borrow trouble by belaboring
this point at any more length.
 
Re: the building fund and the $5 fee:
 
Obviously a delicate topic, this was one of the features of the
compromise arrived at by the Pennsic Committee at its meeting 3 weeks
ago.  The Coopers did NOT request the $5 fee, or ask that it go into
the building fund.  The creation of the fee was the compromise arrived
at to discourage campers from grabbing more land than was justified by
the number of people in a group, and also to discourage land speculation
on a grand scale; both of these practices, while they can be considered
features of a free market, are generally agreed to be unfair (in this
context) by those who do not practice them, which constitutes a large 
majority of Pennsic campers.
 
The fee was argued for and against; putting it into the building fund
was argued for and against; the Committee, not the Coopers, made these
decisions and they made them because they saw a need to protect against
abuses.  These abuses in fact exist and are not hypothetical.  If you
would like to make reasoned arguments against the fee, please feel free
to do so, and feel free to send reasonable letters on this score to the
Pennsic Autocrat, whose address will appear (if it hasn't already) in
your Kingdom newsletter, or certainly can be had by asking on the
Rialto.  (I don't have my "Pikestaff" here at work, or I'd post it.)
 
The building fund does have uses which appear pretty legitimate to me,
some of which are mentioned in the last section of this post, and
others which can be inferred from what we all know to be the needs of
the Pennsic War.  This doesn't mean that the site fee is justified;
obviously there is more than one side to that question!
 
Re: space to camp, crowding of facilities: facts & suggestions
 
Camping space:  There has been more land available just about every
year for the past 5 or so.  The Coopers have leased their neighbor's
cornfield for parking and battle space, so as to move camping into the
space formerly used for those things.  This year, the Woods Battle has
been almost totally moved onto newly-purchased land farther up the
causeway, and partly into a chunk of Moraine State Park which borders
on the old battle area.  Much of the former Woods Battle area will be 
available for camping this year.  There will be a second swimming hole
downstream for people who prefer clothes, and there will be camping
allowed all through that area, as I understand it.  It looks to me
like, the more people who camp in the woods (and get all that lovely
shade), the less the need for ANYONE to have to camp next to the
parking lot, and get all that awful dust and noise!
 
[In this connection, I can't resist mentioning that the BMDL's own
Random Wronghand was the first to take seriously the notion that the
SCA might be able to fight in part of Moraine State Park's land, and he
was the first to contact the park rangers about this, which was about a
year ago.  His initial contacts met with great success, though a later
administrative mixup meant that we had to cancel a BMDL fighting practice
scheduled there last summer.  Since then negotiations have been taken
over by Pennsic staff, not by the BMDL, and evidently they also have
been successful.  I hope that all goes well for this new twist to an
old game!]
 
I agree that scouting out some kind of backup or alternate site would
be a good idea.  More to the point, in alleviating the current problems
of the current site, I think that Cher of Bellvue has an excellent
idea in encouraging people to consider camping or motels close by and
making a short commute to Pennsic.  That would take some of the load
off the site, especially in terms of camping space and showers, which
are two of the sorest points there are.  This certainly wouldn't do
for everyone, but I'm sure there are those out there who would find
that they actually prefer it (I know some of them who already do!)
 
Re: The SCA (or some private group of SCA friends) buying its own site:
 
Awilda's comments about the problems of the SCA developing its own site
are certainly on target.  Yet, I think that perhaps Eastern Ohio would
be a good place to look for land, despite the inherent difficulties of
the SCA's doing Pennsic on its own.  Land is cheaper there, and of much
the same character as it is in the area of Cooper's Lake.  It's in the
same general central region between the Middle and the East.  Ohio's
mundane laws are generally less restrictive than Pennsylvania's.  It would
take YEARS to bring this off, but if the SCA continues to grow at the
current rate I think it will eventually become feasible--with some good
legal and business minds at the helm.
 
That doesn't mean that Pennsylvania, Western New York or the extreme
northern part of West Virginia wouldn't also be good places to look for
land.  I didn't say that and I don't mean to imply it.  Since at the 
current time any holding forth on this topic is of necessity highly
hypothetical, I won't waste anyone's time doing more of it.
 
-------
 
This ends my comments.  If anyone would like to send me mail about
this, I can't promise to answer it, though come NEXT WEEK I would
probably try to.  Basically the best of what I have to say is outlined
above, and I don't consider myself obliged to defend against every fuss
and flame.  However, I do want to encourage people to bring a positive
attitude to this discussion, because once the ball gets rolling it's
the positive viewpoints that make real progress happen.  It sure looks
to me like the ball is rotating at relativistic speeds already. ;-)
 
I thank everyone who has read this far for their patience!
 
This has come to you more from my mundane persona than my SCA one, and
thus I will sign myself mundanely,

Subject: Unarmoured Training

Good Day Gentles
  I am sligtly disturbed  at what I see  as an "Acceptable" method of training
while unarmoured!   Should anyone get  the opportunity to see  His Grace, Duke
Syr  Laurelen  Darksbane, or  His  Excellency,  Earl ( Iarl ? )  Syr  Emrys of 
Gwyntarian (perhaps at Pennsic), ask them to recount the tale of Emrys's early 
training  in single sword  and the resulting  trip to the *HOSPITAL*.   It was 
in about A.S. 18.   The details basically were that a very small piece of duct
tape that was sticking  off of the  end of his blade  swept across  Laurelen's
eyelid causing a "paper cut" that required micro-surgery and the use of an eye 
patch for about a month.  They were working **VERY** slowly at the time but it
doesn't take much!   This occurred between two seasoned veterans,  not rookies
and was just a freak occurrence.  But, then again, how difficult would it have
been for the helmets to be put on to avoid the whole situation?   The moral of
my tale is a simple one... *** DON'T SWING ANYTHING AT  ANYONE NOT WEARING THE
PROPER  PROTECTIVE GEAR !!! ***    If you want to  practice unarmoured,  fine, 
practice unarmed as well; NO PROBLEM.

  P.S.  That was  probably the fastest  turnaround time  I have ever witnessed
from a hospital emergency room! 
      Accident Occurs ... 
      Go to Hospital ... 
      Get Treated ... 
      Make Arrangements for Surgery ... 
      Return to Fight Practice Site   
      Elapsed Time = 45 Minutes!
  After all, how often do two stapping  young fellows dressed from head to toe
in twelfth century  Knight's garb wander  into the average  hospital emergency 
room responding to the the nurses questions...
      Nurse:    "What Happened?"    
      Laurelen: "I got hit with a sword."
      Nurse:    "a WHAT? "
      Laurelen & Emrys: "a sword."
      Nurse:    "Who hit you?"
      Emrys:    "I did"
      Nurse:    "O.K. the Doctor will be RIGHT WITH YOU!!!!!"
  Yet another tale  that is much funnier  many years later than it was on that

Subject: Pennsic Land Appropriation

  Greetings good gentles!
  As time for Pennsic approaches snd many missives have been passing by on the
subject of appropriating land it  has occurred to me that a slightly different
viewpoint might be in order here.
  I ask if, perhaps, The War HAS outgrown the SCA?   I say this because I have
seen most of the lands that  Their Excellencies,  Baron & Baronnes Cooper hold
sway over and they are  *TRULY VAST*.   To give you an idea,  the area that we
use ( From the top of the  "Hill North of the Main Battle Field" to the "Woods
Road  Along  the  Lake" )  is only  about 25%  of  their  lands.   There  is a 
*considerable*  amount of  unused space  north of  the "Hill North of the Main 
Battle Field". If you ever find anyone who has been on "The Hayride from HELL"
(Look in the  BM Debatable Lands,  or the Barony of the Cleftlands),  they can 
possibly tell you what it's like.   So in answer to the question of  "Has  The
War outgrown  Cooper's Lake Campground?"...  the answer is a resounding  "NO".
  So, what is the problem?  Think about how enjoyable it would be to hike back
to camp from the Woods Battle to, say,  another half a  mile beyond the  "Hill 
North of the Main Battle Field".   I'd be willing  to bet this wouldn't excite
many people.   I know  I had a hard time getting back to my camp at the corner
of  Howard's Fenway  and the  Great Eastern Highway  after the Woods Battle of
P. W. 11 where the temperatures soared to over 100 degrees Farenheit!  That is 
just the  beginning  of the  trip  I described  above!!!   The  "hay wagon bus 
service" has been a great  help in moving things about since those days but it
can't be relied upon to be everyone's personal pack-horse.  These are problems
that would be present no matter where the war was held.
  We've come  a long way from  the forced march from  Scotland to  Hastings to 
join each  other in battle  but it won't  be much different  as more and  more 
people join us at The War.  
  As far   as determining  who gets  what land,  I am  in  agreement  with the 
original postings staements...

Subject: Persona
Message-ID:  <8905221856.aa25435@mintaka.lcs.mit.edu>

Kale says hi.

I think people are meaning different things when they use phrases like
"doing persona" or "being in persona", and sometimes this can lead to
e-arguments that are confusing as well as confused.

At one end of the spectrum, "in persona" means anything to do with
the SCA-as-medieval-society (as opposed to SCA-as-*medievalist*-
society).  When we're in medieval garb, using our medieval names,
in the group that's ruled by kings not administered by branch
officers--the things we're doing are done "in persona".  When some
people on the Rialto talk about banishment as being a punishment
"in persona", they mean a punishment inflicted *within* the medieval
game, not something done to the mundane person (which expulsion from
the club would be).  Hilary of Serendip may not "do persona" in any
of the further senses of this article, put I assume she respects the
Crown as more than a funny hat, and I myself have seen her wear garb.

Further along, "having a persona" means picking a time and place within
the SCA's boundaries (or "just visiting"), and taking your name, your
garb, your accessories from that culture.  Some people don't do this at
all, others are kind of fuzzy about it ("from the North", instead of
"Brittany, 1485"), and most of us bend things a bit: we all know Vikings
who own at least one Cavalier outfit, or Tudors who dress barbarian for
the war.  This is the degree to which I myself "do persona".

Next (though of course these are not separate pigeonholes, put general-
izations along a spectrum) is persona as described in Cariadoc's Miscel-
lany: immersion (only as intensive as the individual cares for) into
the life that a medieval person of your chosen locale, time, class,
age group, etc., would have *lived*, the little things like: do you use
money? what kind? how do you tell time? what is your lord's title? and his
lord's? who makes your clothes? how much washing is healthy for you?  I
consider this level, persona as a field of study, to be the sort of thing
that sets the SCA above a costume party; I regard it as an ideal level,
though I admit I fall short.

At the far extreme are those who compile a 14-volume autobiography of
their persona, heavily footnoted with one volume of bibliography.  This
is, of course, ridiculous. :-) But there are those...

There's lots of room here for different amounts of interest.  But I think
you have to fall *somewhere* on this spectrum to claim you're playing our
game at all, and I've let you know whereabouts I fall.  Anyone care to
refute? flame? expand?

Appendix:  Around the middle ranges of the spectrum I set up, there creeps
in the idea of "talking forsoothly" as part of "being in persona".  You
know, saying "farspeaker rune" to sound more medieval than "telephone
number", or "dragon" for its atmosphere even though "wagon" (or even "car"!)
would be perfectly good period English.  I suppose conciously modifying
your speech shows you're putting some effort into the act, but I think it's
counter-productive: I'd rather say "wagon", and pretend there are horses,
than say "dragon", and treat my friends as if they got here in the belly
of a fire-breathing reptile.  This, I'm prepared to get flak on.

Subject: Names
Message-ID:  <8905221913.aa25039@mintaka.lcs.mit.edu>

Kale says hi.

If a name is documentably period, and it sounds period, fine, no problem.
Similarly, if it *sounds* out of period, and it *is* out of period, only
the bearer and her/his close friends will object to the flushing sound.
But in between are problem areas.

Names that are period, can be documented, but *sound* wrong.  This includes
the "Bubba Goodgodson" (or whatever it was) cited recently on the Rialto,
or good ol' Tonkatoy (are you still out there?): I believe these can be
banned as bad theatre, if not outright rules hacking.  But what about names
that are forbidden by our rules for reasons other than outrageously mundane
sound, but are perfectly valid given period naming practices?  For example,
Thor Odinsson is illegal, unless you can throw thunderbolts etc.; but what
about Thor with some other surname - there are sufficient period examples,
but I have been given to understand you just can't take the name of a
divine being.  But see my own case, below.

Then what about names that are undocumented, but have "period ambiance"?
(the issue on the table, er, Rialto)  The problem here is, who decides
what sounds good?  Suppose someone decides they want a name that "sounds
Norse", but not finding one she likes in the literature, she decides that
Njala is "obviously" the feminine form of Njal.  Well, it isn't; it's the
dative (I think - I started this example without my Gordon's - silly of me
- well, the argument is still valid so I'll press on), and the diminutive,
and (hence) the nickname for the saga, but it's not a woman's name.  But
I'm just an expert (maybe) on the language - if Njala's whole barony thinks
it sounds fine on her and contributes to the period ambiance, am I just
an old fart picking nits? (mixed metaphor there, sorry)  Who decides?  And
under the circumstances, is it inherently evil to ask for documentation?
But again, see my case, below.

This also brings up the question of using 20th century fantasy literature
to document medieval-sounding names.  I have some philosophical problems
with the practice, and a few very specific disagreements.  But maybe I'll
save them for another time - this is getting too long already.

So, a case study: how I got my name.  (with thanks to Kwellend-Njal and
Cariadoc for giving me a context)  I decided on an early-period Scandinavian
persona; then I figured that I wanted a name that echoed my mundane name (at
least visually).  I found the name "Kali" in Orkneyinga Saga (twice, actually)
and chose that.  But halfway round the world from the Orkneys, Kali is a
Vedic death goddess (with lots of other connotations, some benign, I know);
she even appears as a major character in Roger Zelazny's _Lord of Light_
(excellent book).  I just *knew* that no one would have ever heard of
Jarl Rognvald Kali, but *everyone* would assume that I was naming myself
after what's-her-name.  So I chickened out, and adopted a variant spelling,
modelled on the Swedish nickname Kalle (nickname for Karl) but totally
unjustified linguistically.  The name was eventually approved by Laurel
(I had long problems with a device, and back then they were approved or 
not as an inseparable team), but with a request for documentation.  I
never gave any.  

So, was I overly cautious?  Arval: if I were to submit the name 
Kali to the College, complete with documentation from Orkneyinga 
(two different individuals, mind - it's not unique), proof of 
masculine gender, and making no claims to immortality, would pass?  
Anyone else: if you saw the name Kali would you just assume the 
bearer is taking a Vedic goddess' name, and if so how hard a time 
would you have given me?  (Not that I'm going to change it now -
it's on too many scrolls - but so's I know what the rules *are* 
before I claim to have broken them.  I can live with the fact
that our friends in Nordmark think of Donald Duck every
time they see my name.)

'Nuff said.  Hoping for feedback.

Subject: There We Were

First, to clarify: yes, David, this is the book you saw. By the second section,
Cooper's Lake (and, indeed, much of Butler County) has been purchased by the
SCA and made into "Pennsicland", a Disney-style theme park except for August,
when the mundanes get chased out so we can have the War. In general, it is
a direct mathematical extrapolation of where we're going. It is both funny
and a little scary, because so far, it's been quite accurate. There are three
parts to the story. The first is an issue of the Predawn Leftist (Yosef's
homebrew newspaper), describing the 34th Pennsic War (about six pages); the
second is a book called "There We Were", which describes the 45th War (about
30 pages); the last volume is "There We Were -- the Conclusion" (or something
like that), and is an SF story about the 260-somethingth War (also about 30
pages).

I have spoken with Yosef about it, and he doesn't mind if someone types it
in for the Rialto community. However, I'd like to suggest some ground rules
(assuming someone decides to undertake this project). First, don't send it
off as a lump to the Rialto. Either a) make it available through mail and/or
FTP or b) send it *gradually* to the Rialto (one chapter a week probably
wouldn't increase our volume very much). Second, please please *please*
remember to give credit (or blame) where it is due, and include an 
acknowledgement in each piece...

Finally, about the speculation that a Kingdom of the Lakes would interfere
with Pennsic -- not according to Yosef. By the 45th Pennsic, the East and
the Midrealm are fighting on the same side anyway...

Message-ID:  <8905221750.aa12834@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>


Early this year Dame Enid posed tot he Rialto a question she had a about how to
handle a certain problem in  her group.  I am afraid I am about to encounter a
similiar problem and would appreciate other people's advice.

Our shire has been large and successfull.  A Certain Lord  has suggested that
we ought to ask for an upgrade in status to barony.  Most people think an
upgrade is a good idea.  here's the sticker:  There is no general concensus
about who should be baron/ess.  The Certain Lord has given many years of
service and feels he should be baron.  A Certain Lady has given many years of
service and has her adherents.  Others find that these two canidates have flaws
they can accept in an officer, by not in a permanent ceremonial figurehead, and
support Somebody Else, but Somebody Else is not technically a member of the
group, even though he has given long hard service.  (His mailing address is
elsewhere).  Some others want a barony but have No Preference for baron.  Some
want a province, and thereby avoid the whole sticky mess of who's going to get
to be Baron Bigshot. 

It has been suggested that Certain Lord and Certain Lady should be Baron and
Baroness together, though they each have significant others.  I have serious
misgivings about both canidates.  In particular, I think Certain Lord has a
severe case of "I want to be a Baron.  I deserve to be a Baron, therefore we're
going to be going to be a Barony."  Certain Lady I don't know as well, but I
have the feeling that she likes Being Important.  In other words, I'm afraid
that the two front runners for ceremonial figurehead would get bad cases of
"brass hat disease". I've been around too many cases of the disease to want to
want to be around it again.  In case you can't guess, I favor becoming a
province.

Some questions about province status have been raised.  It is my understanding
that a province is exactly like a barony except it has no figurehead.  I
understand that it is customary for provinces not to hand out local awards, but
that this is not a legally distinction.  Certain Lord assures me that while it
may be legally possible for provinces to hand out awards, It Just Isn't Done. Certain
Lord also insists that being a barony is far more prestigious than being a province.  
What do other people feel about provinces?  Are there some unwritten rules
about provinces of which I am unaware? What do people living in provinces think
of them?

I am concerned about my shire and what happens to it.  I am sure a point will
come in which people of the shire shall communicate to the Crown about this
matter.  Shall I write to explain why I do not want Certain Lord and Certain
Lady as my baron/ess?  Or should I just shut up about the matter, not rock the
boat, and stay on good terms with everybody?  My gut tells me that I should
speak my mind, my conscience tells me that I have no right to promote
factionalism within the group. 

I would appreciate any input on this matter so that I can  deal with it before
the battle lines are drawn, and hopefully, prevent battles from occuring at
all.

To Ragnar Thorburgsson,

I attended a Twelfth Night celebration in Septemtria one year that had a
number of activities for everyone, including the fighters.  Most
particularly, I remember a tug-of-war tournament.  This worked well for the
fighter-types since it was very physical and required muscle and they had a
great time showing off.  (The winning team probably weighed as much as the
rest of the hall combined -- they were quite impressive).

A quest or, rather, a scavenger hunt that we used at Sergeant's and
Yeoman's this year for the children consisted of a collection of cards
(business card sized) with things written on them, like A Seneschal, A
Knight, a member of Barony X, etc.  The children wrote their names on the
back of the cards, then had to find a person matching the description.  At
the end of the day, the cards were collected and the person with the most
correctly identified won.

For Lady Ellisif,

A Stumper!  Most camping events that I attend serve a feast in the evenings
(Myrkfaelinn, Thescorre's Pax, War of Roses in Concordia).  I have had good
experiences and bad experiences. 

(I don't eat the feast at War of Roses because after three years of paying
for a feast that was always served late and with raw meat, I gave up.
However, both Thescorre and Myrkfaelinn serve wonderful outdoor feasts.  I
do also remember a camping event in Canada that served a horrendous feast
and, when asked how we liked it and we told them our opinion, was told "
well, what do you expect for an outdoor feast?".   We went back to our camp
and made grilled cheese sandwiches for anyone who wanted them.)

Two observations on feasts at camping events:
1)  It means you don't have to plan a meal and provide all the fixings; you
get to sit and socialize with others in a central spot; there is
opportunity for entertainment; it's a challenge for the cooks to cook with
what is available (Pax uses wood and charcoal firepits and coleman stoves
in combination, plus a lot of pre-event cooking, and they've served three
meals on site).

2) It means you don't get to practice cooking dinner at a camping event
until Pennsic; you can't guarantee quality of the food (although if a group
does a good indoor feast, they will usually do a good outdoor feast); it
means one more added burden to the autocrat.

A suggestion might be to discuss it with your cooks and see what happens
(this also depends upon facilities -- Myrkfaelinn has a kitchen they use,
Pax doesn't).  You could do a limited feast for Royalty and guests, you
could set a limit if your cooks feel 250 for an outdoor feast is
unreasonable, you could leave it at bring your own.  Given the event (and I
think I know what event you are planning for), there probably will be
little difference in attendance based on your decision.  At Pax usually
about 2/3 of the people attending eat on-board.  You might want to consider
planning to cook for certain people who *must* attend the event from a
great distance and who would appreciate being *catered to* for a weekend
(Royalty, Kingdom Officers, etc.).

Good luck with your plans!

  If you are not into opening cans and heating their contents as a way
to get hot food at an SCA camping event, you can try this trick (apologies
to whomever I picked it up from; I can't remember who you are):
  Cook a stew or soup at home ahead of time and freeze it in convenient
quantities.  Use your frozen food as the ice for your cooler for the first
couple of days.  When the frozen food gets near thawed, buy more ice and
heat up the frozen food.
  This technique supplied me and 2-3 others with dinner for a couple of
days at Pennsic 5-6 years ago.

Subject: Laurel apprenticeship

Gentles:

A possibly late comment on the recent discussion on Laurel apprentices/
associates/squires (fill in your own term).  I have been apprenticed to a 
Laurel for close to two years.  I did not enter this relationship with the 
hopes or intentions of ever becoming a Master of the Laurel myself, rather to
try to become the best dancer I possibly could.  Under my liege's guidence, I 
beleive my skill has improved.  By taking me as an apprentice, the Laurel 
provided me with a concrete example of skill to strive for.  Further, the 
nature of the apprentice/master relationship often goes further than the 
art or science in question.  Much of the Society's greatness is from the
tradition of honorable service, both to groups and to individuals.  This is one
way which I choose to live in the Society.

Message-ID:  <8905261408.aa11169@mintaka.lcs.mit.edu>


On the vexing question of barony vs province; Lady Orianna puts quite
neatly the difference in the question of baronial status vs the
baron/ess individual.  Having lived both in a province that went
sour (and eventually folded) as well as a Barony that flourished
and survived transitions from one set of hats to another -- and
knowing of others who also survived, IMHO bad politics between
persons is not limited to brass-hatism (pun intended 8-}).  Baron/esses
_have_ _no_ _power_, except to poison an atmosphere, it takes the
seneshal to really mess up a group into dissolution.  At least that
was what ended up factionalizing the former province.  It should
be possible to allow that delightful english statement [Her Majesties
_Loyal_ Opposition] in a Barony.  If the person(s) selected cannot
produce people willing to say that they are their Baron/ess'
loyal (!) opposition in that the populace has people who may oppose
this or that thing the civil service attempts, then the selected individual
should not wear said brass hat.  Should the above situation arise,
then the truly loyal Baron/ess (loyal to the populace) will gently
step down.

Subject: thinning the crowd

This is a suggestion in response to Orianna's posting "Thank you
Marion"  Those of us who are dedicated to the society, or some aspect of it 
tend to send tribute to California each year.  Our little yellow cards
do seem to indicate a certian level of interest in the SCA.  For 
the not so large sum of $6 per year, couln't a MEMBERSHIP in the society
be a factor in controling the numbers of those not interested in 
any part of the SCA, except for the parties at Pennsic?  I realize that
I may be disturbing a hornets nest, but I know of no other society
or association that does not require or suggest membership in 
exchange for privileges and/or benefits.  Of course, a tightly 
enforced bureaucracy wouldn't do. (So, if your membership lapsed in May
and you haven't got your new card yet, you could still attend Pennsic.)
If a person can afford a weeks worth of camping fees and related
expenses, he or she could certianly afford Associate Membership.
Planning ahead can not be too difficult, most people do have to schedule
vacations from work, etc.  For that rare new person who gets involved in 
the early summer and really wants to go to the war, perhaps correspondence
with the autocrat, or other designated person, would be allowed. Or a
letter of introduction from a baron, etc. or senechale.  Or maybe 
new people might have to wait til next year.  This last point 
will be a problem until policy is set-I don't pretend to have 
the issue sewn up into a nice, neat package.  The worse that can
happen is that no net effect will be felt at Pennsic-everyone
will become members, and the "problems" will still exist.  But
the Society as whole will benefit from the revenus and expanded
official membership base.

   You're confused.
 
Apparently so!
 
OK, we're back to using (and expecting) plain old sca@mc.lcs.mit.edu
and sca-request@mc.lcs.mit.edu again.  There was apparently a brain
fade on my end of the wire, and I didn't test vrfy for the complete
address, only for the short alias.  Indeed, when I tried to vrfy
sca@mc.lcs.mit.edu I got happy noises back.
 
So, we're back to completely trusting your MX records, and no more
hacks with %-ified source routing.  The gateway is once again back the
way it was before Dana Groff warned me that we might see problems from
mc's move.
 
Sigh...  All this for some rather odd people parading about in orange
tights and tin cans on hot summer days :-)
 
   If your mailer -doesn't- understand MX records, -and- you can't use
   the SCA-REQUEST%MC@MINTAKA.LCS.MIT.EDU syntax, then, well, we
   sympathize, but we can't help you right at the moment.
 
Exactly the attitude I would have taken.  Yes, we do MX, and we
similarly see no reason to coddle those who don't...

SIgh I doubt that would help.
Let me explain, Our system runs on a billing system where we are allotted a
certin amount of funds to use each week with the account being rebalanced on a
weekly basis. Recently there have been some billing errors with my account
locking me out of my system. I have about 1 meg. of memory allocated me and a
special unlimited area I can move things too. I have a program that scans each
night around midnight and moves most of my mail files to that area. The problem
is that it only moves things from specified recipients (so that if I get
something unexpected it is immediatly apparent) Since you have been changing the
name you are sending from (from internet to bitnet to internet) more frequently
than I have been able to get on to change the program it creates a build up.
 
   It is of course up to you to decide what you are going to do, It is
impossible to guarantee from ANYONE that they will NEVER bounce mail and even
less likely with this system and its management. I would like to point out in my
defense that I have been on you digest for over a year and the problems have
only come up recently. I really don't give a damn I am rather busy with
academics at the moment, the digest is a pleasent distraction but I can live with
out it and was in any event going to have to ask to be removed for the summer in
a month or so.
I do apologize for messing up the list.

dana got an idea,
I can move my entire mail directory over into an area where I have (in 
theory) unlimited disk space. The only problem being that area is rather
volatile in that it is the first to get wiped in disk crunches and there
is a daemon that deletes things that are not updated at least once a week.
will that do ?

Personal accounts are no longer allowed on my current machine, so I would be
very pleased if you could change my address FROM kean@mist.cs.orst.edu (could be kean@cs.orst.edu) to shatter!magnus@cs.orst.edu.
 
Thanks!

Greetings Good gentle, and welcome to the SCA mailing list.
    Please send all mail intended for the list to the address
	SCA@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU
whence it will be compiled into the daily unmoderated digest.  That is, all
the mail that arrives for SCA is automatically gathered into one large
message and sent out early each morning, without anyone checking it for
grammar, libel, or adherence to the list topic.  The digest conforms to a
standard format which many mail reading systems have tools to undigestify,
for your greater ease at reading.
    Please send all address changes, add/remove requests, complaints
about bad addresses, and similar administrivia to
	SCA-REQUEST@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU
which forwards to the list maintainers for our attention.  Please do -not-
send mail for the whole list to the -REQUEST address (we will probably
ignore it) or administrivia to the main list.  The SCA mailing list is
maintained by volunteers; please give us a chance to deal with your request
before complaining of neglect.
    Archives of old SCA mail are available on MC; we have also heard of
other sites which maintain their own archives of these messages.  The MC
archives are currently stored in rather large chunks, so if you want to
look through them, please ask the -REQUEST list for assistance.
    Users of Unix systems which participate in UUCP exchanges can receive
SCA mail by subscribing to the alt.sca newsgroup instead of the mailing
list.  The list and the newsgroup carry on a mutual exchange of SCA
messages, so joining either one should expose you to everything that comes
through to either -- though not necessarily in the same order.
    Since the SCA list is not moderated, we have to rely on the taste and
maturity of list members.  Please don't carry on personal diatribes or
wander too far from topics related to the Society for Creative Anachronism,
Inc.; however, you are welcome to disagree politely and to explore all
aspects of stuff related to the SCA.  Similarly, while brief advertisements
for large events (of the sort which might attract folks from other
kingdoms) and requests for information on places far away from you are
appropriate matter for the list, messages of a purely local nature are not.
 
    You may also be interested in being listed in the Rolls Ethereal, a
directory of SCA folk online.  We don't maintain the Rolls, but we do try
to coordinate with the maintainer, Lord Justin du Coeur.  To be listed
therein, please send your:
	SCA & modern name
	SCA & modern location (local group&kingdom, city&state/country)
	Titles & Offices if any
	SCA-related interests
	Online address
to JUSTIN@INMET.INMET.COM (from the Internet) or uunet!inmet!justin (from
UseNet).  Lord Justin wishes it known that the only fields required are a
name and a net address; also, he can only include one line per field, so
please choose your best address and favorite titles, or he will be forced
to edit your entry.
 
    Some folk choose to announce their joining the SCA mailing list by
sending in a short persona description; others prefer to wait a while and
watch the discussion before commenting; some just read the mail and never
send in comments at all.  How you interact with the list is up to you.
 
				To further ethereal communication,
				We remain your assistants
				SCA-REQUEST@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU
