I'll be arriving sometime on Saturday, Aug 13.  I'm staying in Horde Camp (not
Moritu), so I should be able to be found there.  If not there, try either the 
Archery Range, or ask for me at Freya's Garden in the Merchant's area.  She 
should be located across from the Barn, in the circle.

Hello there, I'm a pesky newby. At least I prefer that to the term 
'mundane'. I agree with most that you've said in your post. It's hard 

to snuggle in so to speak. I have had an interest in the Middle Ages 
for many years now. I've made costumes and attend Fairs and Yule tide 
feasts. But, up until a few weeks ago I have never had the pleasure 
of running into the SCA. Though I'd heard of it. I've made extensive 
studies of the Middle Ages and even run a BBS with Medieval Times as 
it's theme (throughout). But when visiting (for the first time) a SCA 
function I did feel like the outsider and was treated as such. I loved 
the atmosphere and the family feeling of togetherness, but I was on 
my own in figuring out "What goes here."A  Any Suggestions.

GREETINGS!

	My friends, although I have only recently tapped into the
net ,I do not wish to miss the oportunity to meet some of you at
the War. I will be arriving at least by Tues the 16th of Aug.
	I will be camping with Ekerhardt (Stonemarch Barony).
I've never been to Pensic before so I can't describe the campsite
location. My tent is a dark blue/black dome tent ,and I plan to 
set up a 12'x12' blue and white canopy. Please wander by and introduce 
yourselves. I'm tall  with longish drk blondish hair, and have an artificial 
arm  (that should narrow it down a bit).

	On another topic.. to all those people who sent me private mail
asking about Aikido dojos, I'll be posting the headquaters addresses for three 
kingdoms later on this week. Thanks for your patience.


	Also Iam considering flying my plane to the war although 
I'll have to get someone with a car to transport the heavy 
gear. Does anyone know if there is an airport near the site?

Good luck to all who go to the War,

actualy, before i get into what he writes, i'm still not sure what he means by 
'lw'.  Is this group trying to duplicate the heavy list using lighter weapons 
and armor?  If so, i think their efforts are doomed to failure.  I also think 
that their energy could be better spent agressively trying to reverse or at 
least diminish the trend  to heavier blows and armor. (an image rises in my 
mind of a Society with 4 or 5 lists in which the wight of the armor is a 
function of each lists antiquity as successive generations form new "light 
lists" and then succumb to the same escalation that made them forsake ther 
predecessors)
In Carolingia "light list" refers exclusively to rapier (fensing).  Although 
we also engage in spear-wresling and blind-folded, one-legged pillow fights, 
thes martial forms have no regular practices and are seldom done in tourneys.

		"..the other side is screaming, 'yes but we're supposed to be 
wearing armor, and I shouldn't have to die from a nick.'"

objection 1:  If you are wearing armor, and i am trying to kill you, my best 
strategy is to aim for the joins and other places the armor doesnt protects 
well, eg. around the neck, the under arm and forward shoulder, the eyes.  This 
would make for some rather ugly fighting (in my humble opinion.  some people 
may like to fight that way).  There for either you are not wearing armor and 
my sword should penetrate with out undo force, or i am not trying to kill you 
but merely playing a game, in which case you should accept my touch without my 
having to bruise you. (this argument is called "reductio ad absurdem".  It is 
not, despite the use of "you", and argument "ad hominum", and "you" doesn't 
even refer to m.Townsend, but to the people who call themselves "we" in the 
above quote (sorry for the digression, but a lot of people seem to be taking 
things personaly that werent meant that way (no i'm not refering to you)))

Objection 2:  If you (see disclaimer above) are supposed to be fighting 
rapier, are you sure you're supposed to be wearing armor?  Has anyone made a 
study of when rapier fights came up and what the contestants were wearing at 
the time?  They certainly didnt practice in armor, they practiced in padded 
jackets.  I think they wore swords most of the time, but did they also wear 
armor most of the time?  Or when they wanted to fight did they go home and arm 
up first?

Gratia vobis et pax a Deo Patre nostro et Domino Iesu Christo!
Message-ID: <880804235407.6.CONS.ELF@AIDA.UU.SE>

Five years ago, some mundanes in Visby (perhaps you've heard of
"Visby armor"?) on the island of Gotland, in the Baltic Sea east
of the Swedish mainland, got together and arranged a "medieval
week". Visby is an excellent place for it because the town has
lots of medieval houses and churches, and the medieval town wall
is still standing.

The Swedish SCA folks heard about it afterwards, and decided to
take part if the event was held again. Since then, the Visby week
has been our biggest annual event, and we are now just about to
go there for the fourth time. The SCA event is just a part of the
whole thing. Educational organizations in Visby arrange tours and
lectures, medieval music and theater in the streets, and a medieval
market. The grand finale is a re-enactment of the events in 1361
when Danish king Valdemar Atterdag defeated the local peasant
army and held the city to ransom.

There is also a "mundane" archery group, a jousting group, a non-
jousting equestrian group and possibly some other groups involved.
Thy Barony of Nordmark, besides contributing to the atmosphere by
walking the streets in garb, have three events during the week:
- a tourney which is not intended for the public.
- a fighting demo, and
- a revel.
(We also make up the bulk of Valdemar Atterdag's army in the re-
enactment theater.)

The demo is held just outside the town wall on a lawn where
very few modern buildings are in sight. Thy first year, it
attracted some 800 spectators. But the second and following
years, crowds of about 2,500 people have been normal. If the
weather is good, we expect even more this year because the
event is becoming more known.

The local TV station showed some 10 minutes one year, but the
national Television company (government-owned self-important
monopoly) have not been interested. Newspapers in the area have
done front-page articles about the SCA and published lots of
pictures.

But in spite of the tremendous attendance, we don't feel that
this demo has contributed significantly to recruiting new
members. A small demo at a mundane university is likely to
have greater effect. This shows that the size of a demo is
less important than the target group. You have to get the right
people watching you.

Good luck at Pennsic to all those unfortunates who can't come
to Visby 7-14 August.

Message-ID: <421927.880803.CENT@AI.AI.MIT.EDU>

As a Carolingian of rather older vintage than Justin du Coeur, I feel
obliged to comment on his remarks concerning the University of Carolingia.
The U of C, as i was given to understand, was founded as just a different
kind of event -- an attempt at recreating a student's day at a medieval
university.  Since a typical medieval student would by no means have spent
all day in classes or at study, the lectures (in persona on period
university subjects, as Justin noted) were complemented by the Student
Quarter: a selection, in another room of the site, of merchants, vagabond
speakers who would not have been accepted as lecturers at any proper
university, and varying degrees of other entertainment, depending on that
year's autocrat -- heretofore it has been an annual event.  Very early on,
Carolingia decided to allow this to be a low-key sort of demo, to attempt
to attract folks of like mind; through most of its history, the U of C was
publicized by posting notices of a "Medieval University" at local college
history (and similarly likely-sounding) depts, postering areas of potential
interest (e.g. Harvard Sq.), and sending notices to newspapers.  Since the
site was usually just outside Harvard Sq., we got a moderate number of
walk-ins merely by hanging enticing signs outside the door.  Along with the
merchants and guild booths there would be a table of SCA information manned
by our Magistra (outreach contact -- this office is now called Chatelaine
by the East Kingdom), and gentles would lend a hand explaining what was
going on to whoever asked.  All in all, a couple hundred people (including
the mundanes) would come, and after we closed up in the afternoon we would
usually go off to an SCA-only revel somewhere.  One year, the autocrat
tried to enlarge the experience by arranging a two-day event: the second
day was SCA-only, at which we met in a bunch of classrooms for seminars on
various medieval topics -- I don't recall whether this was even in garb,
but it was, as intended, a much less formal method for inculcation of
period knowledge.  It's worth noting that during this early period, the
situation was laid back enough that when the lectures were proceeding, the
Student Quarter emptied into the lecture hall, and the merchants often
wandered in to hear the lectures.
    This changed 4 years ago.  The autocrats that year were an active
household, and when they asked the seneschal's permission to run the event
at our regular baronial council meeting (that's how we do things in
Carolingia), they did warn us that they were planning to do something
different.  Different turned out to mean they wanted to create a MegaDemo.
They publicized the event much more widely than it had ever been before,
sending notices to all local radio stations (to be read as public service
announcements for this worthy non-profit organization), and even arranging
a mock-up council meeting in garb (we usually don't do council in garb) at
which one of the big local TV stations filmed a spot for its
local-entertainment show.  The response was both enormous and exhausting; i
believe we had about 1000 people (not necessarily all there at once), and
we turned a rather large profit.  I am not so sure about the success of the
event as an event -- since all the local SCA folk were busy working either
keeping the mundanes entertained or behind the scenes -- or as a demo (of
either the recruitment or educational variety).
    The next year (3 years back), someone else had been inspired to run the
same kind of university.  Again the massive publicity, again the pressure
on everyone in the barony to lend a hand, again the large mundane
attendance.  This particular U of C was advertised as a "Medieval Fair and
University".  Beyond my general attitude on how the U of C should be run,
this one gave me a bias on personal grounds; I was the Provost of the
University, i.e.  person in charge of lectures.  I gave an introductory
lecture on life in a typical medieval university, and introduced my 5
lecturers, who spoke on their various subjects; at best -- during my
lecture (the first one and the most general) -- the lectures drew a fifth
of the crowd that came during the intermission to see the scene from
Shakespeare, and at worst (toward the end) we had an audience of maybe 20.
There was continuous entertainment arranged for the Student Quarter; the
merchants, and most of the local SCA folk, could not attend the lectures
because they were too busy dealing with the fair aspect, and i do not doubt
that many of the mundanes never set foot in the lecture hall -- they had
come touristing to a medieval fair put on by some random group, and weren't
interested in presumably dry lectures off in the other room.
    These two MegaDemo-type U of Cs wore the barony out, at least for the
purpose of doing any more soon.  As a reaction to the lack of emphasis on
the university aspect, the next year (2 years back) the autocrat who ran
the U of C had it as an SCA-only event, not near Harvard Sq., with no
Student Quarter, and with a normal feast & revel at the same site after the
classes.  Recalling the U of C with seminars, he had 2 sets of classes
running concurrently -- standard U of C lectures in one hall, and seminars
in some nearby classrooms.  This U of C was a great respite after the
previous two instances, though many missed the diversions (and merchants)
of the Student Quarter.
    Last year, the fellow who intended to autocrat the U of C moved out of
town (for unrelated reasons) before he had arranged a site but leaving
basically no extra time to do so.  No one else felt up to taking over the
event, so we, regretfully, had to cancel it.
    This past spring, the most recent session of the U of C embodied a
compromise between the MegaDemo and the SCA event.  The site was again
near Harvard Sq., there was publicity to mundanes (though not the media
overload of the two years of enormity), and there was a Student Quarter
with a fair amount of arranged entertainment; on the other hand, the
entertainment was not scheduled against the lectures, there was lots of
encouragement (e.g. heralds' calls) to attend the lectures, and after we
shooed the mundanes out at the end of the day, we had a feast and revel
there during the evening.  I think total attendance was on the order of
500.
    At the May council meeting, when we did preliminary event scheduling
for the coming (SCA) year, no one proposed to autocrat another session of
the U of C; so we currently expect not to have one next spring.  This is
still fluid, and if one of our spring events falls through and someone
steps forward, some sort of U of C might happen -- but i would not lay
money on it.  Maybe someone will be inspired to run one the year after.

So, to conclude: The University of Carolingia has almost always been partly
a demo, but only for a couple of years was it a high-pressured MegaDemo.
During those sessions, the classes -- which are what make it a university
rather than just another medieval fair -- suffered grevious neglect.  I
have no qualms about holding widely publicized general-attendance demos, as
long as there are people willing to do the work, but the U of C makes a
low-key demo at best if it remains true to the emphasis on lectures, and a
poor university if it tries to keep the mundanes amused with demo-style
entertainment.  I would encourage anyone thinking of holding this kind of
event as a demo to go ahead and bluntly run a medieval fair, without
deluding potential lecturers into thinking they will have an attentive
audience.

 One thing that hurt me a great deal was my eating habits.  A question I

and would like some things to nibble on while shopping or watching the fighting.
I remember getting lots of headaches because I was missing these very wonder-

My lady and I are planning to be there some time on the fourteenth. We'll be

I should have elaborated further in my original posting.  There are a couple
of people interested in lw in my brother's group.  However, the "light
weapons are for swishy faggots" attitude keeps them from trying it.
Basically, if you fight light weapons, your a wimpy faggot.  It doesn't
matter that lw are allowed, because there's a huge amount a peer pressure
to "be tough, be a man."

Yeah, it was.  I'm not sure how it could be resolved, either.  On
one side, you have the "a touch is death" faction, while the other
side is screaming "yes, but we're supposed to be wearing armour, and
I shouldn't have to die from a nick!"

>Let's not get into a 'more chivalrous than thou' war, ok?

I didn't mean to start such a war, and I'm sorry if people felt
I issued a challenge.  My "respect" statement is based on watching
hw and lw people fight.  I realise there is a large amount of skill
involved in hw -- but I also think that lw is more *challenging* in
some aspects, but *not* as much in others.  A good lw person and a good
hw person will be good at different aspects of combat.  I (personally)
repect speed and accruacy over strength and endurance.  I didn't
mean to discredit hw as a part or a whole.

Gak.  Caught with me knickers down.  I (gasp) haven't applied for SCA

In An Tir there is an offical Kingdom level lesser office called Pied 
Piper. This office and its local reps. are incharge of organizing things 
for people under (I think) the age of 10. Many of the larger An Tir 
events have sites set aside with lots of things for smalls to do, including 
a Castle to play in, safe (and superviesd) boffering, etc.
 
We do have problems with smalls, but usually they are between the age 
of 11 and 13 or so. Most of the time someone will complain to the
 
constabulary, and we will be forced to make their parents watch them. 
This happens rarely, and I am glad to say, it works for the most part 
- as a deterrent. What kid wants to be forced to stay right next to 

their parents during an entire event or be banned from the site?

Is there a problem?  Sure, there are lots of children at events.  In
the west (or at least in the College of St. Katherine :-]) we just bop
them on the head as they go by and smile at them.  Then we turn around
and loose sight of them for half a millisecond and get bopped in
return.  Smalls are fun.  Rules keeping them in any particular place
are bad.

Subject: Demos, novices, and stuff like that


Ah, yes. Demos. Fun subject. And sufficiently complicated that Carolingia has
developed a standing committee, with monthly meetings, just to discuss it. The
following will be a ramble on the subject of demos, giving some of the ideas and
insights I've encountered in five years of running and helping with them.

There are *many* different ways to attract people. The simplest is the one that
Flashback discusses, simply getting a bunch of people wandering around in garb.
This, I've found, works very well at colleges and rather poorly anywhere else.
Even at colleges, it works best at the beginning of the year, before people have
started to attach themselves to activities already. Basically, the people that
you will pick up this way are the ones who have been really deeply looking for
the Society (whether they realize it or not), and who happen to be in the right
place at the right time. The latter is the problem; you don't get *many* people
this way; I've never gotten more than one or two recruits in any given try this
way. It can be a lot of fun, but if recruitment is the issue, it's pretty
inefficient. Remember: prospective SCAdians tend to be pretty shy. It's very
hard to come up to a bunch of people in weird clothes who are just wandering
around (as opposed to clearly trying to get your attention).

This brings us to the subject of Demos. There are really two sorts of demos:
recruiting and informational. They overlap a lot, but there tends to be a
difference in orientation. I'm only going to deal with recruiting demos, since
that's a complex enough subject on its own.

The first thing that a demo needs is an autocrat. This may seem obvious to
many, but we've seen some problems with it in the past. Running a good public
demo is at least as hard as running an event, and requires at least as much
organization. Carolingia's occasional MegaDemo (aka Public University) requires
more work than most Kingdom-level events. Therefore, remember: to have a good
demo, you need an enthusiastic, organized autocrat.

Next, you need to figure out what kind of audience the demo is for. If you're
going for a college crowd, you're lucky; colleges are the easiest groups to
run demos for. Most Caroligian college demos have simply consisted of bringing
fighting practice to the college, along with some dancers, some people
sewing, and a few people to talk to the inevitable gawkers. Indeed, since
many of our events are held at the area colleges, these events tend to have
a certain "demo" aspect to them; those of us who like talking to novices are
kept quite busy doing so.

If you're not running this at a college, the orientation generally needs to
be a little different. You're probably aiming at a slightly older audience,
that isn't going to be as easily swept in by the "fun" aspect of the SCA.
Most college students, I've found, get drawn in by the comaraderie of the
Society (this is why it's important to hold college demos *early* in the
season), and then get slowly prodded into developing personae and crafts.
The older crowd seems to be easier to influence intellectually, getting them
interested in a particular craft, then coming into the social group via that
craft. Thus, having a good representation of the crafts practiced in the
area is important at a public demo. (It's also a good thing at the college
demos, but it's not as critical).

The next question is: what is the scale of this thing going to be? This can
vary *wildly*, and the amount of work involved seems to be directly
proportional to it. The smallest sort of demo is the college activity fair.
Many colleges set aside an afternoon, very early in the season, where all
of the campus groups get together in a ballroom, each at a table, and try
to lure in the freshmen. The key to something like this, where you're just
one activity amongst many, is *flash*. Don't be modest; what you need here
is to attract some attention. Get a mannequin, and dress it up in armor in
front of the table. Lay out some feast gear, some fake period jewelry, some
newsletters, and maybe a deck of tarot cards. No, it isn't representative
of the Society, but it is interesting. The idea is to get people to your
first meeting. If you have a little space, put someone in a helmet, and
get someone else to hit them with some rattan. (This is how I first found
the Society; rattan hitting steel is a great attention-getter). With some
work, you should be able to get a *lot* of people to your first meeting.
90% of them will drop out after that meeting, but you'll be left with a
decent-sized core group; we usually wind up with 4-10 newbies at the third
meeting, most of whom stick around. After this, get them active *fast*;
bring them to fighting practice, dance practice, garb making workshops,
events, whatever ASAP. Otherwise, you'll have a serious falloff, as people
decide that the SCA doesn't *do* anything.

If you're running an independent demo, you need considerably more manpower.
Bringing a tourney or fighting practice along works quite well as the 
necessary attention-getter. Also, have as many people as possible doing
various things. Period games are a good way to get people involved; our
local fools guild has gotten into the habit of starting up what amounts
to a period form of catch (lots of people in a circle, tossing around a
beanbag with some streamers attached) at every possible opportunity, and 
it draws in more people than you could imagine (we frequently wind up
with forty people tossing the thing around). If you have anyone with a
spinning wheel, that will often get lots of attention. Dancing is always
a good draw, as long as the dancemaster is enthusiastic about teaching
lots of total novices (which isn't easy, believe me). And, most importantly,
have several people who are there primarily to talk to the gawkers who
just hang out and watch, but are too scared to get involved. Those gawkers,
as often as not, are where you're going to find the real SCAdians, the
ones who are fascinated by this stuff, but who are too shy to ask about it.

In short, running a good public demo requires every person you can get.
Figure one person whose sole job is publicity. Get a small notice in the
local paper, get some signs posted around. Organize a roving band of people
the day of the demo to wander around town, heralding the thing for all to
hear. Get a site well in advance. Town greens are ideal, if you can get
them: they tend to be central, and visible to all sorts of passersby.
Most of your audience is going to be people just wandering by, so you
should be as visible as possible. In general, the more people you have
there, the more attention you're going to get, so the more the merrier.
And make sure that the people going up to the gawkers have a good idea
of what they want to say, because 80% of the gawkers, when approached, will
say, "What is this?". (I've had days where I've given my standard SCA
spiel three dozen times. Sounding enthusiastic the thirtieth time you say
it is hard work).

Have a good idea, in advance, of how many people you want to attract.
The bigger it is, the earlier you have to start, and the better your
publicity has to be. The Carolingian Public University is the most extreme
case I've seen. In this, we invite the public in for a day of period
lectures (the lecturers are in persona the whole time, and are lecturing
on period topics), with a student quarter attached. There are merchants
galore, and all sorts of craft-y demonstrations in the student quarter.
The largest of these attracted the better part of a thousand people. To
do it required a year of work, a spot on television (PM magazine, or
something like that), groups of people crying the streets of Cambridge
the day of the event, and the full-out efforts of every member of a
pretty large Barony. A more normal well-organized demo, in a large town
or small city, can expect to get one or two hundred onlookers, of whom
about 5-10% will generally prove to actually be interested. To get more
people means putting in a *lot* of work, far more than most events.

Well, I've rambled too long as is (I'm holding the Demo Committee meeting
tonight, and have demos on the brain). What other advice to people have
for running a well-tuned demo? We're interested in anyone's experiences;
how do you think the "perfect" demo should run?

I had heard mention of fiberglass spears before (perhaps in TI?), and 
they seem to be catching on in the eastern realms.  Having never seen
or touched one, I would like some opinions of them:  How well do they
absorb impact? Do they wobble like rattan is known to do? What do they 
look like? are they lime green?  Will they take a coat of paint?  What
is poltruded as opposed to, say, the fiberglass they use to make bows
and such?

Subject: Re: cuir boilli 


I thought I might elaborate a little on the subject of Chromium leather
mentioned by Lord William. While its true that about half the fighters in
Nordmark wear it, its fairly hard to get at even here and its *very* expensive 
(about $15 per square foot, though leather is generally much more expensive in 
Sweden than in the US). 

The popularity of the material is mainly due to its ease of use, lightness
and relatively good protection. Its the thing to use if you want armour 
quickly. I know of one lord that has a whole outfit except helmet, collar ands 
gloves made from this. It took less than a month from his first ever 
fighter practise until he had a full suit. I myself have thigh protection and
vambraces made from it, and with camping-mat padding they are more than 
sufficient.

The material comes in about 6 foot pieces and is around 1/4 inch thick (6-10
 mm). It is roughly as flexy as masonite, but much harder to break. It will 
usually have to be dyed as the original colour is dirt grey with a print on.
To cut I only use mat-knife. To shape it it will have to be soaked in water 
for more than 24 hours and left to dry in the wanted shape.

It appears that this material was originally made to be brake-pads for railroad
cars. Sadly, railroads seem to use more modern stuff nowadays so chromium 
leather isnt made any more. Our only supply is a dealer that finds a few 
pieces every now and then in his stock.

Another material to use if you dont want to go through the troubles of 
hardening leather is what I call composite leather. It is simply two layers of
sturdy leather studded together with a closed-cell foam piece in between. 
Considering the price of chromium leather, this actually cheaper to do. The 
only thing to remember is that you dont want put the studs through  the foam, 
but rather leave an inch or so of extra leather on the edges to put the studs
in. Use leather studs.

Subject:  THose pesky newbies!

Getting started in groups can be such a hassle.
 I was heartend to hear about your groups outgoingness.
It works a little differently here.
Every year at the beginning of the fall semester they hold a newcomers revel.
But the impression I got when I went to my "newcomers" revel and some I have
attended after that was that they were very lacadaisical about getting new
people in (power struggles and politics are mostly the cause). It was very
difficult to find out exactly what this group did, what the sca in general did
(besides fighting), and all in all you got the impression that they didn't want
you.

We are a collage town 50,000 people of which 40,000 are students. A majority of
our shire mebership is made up of nonstudents or graduate students. They are
quite happy with whaty they have and are not interested in new people coming in
and possibly changing what goes on.

I know I have complained before and this sounds awfully whiney but I am really
irritated with this group. So to put some use while verbage into this message
let me discuss ways to get new people interested in our society.

First lets consider the type of people who usually do join, Usually the people
who join are in my opinion at least slightly more intelligent than the average,
further they tend to be "wierd", that is not to fit in in most places. (I joined
because I felt the world wasn't right for me...I saw people creating thier own
world that agreed with me more.), usually readers...mostly Fantasy and SF.(I
know I am being over general but it more or less fits most people in the
society.)

I think that the idea of recruitment is to present a more or less realistic
picture of what life is like in the society. I liked the idea of having everyone
in the shire wearing thier garb for a day in mundania. It would at least gather
peoples attention (plus we get to engage in that great sport...freaking the
mundanes) and if this is done on campus (for collage twns) it is likely to get
a picture in the campus paper. Or another way of accomplishing similar type
goals is to have every one go to a sports event or some such in garb. Have a
car wash in (old beat up) garb. There are a numder of possibilites along that
line oof thought. Any others?

Subject: sources of beeswax

The best cheap source of beeswax, whether you want it for candles, leather-
stiffening, sealing wax (for which you must mix it either with a gum or a
harder wax), waterproofing, or sealant (beeswax has antibacterial/mold/...
factors in it that makes it better to seal jellies and other potted foods, but
it is usually considered to be too much more expensive than paraffin), would
be to get a yellow pages and look under these categories:

	Honey, Apiary, Beeswax

Look for a source of honey that looks like a smallish apiary (for instance, a
small farmer who keeps a couple hives).  Call him/her up and say that you need
some beeswax--if you want to try to purify it (which isn't too hard) you should
be able to get it very cheap, if you shop around this way.  Many small pro-
ducers don't bother to purify and sell their beeswax.  Asking at farmstands
that sell honey can also lead you to sources.  There are a surprising number
of suburban apiaries, once you get past the ticky-tacky housing density belt,
so even if you are in the city, you may not have to go very far.

Subject: welcoming newcomers

From my church, I offer the suggestion of a "newcomers committee."  These 
people might be responsible for identifying neos, hosting them at feasts,
helping with name and device registration, garb design, and basically explain-
ing some of the quirks of SCA culture.  SCA people often assume that if people
can't "figure it out," then they maybe don't "belong."  I think that this is
more an issue of sloth, at its base, rather than agressive cliquishness--
combined with the fact that many SCA people are kind of shy about 
talking to
non-SCA people.  I think that a lot of the *impression* of clique-iness is
a product of this shyness and a certain bravado to cover the shyness.

Designating one person per activity (fighting practices already do this, I 
think) to be *responsible* for making sure that newcomers are welcomed and
integrated would probably be a better approach.  This person could always
spot a newcomer and delegate a "friend" to them.

Sorry, this may get long. Siobon touched a button  with her posting. I am a
firm believer in hardened leather and love to expound on it's virtues. While
more expensive than steel in raw costs, it is easy to shape, does not
require a full shop to work, is lighter than steel, can be as strong a
kydex, does not shatter or dent, lasts for years, and is irrefutably
mediaeval (it is a classical type of armour, i.e. Roman and Greek!).
Any how, to expand on her remarks:

In article <3271109@um.cc.umich.edu>, Pat_McGregor@UM.CC.UMICH.EDU writes:

The ratio was about 1:2 beeswax to parafin as I recall. The prefered mix was
actually 1:2 or even 1:1 Carnuba wax to parafin. Carnuba is a wax from some
tropical tree or other and is *hard*. In fact, the parafin is used to keep
it from becoming brittle. Being lazy (Carnuba is sometimes difficult to
locate), I use Sir Alan's method these days and just dump in a lot of wax
hardener (3 times suggested amount). It works well, even though the remelt
point is lower than the Carnuba blend.

> They heat the oven up to about 300 degrees.

Yow! I hope not. I try to keep the temperature down to 210 (effectively 190
to 240 or what a double boiler gives you), as far as possible below the
flash point of wax. This is warm enough to melt the wax and heat the
leather so it will absorb the wax easily. I just redid some of my armour,
including my 8 (?) year old cuisses and greaves. It was nice to have hard
legs again, instead of relying on the padding.

This is very important, you can get scalded badly by this stuff (another
reason for using the lowest possible temperature). I usually use a strap
looped through a slot on the armour as a closure (saves reriveting when the
strap streches), so I just put the strap on to set the approximate shape.
The use of tongs, et alia, for handling the leather will keep your hands
much happier. I also use a drip pan  below the brush between the wax and
the oven and to hold the brush between applications. I once watched a brush
disintigrate as the paste melted into the can of wax, very depressing.

Here is where I move away from the article by
> Siobhan (Hi there! -Bart )

The relative strength of the final product depends on the pretreatment of
the leather, the care in waxing it, and the weight of the leather. If the
leather has been treted with a softening agent, the wax will not hold well.
Most softeners impregnate the leather with oils, leaving little room for the
wax. Dry leather, on the other hand, has a tendency to singe, which also
retards wax takeup.

If you are doing this for the first time and without the advice of a
veteran, practice on several scraps of the leather you ar treating. In fact
this is a good idea at any time; every hide is different. Wax temperature
is critical. If the temperature is too low, only the suface gets hardened.
This will go unnoticed if you are using the dip method. Test the temperature
and timing for each batch with scraps until the leather is permeated with
the wax. If the temerature is too high, you get crispy, brittle, useless
leather.

The weight (thickness) of the leather also determines the strength of the
armour, but to a lesser extent than if no wax is used. The plates of my
Norman scale shirt are fairly light, about half the weight of sole leather
and slightly flexible, but heavy enough that I feel confident fighting
bastard or great sword wearing it and a medium-light gambeson. On the other
hand, the sole leather elbow cops have about the same flex as my 16 gage steel
knees.

I have no real objection to more modern materials, this is just the area
that I try to recreate the most closely, hence cuire boullee (yet another
spelling, most have at least one matching example in the literature) and
steel for my armour and steel or wood for shields. This leads into my
request. I am looking for ideas on how to make SCA armour look as authentic

Subject: semantics

The following comments adress severl issues brought up in many letters over 
the past week.  The common theme of most of them is that different words have 
different meanings and to avoid confusion or missunderstanding quite a bit of 
care must be excercised.

LIGHT WEAPONS.  Are "light weapons" and "light lists" the same as rapier 
(fencing)?  If not, please *always* specify what weapon form you mean.  
Rapier fought with foil, epee, u.s.w. is very different from shenai or pvc 
pipe.

RHINOHIDING.  the rhinohiding proplem and the escalation of blow strength 
propbelm are not the same thing and should never be mistaken for one another.  

Rhinohiding is a problem of an indiviual fighter who, wheather because the 
adrenalin in his system does not let him feel the blows, or because he is not 
well accostomed to the feel of blows in his armor, or some other reason, does 
not accept blow that most other people would consider valid.  This problem can 
only be solved on a case-by-case basis by the fighter in question, his fellow 
fighters, and his lady (or lady analog).  It can be lesend if all fighters are 
aware of teh potential problem and *all* society members show their 
appreciation of honor and courtesy on the field.

Escalation of Blow Strenth is the *average* strenght of a killing blow 
becoming higher throughout the fighting population.  Its causes are complex 
and ill understood and no solution has been found.

ARCHERY.  *please* make a distinction between "archery" and "combat archery".

Archery is a truly wonderfull art/sport requiring cooirdination and endurance, 
strength of arm, accuracy of eye, and tranquility of mind and soul.  While the 
archers who won the battles of creci and agincourt were not from the noble 
classes, noble men and women used bows for hunting.  Archery was one of the 
major skills of the samurai (esp. in peace time), and many notable norse 
warriors were great bowmen, as were many noble and justly famous saracen.
A good bowman could defend himself against 10 others, or make the difference 
between success and failure in a ship to ship battle.

OVERSTATING THE CASE.  Of course i overstate the case, its a standard 
rhetorical device.  If i stated it moderately, would any body read it?

I can imagine a society based on dancing and eating, but it would not be a 
*medieval* society, because we have almost no cooking sources befor the 14th 
century and many good ones in the 15th and 16th centuries and some important 
ones in the 17th century (digby, e.g.).  For dancing we have a few bugundian 
bassedances (brussel M.S., anyone know the date?)  Several dances from the 
italian high rennaissance, many dances from Arbeau (16th century), and the 
many, many dances from playford (entirely out of period).

Question:  can we have the "dream" without the code of chivalry, and can we 
have the code of chivalry without fighting?

    Good Gentles, Master Feral von Halstern has asked me to send this
letter concerning poltruded fiberglass spears.
    Contrary to the letter published in the August Pikestaff,
poltruded spears **WILL** be allowed this year at Pennsic.  As
poltruded spears seem to be better than rattan ones, this should be
good news to all spearmen.  Please disseminate this information as
widely as possible.
    Any questions regarding the acquisition of or standards for
poltruded spears should be directed to Master Feral.
    Thank you for your help in this matter.

  I think what we have here is a critical mass problem in a group.  In a
barony, I've noticed, a group will tend to stratify.  I guess you can call
this canalized thinking *mental hysteresis* 8^} because whatever the group
is doing always worked before so they don't change a winning stategy.  This
process unfortunately also makes it difficult for a newcomer to "break into"
any of the peer groups if he does not share their ideas on how things be.
  In smaller groups this problem does not appear to exist, probably because 
of the reason that the group has stayed small, namely, the constant turnover 
of people.  In our shire at least, we don't have the cliques that tend to bar
the newcomer.  It seems that we all enjoy doing something that will *wow* the
rest because its so outrageous!  When we have a newcomer, we usually throw a 
revel just to celebrate the occasion, sometimes we will wait and throw a 
newcomers revel for a group.  During the revel someone or maybe a bunch of 
folks will get with the new person and find what (s)he is interested in, then
this person will be put in touch with our most likely *expert* on the subject 
to start his/her SCA career.
  Our group is only 30 members plus or minus, with half that in transients, so
maybe this *all in the family* and has been around for five years now, so I 
think that the system works.  Of course, maybe our approach to newcomers isn't
a system at all, but just a decision on our part to not take ourselves too 
seriously when we live the dream.

Lots of things are approved on an SCA-wide level, but the kingdoms
decide if they want to do things or not.  There is no combat archery
in the Middle, no thrusting to the face in the East or the Middle,
and no fencing in the West.  If a fencer or an archer (I don't like
lumping all of them under "light weapons") wants to find lots of other
people interested in that area, convince a few influential peers that
this is a cool thing, go through the officers and the ensuing political 
repercussions and rigmarole, they could possibly do it.  More power
to them if they want to undertake this.  

The bit about respecting 'a lw people a thousand times more than hw.'
is bound to get you some interesting mail.  Wasn't it just a couple of
months ago that several people had said that fencing was seeing some of
the same blow escalation problems that plague 'hw'?  Let's not get 
into a 'more chivalrous than thou' war, ok?  The unchivalrous fighters
and rhinohides get a lot of exposure, but I can count the ones I know
of on the fingers of one hand.  

By the way, J. Eric, what is your SCA name?  I may have met you at TYC
and not remember.

RE: Archery
In fact, combat archery is one of the things that put an end to the
supremacy of knights on the field. Archery is not a weapon of nobility
or chivalry; it is a weapon of mass destruction. It could even be argued
that combat archery is against the very idea of chivalry. It's simply
too efficient. It's like bringing machine guns into OK corral.

But since many nobles in these Current Middle Ages are interested in
archery (myself one of them), I believe it should be allowed if possible
at wars. In my experience, what happens is usually that the archers
of one side end up taking out the archers of the other side, so they
really have little effect on the outcome. But if SCA archery is allowed
to be as efficient as the English longbow really was, any kindom which
comes to Pennsic with a force of 90 percent archers and 10 percent
would probably clean the field.

RE: Fire
From what I learned as a boy scout, you never build your camp fire on
the ground as it is. You dig a circular hole, about one yard across and
maybe ten or twenty inches deep, and make your fire in that. This greatly
reduces the risk of the fire spreading.

Even in very dry conditions, such fires are usually safe. But then,
Sweden is never quite as dry as some parts of the USA.

RE: Cuir bouilli
In Sweden, many fighters are using a type of leather called "chromium
leather" which is extremely tough and rather stiff. It may not be
period, but if you can get it, this is a good replacement for cuir
bouilli as long as you don't need to bend the pieces.

Hmmm, this is an interesting problem.

One could go for a day-care sort of approach, where one or more people
supervise a group of children, and thus keep them out of everyone's way.
This has a bunch of problems: Finding proper help, finding activities,
determining responsibility, etc.

I really think an event could be a fun experience for a child. There's a lot
to do and see, and a family experience to be had. Besides, there actually
were children in the middle ages (or so I'm told). I'd hate to see them
separated.

Perhaps areas containing sensitive stuff could be roped off and children
instructed not to enter. Perhaps a whole area of camp would be adults only.

It *would* be nice to have activities specifically directed at children.  An
easy picnic competition (like an egg-toss) would be terrific. I don't know
if they really did that, though. Perhaps some research is in order.

It's an interesting problem. I invite discussion.

I know of one - Duke Sir Talymar, who drove some fearful distance to be
excluded from the list.  That's why he's very careful to make the list
size variable; there is actually no compelling reason to fix the list
at 8, 16, 32, etc.  There are nice books of trees published for athletic
departments that predraw double-elim lists from 2 to n fighters, where n
is a large number.  They also are drawn in such a way that a fighter that
loses cannot face the victor in the loser's bracket until the semifinals
at the earliest.

I made my arm harnesses in 1981 using articulated elbows purchased from
Valerius Armories; the rerebraces and the vanbraces were made from heavy leather
(NOT sole leather) soaked in was.  I understand the correct material is beeswax;
I used paraffin ("candle wax") in which I dumped more than three times as
much hardener as candles require.  I used 10 pounds of wax in an improvised
double boiler over an electric stove (no open flames!); the boiler consisted of
two turkey roasting pans separated by wooden strips with water in the lower pan.

It's actually easier to make things from cuir bouilli than from plastic or metal;
cut your pieces and fit them; once fitted, melt the wax and insert leather pieces
until they stop bubbling.  This works best with pieces with no flaws, as the
leather changes dimensions as the was is absorbed.

When new, the armharnesses were about the weight of Kydex with the same 
yield strength (slight exaggeration; I once had a polearm shaft shear off
when I was hit on the forearm while wearing these).  Some people add steel
reinforcing bars on the outside, but I find them no necessary.

For materials, see any craft shop.

Not to mention that many events (I think Ducal is included in that) 
ban open fires as hazards. Speaking as a constable, I _much prefer_ 
people to cook on "stoves" or hibachis (sp?) than open fires.
 
The site that Ducal is heald at is mostly open (dry) field, with some 
trees and a stream on one side. A fire there could cover a lot of ground 
(and tents...) in a very short time. Yes, please bring something to 

cook on!

Subject: Domesday Notice

This is your last chance to get into the first edition of the Electronic
Domesday Book! I'll be starting to get all the data into my database this
weekend, and I plan on putting out the first edition immediately before
Pennsic. It will go electronically over the net, and I will have printed
copies available at the War for some nominal cost (probably 25 cents).

About a hundred people have talked to me about this, or have indicated to
Danulf that they want to be in the book. If you have not done either of
these, and you would like to be in the book (which is going to essentially
be an SCA "telephone book" for the net), send me:

1) SCA name & Mundane Name
2) SCA location (Kingdom & Barony or Shire) &
   Mundane location (State and town)
3) Titles and offices
4) Interests
5) Net address (Inter/ARPAnet format preferred)

and send it *soon*! There will be future editions, but it'll probably be
a few months before the next one.

Also, if you have any ideas of what to call this thing, talk to me. I've
been planning on "The Crystal Domesday Boke", but this makes our local
herald cringe. He suggested simply "The Codex", but that doesn't get the
point across. One person has suggested something like "The Ethereal
Domesday Boke", which rather appeals to me, since several of us have been
batting about the name of "House Ethereal" as the SCA name for the Net.
On the other hand, this might get some people annoyed (due to the
"claiming deification" rule). Ideas, anyone? If so, send them fast, because
I need to get this thing out.

Subject: Cuirbolli

The fighters in Northwoods (Lansing, Mi) have developed a method
of making cuirboilli which saves the trouble of having a huge vat
of melted wax.
 
They use beeswax mixed with parafin (I forget the exact ratio --
perhaps Lord Bartholomew can remember?), melted in a coffee can
sitting in a large pot of water on the stove. They heat the oven
up to about 300 degrees. Then, they put the armor piece on a
cookie tin covered with brown paper. Using an old 2" paintbrush,
they stroke the liquid wax over the finished side of the piece
until it is "wet" all over.
 
The armor then goes into the oven until all the wax has melted
into the leather. (The surface will stop looking wet and start
looking matte finished when the wax has soaked in.) Repeat on the
dyed or finished side until the wax shows through on the
unfinished side. (Some folks like the unfinished side to look
very wet, some leave it just damp. Personal Preference, I think.)
 
While the leather is "Cooking" for the last time, have the
fighter wrap his/her leg or arm in a towel which is then covered
with several layers of newspaper. (If he or she is wearing the
fighting pants which will be worn under the armor, the towel is
unecessary. DO use the plastic wrap and newspapers, tho!!!)
 
When the armor comes out for the last time, QUICKLY shape the
armor around the limb. ("Quickly" is a relative term, here. You
want to do this before the wax starts to set, but slowly enough
not to crack the leather.) Tie off the armor piece to the fighter
with soft cloths, old nylon hosery, or some other strapping
material. Let the fighter sit and watch TV or do calligraphy or
whatever for half and hour to an hour while the leather cools and
shapes.
 
Then you can add straps, buckles, extra metal, or whatever.
 
This method is guaranteed to keep the owner of the kitchen
happier with the fighters and their "mess."
 
CAUTIONS: "Cook" the armor on a shelf set in the middle of the
oven. It should never been within 4 inches of the broiler. DON'T
put waxy leather in the oven while it's preheating, or the
broiler will fry or burn it. Don't so overcoat the piece that wax
drips off onto the element of the stove, or you'll end up calling
the fire department. Many small coats of wax, layered on, work
better.

Subject: Cuirboilli notes; letters of intent (ho-hum ;-)
Message-Id: <586200373/kee@A.NL.CS.CMU.EDU>

A few quick notes on making cuirboilli:   Always use some kind of
double-boiler arrangement when heating the wax.  (That is, don't heat
it directly over the flame/electric element.)  We have used two sturdy
disposable aluminum turkey-roasting pans.  One you fill with about an
inch of water; the other you distort slightly so that it sits securely
over top of the first.  Then you heat the water in the first, set the
second one over top of the first, and melt the wax in the second one.
This cuts down the risk of fire quite a bit, and the turkey pans are
big enough to get largish pieces of leather into.  If the second pan
has a tendency to sink into the pan holding the water, you can take
a few big spoons, turn them round side up, and lay them in the first
pan so that they support the bottom of the second pan.

We use aluminum or galvinized steel forms to mold the hot leather onto
when we take it out of the wax.  If you screw up, you can always
re-heat.  We haul the hot leather out with long-handled tongs or pliers.
Wax will come off the tools when they are rinsed in very hot water.
We also wear work gloves when handling this stuff.

The leather doesn't exactly get "boiled"; it gets soaked in the hot wax
until the little bubbles rising from it become infreqent.  I think
there is more info on this in a T.I. someplace.

Re:  letters of intent for Crown (please skip this if you are bored
with this topic.)
While I sympathize with the frustration many of us feel over the
amounts of paperwork involved in SCA stuff, I think the letter of
intent is a reasonable requirement.  It's a written committment to
undertake the duties and responsibilities of the Crown, should the
fighter gain the Throne.  Currently the East is so huge that the work
involved in being Royalty requires a near-superhuman effort.  In
practice, it is pretty rare for an Eastern Monarch to ban a fighter
from Crown Tourney, and the Crown list is accessible to any fighter who
is a member, has lived here for more than a few months, and sends in a
letter of intent.  The notion of letters of intent being abused in some
way by the Monarchs or the Kingdom Seneschale is a very foreign one to
me, though I can see how it could happen.

Another point, which I don't recall seeing mentioned here yet, is that
in the East any fighter or consort can honorably withdraw at any time during 
the tourney, if they discover that they really don't want to be on the
Throne.  If either half of the fighter/consort team withdraws, the
other half is automatically withdrawn also.  Kingdom laws vary a good
deal in regards to this kind of thing, and probably that has a lot to
do with different problems arising in different Kingdoms.  The laws are
frequently changed in response to messes of one kind or another.

I think it's important to keep in mind that many variations of these
rules have been working for different Kingdoms.  I think there's very
little here that needs to be written in stone.

Greetings!

To be quite honest, I have never liked the usage of "Domesday Book" in
the SCA.  The original was not a phone book, it was a tax roll.  It
did, to some extent, identify and list people by location, but that
was a secondary purpose.  A closer analogy might be a Roll of Arms.
These were collections of the names and arms of the great nobles of
the realm, or a portion thereof.  These rolls tend to be named after
the author, as Glover's Roll.  Thus, a possible alternative name for
this collection of names & addresses (and arms?) might be "Justin's
Roll", or, more fully, "Justin's Roll of the Names and Locations of
the Gentlefolk of the Various Domains."  After all, they DO call
branches of the net "domains"...

I am curious about the rationale for this rule; plate was certainly not proof
against arrows during the 100 Years War, as King John of France could attest.
Plate was proof against the longer range flight arrows, but not against the
armor-piercing "sheaf" arrows.  I realize that there were harnesses made
that would stop even musket balls (such as those common among siege engineers)
but these were not worn on the field by foot or horse.

There is also a bascinet allegedly worn by Joan of Arc which has a hole (only
partial penetration) from a crossbow quarrel, as well as a skullcap found in
a moat with two holes from projectile weapons that met in the center of the
head.

I understood light weapons to be approved on a SCA-wide level.  Maybe
he could find some others interested in lw, and start their own lw
group.

As far as "swishy", I know several people who do hw in Meridies
because their still aren't enough lw people around (most are fencers
originally).  I respect a lw people a thousand times more than hw.
(I've found that the "stick jock" problem doesn't exist in lw as
badly as it does in hw.  Maybe it's just a local phenomenon.)

As Historian of Carolingia I feel compelled to elaborate on this tale
as it has come to me:

	In the latter days of the first King of the East a tournament
was held to see who should follow on the throne. <It may have been
held in Carolingia, but I won't swear to it.> As the fighters were
preparing a crowd gathered, from which a man approached the Marshal to
inquire what was going on. Informed (in general terms), he asked if
anyone could participate and was told all they needed was armor,
weapons, and a lady to fight for. All three were quickly arranged
(these were the _real_ early days) and he proceeded to sweep the field
as "Alpin McGregor of Gotz-Karlsberg". (Unknown to the world he held
black belts in several martial arts.) The Coronation was held
immediately thereafter, whereupon Alpin learned _exactly_ what he had
gotten into. He sat on the throne that day and no other: the heirs
were crowned by the Queen. He was seen again but once, or so legend
has it. Many years later a man stopped by to watch a tourney in
Carolingia (where he resided when he won the throne) and was
recognized by one of the witnesses to the original feat.

Someone else mentioned this. What kind of wax is used (there's candle wax,
boot bax, Dr. Z's Sex Wax, Gulf wax, ski wax, etc.)? I would guess something
that's very stiff when cooled, like Gulf wax one might find in a grocery

My first attempt is probably going to be thin leather over 12 guage (or is
it 10?) aluminum. The stuff is light, somewhat resilient, and strong as
hell. I found an old dremel-like moto-tool in my closet that'll be a boon
for rounding edges, fine shaping, and drilling holes.

I found an inexpensive source for various foams by the yard, including
ensolite. I also found velcro strips in varous widths up to 2 inches wide.
The way I figger it, you sew the velcro to some leather, put some buckles on
it for looks, and you get that "must've taken 15 minutes to strap on" look
with a 14 minute savings.

Sean

P.S. I've had people reply to the velcro idea: "They probably won't approve
it as safe because it might work loose".  To anyone that thinks that a proper
velcro closure might work loose: take a look at a high performance parachute
rig and see what holds the lines to the harness. Of course, the ultimate way
to convince someone is to make the stuff, put it on, and challenge someone
to pull it loose.

Coranna of Cavan / Laurie Cavanaugh
Principality of the Mists, West Kingdom
----------

The formula for crossbows is 640 inch pounds.  For example, if you
have a crossbow with a 10 inch draw it can have a pull of 64 pounds.

What Coranna forgot to mentions is that there are also javalin (sp?)
light fighters.  Javalins are pvc tube with padded tips with a 2 inch
give.  Some have streamers and/or fletching.  Most fighters have
less to complain about with javalins as there is no need for the
screen.

Another thing to note.  In the West, plate is proof against arrows.
Most good arrow shots can be felt through other types of armor.
Javalin shots are good on all armor except the helm or shield.
A well made javalin is also pretty obvious when it hits.

One more safety factor.  During any battle where there is archery
all marshals and/or heralds on the field must wear head protection.
Either a fenching mask with something covering the back of the head,
or equivalent.  Frankly, I would be concerned about my eyes if I
was out there without head protection during an archery battle.

I can write at length about all the current West Kingdom rules concerning
combat archery if there is any interest.  If anyone would like a
copy of the current rules for the West, I would be more than happy
to send them.

But believe it or not I actually have a [fairly] logical reasson. I do not like
increased hassle and annoyance. I have to put up with so much of it in the
mundane world that I begrudge the slightest encroachment in the society. If a

No, milady, in the Middle the King decides how large his list
will be: he sets an upper bound, such as 32. The Chivalry who
reserve are guaranteed a place in this list, and then the rest of
the slots are filled from the unbelted fighters who are invited
to fight in Crown by His Majesty. Generally the list is generated
in preferential order, with the unbelted fighters from the top of
the list taking the first remaining slots, and so on. It's not as
dire as it sounds: at any given Crown, any number of Chivalry do
not fight, and a number of the invited unbelteds decide not to
fight. In 10 years (a mere youngling, I know) of seeing Crowns
run this way, I have never seen an unbelted fighter turned away
because there was no more room.
 
Perhaps the missing piece of information here is that the Middle
has an invitational Crown List.

I don't wish to argue with you about Chivalry and truthfulness,
milady, because I would also hope that we could trust folks.
Unfortunately, there have been occasions where people believed
they were members and sadly were not.
 
As a side note, the Board is currently taking opinions concerning
the issue of membership requirements for offices, including
Royalty. Perhaps you should write with your opinions, in a place
where they might do some good.

Preference is preference. Some Kings call people to tell them
why they should not fight, and some write letters. Generally,
prevention of annoyance such as you mention is a large consideration,
and prevention of embarrassment and unpleasantness.

Subject: Re:re: letters of intent

As I mentioned, I understand that different rules develop in different
places to deal with different situations.  There is an old saying 
that half of the rules of the lists were developed to stop Henrik of
Havn from doing something, and the other half were invented to stop
Richard the Short from doing something.  I was under the impression
that The List (said with a reverent echo) could be sent to each kingdom
with the mailing labels for the kingdom newsletter.  It is supposed 
to match the list of mailing labels (to BE the list of mailing labels?),
but I know that this is not always the case.  How *do* the seneshals 
check out the memberships?  A long-distance call would be impractical
for transferring that much information, I would think, and we all 
know about letters and the Registry.  What kind of evidence is accepted
as proof of residence for the required length of time?  

I never meant to imply that it was unreasonable to expect prospective
combatants to write a letter of intent.  It works nicely in many 
kingdoms, apparently. I agree that it takes away from the atmosphere of
an event(to put it lightly) when the king performs a knighting ceremony 
wearing the kingdom tabard over blue jeans and bare arms,  but most of the 
time (in my experience, anyway) the incredible unexpected victor turns out 
to be a fine monarch.  There are few things accepted by all of the West
without question, and laws get changed quite a bit.  I think this 
adds an interesting period flavor to courts and such.  Others may be
quite horrified.  Say, what do they do in Trimaris, Atlantia, Atenveldt?
Come on, good gentles, don't let the Easties, Westies, and Sir Alan 
have all the say...:-)

Any officer can request a zip-sorted listing of their area of
authority from the Registry at any time. For most officers there is
a small charge for this ($2?) For the Kingdom Seneschals, they can
request a list valid as of the first of the month in which the Crown
list is to be fought. I think it's free, but...
 
As I said in a previous mailing, a List valid for, say, May 1, would
be printed about April 15th, and would have in it only folks who had
managed to renew by April 1 or thereabouts. In the past people have
used photocopies of checks and membership forms, dated as of, say,
May 1, but recent rulings by the Board (I think -- I'm away from my
corporate files) make this less acceptable.

Here are some replies and comments to various things contained in
SCA Digest #62.

The debate on medieval fighting, and some other letters in the
Digest too, really seem to come down to that crucial question which
was asked by Sean Casey: "When the goals of appearing medieval and
having fun clash, which wins?"

I believe this is really at the core of the different opinions about
how and what the SCA should be and do. Modern lightweight plastic
armour versus period heavy steel. Modern easy-to-wash fabrics in
garb versus authentic cloth. Nylon pavillions versus silk or whatever
they really used. Plastic coolers and modern camping equipment versus
attempts at recreating medieval personal gear.

Somewhere on the scale from "completely medieval" to "modern and
mundane" we must find a point where we can claim to be recreating
and reenacting medieval life, while reatinig an acceptable level of
comfort and safety. Opinions about exactly where this point lies
will always vary, and in practical life we must not set our rules
so far on the authentic side that people are excluded from partici-
pation because they can't afford the equipment or they don't have
the time to make all the gear needed for authenticity.

On the other hand, the SCA must reward and honor all attempts at
authenticity. We should not outlaw modern comfort except when it
becomes truly offensive, but we should promote and encourage those
who try to be a bit more authentic than the minimum requirements.

------------------
I thank Lord Mustapha al-Muhaddith (Russel Almond) for his kind
words on us Swedes. It is encouraging to see that at least some-
one agrees with some of my views. Be comforted, milord: there is
one of your co-religionists here: Michael Almansur FitzRoderick
the Moor. If you ever come to Nordmark we could almost have a
Crusade!

-------------------
Milord Kwellend Njal, I assure you that no offense was taken at
"Bill the Crow" except jokingly - an excuse for a friendly challenge
is always fun (well, at least as long as the opponent doesn't turn
out to be a Heavy Battleship Class Duke).

And yes, in High Medieval England, among the nobility, "Guillaume"
would have been the name. They spoke Norman French, at least in the
12th Century where I belong. The name of my persona was invented to
sound nice, like "William de Warenne" or "William Marshal". Using
the English "William" is a concession to the fact that English is
the language of the SCA. Makes things simpler.

Many good wishes to ye all from

About half our events are non-fighting events.  (It appears that this coming
October, November, December, January and February events will all be
non-fighting events.  Non-rattan, at any rate.)  On the other hand, we just had
our first non-dancing event in over a year and a half.

Obviously, in the competition for most-important-activity, dancing is either
first or a close second to feasting.

	I think that David was confusing Sir Syf and Matsushita Ariko (spelling
almost certainly wrong.)  Ariko was KM of the Steppes when I left in AS 19,
and a very technically proficient fighter.  She was on the small side,
around 5'5" and with a light build.  Sir Syf was (and I assume is) 
taller and of a more medium build, and swung a mean wrap shot...

Huh? Fighting important? Tis small compared to the FEAST. I've heard
several proclaim: "If the food is great, people will be happy about your
event".

Of course, the very most important thing is the Dream and Code of Chivalry.
Without these, fighting has no honor and a Feast is just another dinner.

     This may be but one of a rash of replies to your inquiry.  If so,
my apologies for the duplication.

     In my most limited experience, I have found a combination of approximately
25% paraffin (available in most supermarkets, I believe it is used in
canning) to 75% pure beeswax (more expensive, and harder to find, but worth 
it) makes a good wax for cuir bouillir (literally, "to boil leather," though
this, too, may be a mangling of the French).
     Paraffin alone is not acceptable, as it doesn't soak deeply enough into
the leather to make a strong surface that won't crack.
     Beeswax alone makes a good, strong surface.  Until it gets really hot.
Then it melts.  Ever try to fight in several pounds of sticky beeswax?  No
good.
     If you can't get beeswax direct from someone with a hive, you may be
able to get some cakes of it at Pennsic, or through somebody on the net.
*Don't* buy it in the tiny discs from sewing supply stores, unless you have
lots of money you don't know what to do with.  You'll need at least a few
pounds, if you want to do a breastplate, vambraces, rerebraces, etc.  I
think there have been some good articles on the subject in past T.I.s,
that cover the area more thoroughly than I am able.  Try to find someone
with back issues, if possible.
     I have also heard of brine being used instead of wax, but I cannot
vouch for this at all.  The ideal, however, is a very hard, yet light
piece of armor that resists cracking, bending and that eternal, yet smelly
foe of untreated leather, moisture rot.
     Don't hesitate to contact me if you need any more info, though I will
be gloriously absent (i.e., at Pennsic) from August 6th onwards.

>>When the goals of appearing medieval and of having fun clash, which wins?

er ... Sean, you may have gotten the impression from me before that
I fall on the side of appearing medieval (maybe that night in High
on Rose when I was getting uppity about that aluminum?).  I actually
fall somewhere in the middle.  I get upset about aluminum in particular
(for armor) because it gives the fighter a different weight/strength
ratio -- something which would have effects on the styles of fighting
which occur.

But that's really a minor point when you come down to it.

Yeah!  Or ask Kwelland about the lady knight in Ansteorra which he knew.

um, while plastic armor may work really well and be light and all that
stuff it just looks *awful*.  At least the set I saw did -- it was a bunch
of strips cut from a 5 gallon plastic bucket, and the strips hung partially
overlapping (brigintine?  I'm not really up on armor terms).  It was bright
yellow and ugly.  Made out of any other material it would have looked a
lot nicer.

I'd rather see you in carpet & duct tape before plastic.  At least the
duct tape can fool people from a long distance away.  But that's just
my preference -- I'm not a marshall.

Greetings!

The purpose of letters of intent for crown tournament is to ensure
that the Royalty know beforehand who plans to fight in Their Crown
Tourney, and that each entrant satisfies the Laws governing such
tournaments.  For example, in the East, letters of intent must include
proof of valid membership, a corporate requirement.  They must include
evidence that both the fighter and consort have lived in the East and
have been active SCA members in the East for a sufficient period of
time, as specified by Law.  Furthermore, the letters guarantee that
each lord fighting has a lady for whom to fight.

The Royalty are responsible for ensuring that the tournament is
properly run, and that each entrant is qualified to rule the Kingdom.
Without prior knowledge of the entrants, they could not hope to
perform this duty.

No fighter should enter crown tourney if he "...jsut want[s to]
fight."  The purpose of Crown Tourney is to compete for the Crown.  In
the Rules of the List it states that every fighter shall make an
honorable effort to win the Crown.  To enter just for the fun of it is
an offense against law, custom, and honor.

I hope that clears it up.

	Arval.

Rob,

***
In reference to two letters from SCA Digest #61:

It is not that religion or magic is banned in the SCA; people are allowed to be
members of the clergy (we have a number of nuns, monks, and even a Bishop!).
The idea is to not impose your religous beliefs on others.  I have attended
several events (notably War of Roses in Concordia and Pennsic) where catholic
masses were held for anyone wishing to attend by a gentle who is a priest in
mundane life.  Care must be taken in proclaiming yourself a high church
official, tho.  That could be construed as equivalent to claiming yourself a
knight or peer.

I believe the sensitivity toward magical practices or claims of being a witch
etc. has a lot to do with the cult sensitivity in the States.   I feel that if
you want to be one, fine, just be careful of advertising the fact outside of the
SCA or in relation to the SCA to the mundane world.  We certainly don't need the
(however incorrect, but when has the media been known to care) publicity of
being a cult or being related to a cult.

On the issue of studying the practices in relation to the history...Yes!  The
Church  had a very strong involvement in the social and moral climate of the
Middle Ages.  The study of alchemy, astrology, etc. are equivalent to the study
of herbology, cooking, smithing.  All part of the times.

As a slight aside, I must admit that it is hard to separate my knowledge and
beliefs gained from being a "Modern" woman from my love and participation in the
SCA.  It is hard to admit that I can't read or write, or that I am willing to
accept the King's word as law when that law directly affects my (SCA) life.

I have one more question before I stop (I promise!).  There has been a number of
crafted articles that have been made as trophies, prizes, etc. for large scale
groups in the SCA (the Pennsic horn, the Kings of the East tapestry made for the
East Kingdom XXth anniversary, etc.) that are presented, shown, then disappear.
Where do they go?  Who gets to keep them between displays?  How are they kept
track of so they don't just vanish into someone's attic?  I would love to see an
entire display of the East Kingdom (only because that is my home) Regalia at
some event, with credit given to the artisans that put so much of themselves
into their work.

Subject: Fighters Letters of Intent

I understand that different kingdoms have their reasons for running
things the way they do, but I am happy tp live in a kingdom in which 
I can decide at the last minute that I really do want to fight in 
Crown, go sign up, be inspected, and get in line for Invocation all
within an hour.  Lady Siobhan eloquently stated the reasoning behind 
the way the Middle has letters of intent; here is how the West deals 
with the same situation.

1) It is true that nobody knows how many belteds or unbelteds will be
in the list until signups close.  To equalize the number, the King 
will select unbelted fighters of great chivalry and prowess to fight
'with the chivalry'.  (The unbelteds each challenge a knight to determine
the pairings for the first round.) It is a great honor to be made thus
a 'knight for the day'.  

2)Memberships are checked from The List, received from the registrar.
If you aren't on the list and can't prove you're a member (card, or 
current newsletter), you don't fight, or you aren't fought for.  This
can drag out the list signups, so the Listmistress sometimes opens
signups on Friday night, for the earlybirds to get it over with early.

3) I have never heard of the King exercising his right to bar a fighter
from the lists. (this may have happened, but if it did, it was kept
quiet, a tough thing in any kingdom, I imagine :-)) The list has its own
system of checks and balances.  'Ducal prerogative' is one, though it
is also rarely exercised.  (a duke may drop out of the lists at any
point for any reason.  other fighters may drop out from injury or heat
exhaustion)  Sometimes someone unexpected wins, which is part of the
fun.  

Do other Kingdoms deal with these things in different ways than letters
off intent (Middle) or letting the list take its course (West)?

I'm not aware of any lady knights here (although there is at least one
lady right on the brink). When/who was this? (just curious)
Actually I just remembered Sir Syf (sp?).  Is this who we are refering
to?

Why has no one heard of surcotes? Surcotes will cover even the ugliest
armor and have to be as easy to make as a T-tunic. If you make aluminum
armor (and I'm not going to argue whether this is an unfair advantage
or not) at least cover it with a surcote since aluminum has a very
distinctive look to it.

Along the lines of light armor the trend around here is to fight in
minimal armor. This often means no thigh protection and very little
torso protection. Remember that these places are only recommended to
be armored, not required. As K.M. I can only grit my teeth and make
suggestions and perhaps a few bruises. *:-) The reasoning behind
the lack of armor seems to be a combination of the hot (*hot*) South
Texas weather and the increased mobility allowed. Of course the trade-
off is that I don't groan in pain every time I get hit in the legs.

As for light people I am about 6'2" and weigh about 155 lbs. I wear
pretty full torso armor but it is Coer bu lais (how *does* one spell 
that?). This is leather boiled in wax. I have had my body armor for
maybe 6 years and it has been great. It is as strong as steel and
I have never been hurt through  it.  Plus it is light and somewhat
historically accurate. The layer of close-cell and the gambeson
underneath also do a lot for protection. For legs I wear articulated
metal knees with heavy leather cuisses (not boiled in wax) padded
again with close-cell foam. If I want more protection I put metal
strips running either inside or outside the leather. Total weight?
Maybe 20-35 lbs. Even though this armor looks fairly nice as is, I
still wear a surcote.  *:-)

This has gone on long enough....

Subject: The Weird Swedes



May Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful, grant William and all of
the people of Nordmark Peace!

It is good to hear from people who live far away, and to hear that the
Dream translates into other languages as well.  I know of one other
group which has your unique language situation, and that is l'Isle du
Dragon Dormant, whose inhabitants are primarily French-speaking
Canadians.  All of them that I have met have been exceedingly pleasant
people who I have been glad to know.  I was also pleased to see a
citizen of your Barony was in attendance at the Boredom War.  It
greatly heartened me to see someone travelling so far for an event,
even if I did not have time to speak with him myself (that is the last
time I volunteer to be in charge of both fencing and cleanup at the
same event).

I would like to say that I feel much the same way as you do about the
Arts and Sciences competition.  As a matter of fact, here in
Carolingia we tend to run very few of them.  Instead I have been at
one or two events at which Arts and Sciences were displayed, yet not
judged (something which I have personal problems with).  The usual
format seems to be as part of an exhibition for the Baron, or for the
populace (as a fair).  

As far as your feeling about religion go, I agree, it is difficult to
separate Church from persona.  On the other hand, it is important to
remember that our purpose is to teach, not to preach.  I think that
religeous gestures add to the suspension of disbelief, when handled in
such a way as to make sure there is no pressure on the other person to
conform.  (The inquisition is one of those things I would rather not
re-create, thank you).

In short, I am please to hear from you and glad that you are a part of
the current middle ages, although I do not believe you are as wierd as
you claim.  And I hope that someday, Inshallah, I will have the time
and money to take you up on your kind invitation.

Ah, to live in the West, where the Registry is just around the corner.
Obtaining a membership list out here ranges from difficult to
impossible, and it has been conclusively shown not to be reliable
enough in practice.

Once upon a time, many years ago, an unknown "mundie" (he wasn't, but
played the part) walked into an Eastern Crown & won it.  This caused
more problems than are worth listing.  As I said, this was long ago.
However, there are still requirements that must be met, and expecting
to check them at the last minute is not reasonable.  

In general, the philosophy, accepted in the East without cavil, is
that if you want to undertake the great responsibility of the Crown,
it is quite reasonable to require you and your lady each to write one
letter a few weeks ahead of time.

plates sewn _inside_ layers of cloth (i.e. not visible).  All that can be
seen from the outside is the rivet heads.

	My appologies my lord, it was just my poor knowledge of
those southern languages that led me to that translation.  No
offense was intended.

	On the subject of names, what is your approx. year?  
Through a fair bit of our period (and certainly through what
is often called the "High Middle Ages") Guillaume would have
been more acceptable than William to the nobility of England.
Again, no offense, mearly curiosity.

>If this is so I don't really want to be involved.

	While I think Malice et al over stated the case, there is some
truth to the idea.  Most of us would consider that someone who *only*
fights is missing a lot, but there are few events that don't have 
fighting.  And certainly, in most (if not all) places the most common
meeting is fighter practice.  There are groups around that practice all
of the things that we do, ussually several on the national level, but
we alone actually get into the use of weapons and armor that simulates
those of period (yes, I know about Markland, but their weapons do not
simulate period, and thier armor is lighter.)  That is one of the reasons
that golf tube arrows are having such a hard time winning acceptance,
they just don't *act* like the real thing.  

	But, (!)  saying that it is the most important thing isn't 
quite the same thing as saying that that is all we do.  Just as 
51% is a majority, fighting can be said to be the *most* important
thing that we do.  But of the that 51% that is the fighting, it isn't
100% fighters.  There are the people running the list, the marshall's
keeping it safe, the heralds announcing the fighters and the winners,
the lords and ladies non-combattant adding to the airs of the event...
So perhaps saying that fighting is the most important is the wrong 
way to look at it.  Perhaps the "tournement" is the most important
thing we do.  Fighting may be what sets us apart, but without
the rest of the people its just something else we do (or else you'd
have people who just went to fighter practice and that's all.)

	(As a side note, how would people feel if we had the heralds
announce either both the fighters name and the name of the lord or
lady being fought for, or even just the name of the person being
fought for?  Personally, I think this would add something to the 
event...)

	Yep, you are going to find people like that everywhere, in almost
any type of recreation.  As you've seen on here, there are a number of
people who will sneer at someone who just fights!  Look at the figures 
for last years Pennsic. About 1250 fighters... and 5000 people.  4-1 
sounds like a lot of people who don't fight to me.  There were 
probably more fighters there than any other single part of the society,
but they were outnumbered.  Would thef event draw that many people
without the fighting?  Probably not.  Would it draw that many fighters
if it wern't for the other people?  Probably not.

ah, but it looks so *neat* having all these arrows flying around
the field ... :-)

My "experience" with combat archery is at the two Border Raids which I
have attended.  (The Border Raids is an interkingdom war between the
Middle and the Meridies every June).  The Meridies is actively
experimenting with combat archery and has some very good archers.

This year there were two sorts of combat archers.  One -- wearing
minimum armor but a full helm -- were 'light' archers.  These people
could be 'killed' by a weapon bearing fighter who merely needed to
shout out "you're dead m'lord!".  The other type wore full armor,
carried a weapon, and were considered full fighters with all the rights
and considerations which pertain to that.

There were a few variations on missile weapons which they were using.
One was a light bow using normal arrows, the ends of which were padded
with 2 inches of "push" (i.e. normal padding for a thrusting tip), the
shafts were also wrapped in strapping tape as I recall.  Another was a
heavy bow with "golf tube" arrows.  That is, a golf-tube (a 2" diameter
black plastic hollow tube) with a punctured tennis ball at one end &
duct tape'd, and some sort of fletching at the other.  Or maybe a
streamer at the other end.  Another style was the Javelin which was
basically a short golf tube arrow, it DEFINITELY had a streamer on it.
There were also cross-bows, these used Javelin's as the bolts.

When the normal type arrow has been shot it cannot be re-shot until a
marshal inspects it to make sure it hasn't broken inside the padding or
whatever.  This is because a broken arrow shaft can be rather sharp,
and is definitely small enough to slip through the openings in a
helmet.  Any of the golf tube varieties can be reshot as desired.

As for breakage.  They seemed to be running about 10% breakage per
battle.  My sister was shooting and lost something like 2 or 3 arrows
over the entire day.  (2 battles).  Others lost more, others lost
less.  Some of the broken normal arrows you had to inspect closely
before realizing they were broken.  The golf-tubes never broke but when
stepped on with enough force will bend such that they won't fly
straight again.  I've not heard of anyone being hurt from a broken
arrow, but I can imagine situations where it could happen.  Maybe
someone from a kingdom which does archery as a matter of course could
say something?

[As an aside, but safety related.  During the field battle my sister
 accidently shot one of the heralds who were serving as marshal
 duty in the center of the field.  He didn't have any armor on,
 and her shot landed right and properly squarely on the side of
 his head just below the temple.  This was one of those "normal"
 arrows, not a golf tube.  His reaction was basically just a shake
 of the head, maybe a quick look around, it didn't appear to hurt
 him at all.  After the battle while we were wandering about we
 happened upon him and there was no anger and he acted as if he
 hadn't been hurt at all.  Another of the heralds told us that
 they appreciated that shot -- it helped to remind them of the
 stuff that's flying around out there.

 Me?  I keep trying to get her to (when she registers a name) add
 something like 'herald-killer' on the end :-) ... and *I*'m a
 herald-in-training even!]

The biggest problem with combat archery is that the regular fighters
really hate being killed that way.  Some simply refuse to take arrow
blows.  Others bitch and complain.  Some like it.  This is understandable,
after all "period" fighters bitched and complained about missile
weapons too!  I think it adds an interesting new dimension to the
strategies of battle.  But on the other hand understand the disappointment
of fighters who get killed before they can get into the fighting.
It also allows participation by a lot of people who would otherwise
not be in the battles.  And I don't mean just people who don't want
to get themselves in shape and go to all the trouble of buying
and/or making full armor.

One valid complaint is that a lot of the archers are fairly
inexperienced with their weapons, leading to random shots.  [Maybe
that's why my sister hit that herald?  I really do not know how
experienced she is with bows.  I do know she had been practicing
weekly.]  Perhaps requiring some sort of authorization in bows before
being allowed on the field is in order?  Perhaps requiring
participation in IKAC shoots, with some minimum scores there as the
entrance requirement to combat archery?

I mean people like me.  My legs were almost crushed about 5 years ago
and have never fully healed.  If I start doing something which involves
a lot of running/jumping/etc [stuff common while fighting] then my legs
start hurting real bad.  They also let me know about weather changes
quite nicely.  In other words, I cannot get into fighting because of
this, nor dancing (!).  But I would really like to get into both.  Now,
if I could be a combat archer ... But not only does my kingdom not allow
it [tho' we *are* close enough to Meridies to go to their events here]
but I've lost interest in archery, largely because I wouldn't be able
to go on the field but also difficulty in finding time & place to
practice archery.

There has been created a trophy to be given to the kingdom with

Subject: Cheap and light armor

For a number of years, I fought in what one lady termed "Pictish Fencer 
Armor".  I took a rectangular piece of soft leather, cut a hole for the head 
in the middle and riveted oak slats vertically around it.  The slats should 
DEFINITELY be hardwood like oak or maple.  Do not use pine or composite 
materials like plywood.  They should also be 1/2" thick.    I spaced them with 
an inch space in between, added straps on the side to tighten it up , and 
voila.  These days you need to add riveted leather straps on the shoulders, 
with an extra 4 inches hanging down off the shoulder.  Try using multiple 
stacked thinner strips rather than 1 thicker strip.  The slats should not be 
longer than your hip joint, nor should they protrude higher than your 
shoulder.  

I found that this armor protected me surprisingly well.  I never worried about 
taking fully prepped halbard blows by (now) Duke Sir Vissevald.  

Occasionally a slat will give up the ghost. Having an extra supply of
predrilled slats available is a good idea, not to mention a 5 lb hammer, and
some rivets. 


Anyway, for those of you who want some relatively cheap but good armor, there 
it is.  Since it's natural materials, it invoked much less horror in some, but 
it definitely provoked much amusement, and was a great armor to have a 
challenge tourneys.

I can't get to Mike Seller's node, but he asked for people who were interested
in historical alchemy.  I am, although as much from the philosophical point
of view as anything.  I'm making a bit of a concentrated study these days of
the philosophical atmosphere of 15th century (cosimo-lorenzo) Florence, in 
the interest of persona-tuning.  In the process, I have been reading a great
deal of neo-platonism of the period, including some of the interfaces of
philosophy, theology, and magic (hermetic/alchemical) in the intellectual
undercurrents of the time.  I understand that magic is a bit of a taboo in 
the society, as is religion, but it's REALLY HARD to understand some of the
important intellectual issues of the time without delving into these things

In re camping space: As early as the 12th, there shouldn't be a

I was certainly as surprised to find banned combat archery in the

Archers in combat (as well as javilineers and ballista crews) are 
classed as "light fighters".  This means that their minimum armor
requirements are MUCH lower than those of heavy fighters; that 
heavy fighters can kill them by being within a certain range and saying
"you're dead, milord archer" or some such, and that they stay out of the 
range of the fighters' weapons by a good margin (this is easier 
because of the very light armor).  Archers can kill heavy fighters or 
opposing archers by shooting them, but heavy fighters never lay rattan
on them.  In the West, special blunts are fixed to the ends of 
arrows that have had their metal tips cut off, and the shafts are taped
to avoid splintered edges should the arrow break.  All combatants in a
battle involving archery must wear perforated metal screening inside
their helms.  (Fencing masks are not good enough) 
As helm slots and maximum bar width are not to be greater
than 1 inch, and arrow blunts are bigger than that, the screening is
really for protection against broken or splintered arrows.  Bows have 
a maximum pull of 30lbs., and there is an equivalent formula for 
pull of crossbows. (Loryna, can you help here?)  Most fighters I know
consider this arrangement to be very safe.  Fighters whine some about
having to impair their vision with the screening, but I think that 
archers add an air of realism to medieval combat.  

If anyone is interested, I can bibble at great length about period
looks of various missile weapons, their safety, etc.  I will spare you
now, unless there is more interested feedback.

Subject:  Letter of intent

> aletter of intent is still required

No one has ever bothered to explain to me the reasonaning behind this statement.
SO here are my assumptions.(In the abscence of facts ...GUESS!!!)

Poss. reasons for the use of letters of intent.

1. Proof that fighters can write.

    (nope. they could get someone to write it for them,
     beside we all know stick jocks are illiterate)

2. It lets autocrats know how long to schedule fighting time.

   (The bureaucratic mentality strikes again)

3. Its all a conspiracy so that the ruling illuminatae can select from among the
   interested fighters and cripple any that might challenge thier choice as
   king.

     (The Paranoid answer)

4. It seperates the people that want to be king from the people that just want
   fight.

     (And I always thought the King was "the best fighter in the kingdom" and
      not "the best fighter that wants to be king")

5. It is just something else to gossip about.

     (most probable)

Personally I dont think any of these reasons justify the effort of writing a
letter. (except the Paranoid answer of course). Anyone that knows care to give
the real reason and defend it?

Subject: Fighters Letters of Intent

In the Middle, a letter of Intent does several things:
 1) It lets the King know how many Chivalry intend to fight, so
    it will be known how many unbelted fighters can get into the list.
 
 2) It lets the Kingdom Seneschal check the memberships of the fighter
    and consort in advance, and avoid unfortunate incidents like the most
    recent East kingdom unfortunateness.
 
 3) It gives the King, who has the right to exclude *anyone he choses* from
    the list, a chance to tell someone he deems "unsuitable" that s/he
    will not be allowed in the lists, in advance. This prevents nasty,
    embarrassing, uncomfortable public scenes.
 
Michael Litchfield, do you have something against writing? It is communication

Subject: pennsic and middle eastern dance


There are many other students of middle eastern dance at the war.  One
of the Inn, (the Cheshire last year) holds a middle eastern dancing
demonstration to raise money for the Chirgions every year.  So you
should be able to find others to talk to about your arts.

The fact that you are concerned about how your costume will impact on
others makes you more concientious than about 50% of the people at the
war.  The fact that there are so many different styles of clothing
from so many places and times (not to mention costumes such as fur
bikinis, which may be comfortable, but are probably not period) gives
such a carnaval atmosphere to the camp, that I think the Bazaar is
something from the reign of Haroon ar-Rasheed in Baghdad (the mythical
one in the 1001 Nights, not the real one).  Thus maybe you wouldn't be
that out of place at that.  (Note:  when not entertaining their close
family, Arab women wore long robes and veils).  Good luck in finding a
campsite, I cannot help you there.

Others will/have answer/ed the first question.  The answer to the second is, 
we can't and we don't.  We try to duplicate some of the skills of bowmen in 
medieval combat, e.g. the Pensic war point was an attempt to simulate firing 
at an advancing fighter by having the argers fire under time pressure at 
successivly nearer targets.  To further the verisimilitude, these targets are 
often pictures of armed men.  Also I believe at some wars of the roses archers 
could eliminate fighters from one of the battles by hitting a target with the 
fighters device on it from accros the field (i wasn't there, i may have it 
wrong).  The Captain of archers is generaly an equivalent of the heavy lists 
"knight marshal"; he makes sure that the archery in his area is being done 
safely and correctly, etc.   The activities called "combat archery" bear no 
more relation to medieval war than a pillow fight does to a tourney; people do 
it because it is fun.

Subject: re "still another method"

The method M. Brian of Leichester proposes is the best alternate to CT i've 
heard yet, while not actually advocating such a thing i would like to make a 
few comments and modifications:

1. war.
a. fencing.  fencing is not an art of war, it is an art of peace in which 
people get killed (see george silver's entertaining "paradox of defence")  It 
should be counted long with the other late period dilletantish things people 
do like italian ren. dances.
b. archery.  Tests (as opposed to mere competitions) of archery should measure 
speed, accuracy, distance, and endurance.  I do not cossidder royal rounds 
adequate.
c. Rattan.  Skill at rattan fighting actually falls into 3 parts:
	tournemant
	mele
	stratagy.
The first two obviously require some strenght and fighting ability.  The 
third does not, nor need it, nor should it.  It should be possible to devise 
some scenario to test it.  In addition, a nonfighter cn accompany an armed 
mele team (unles medical reasons absolutly preclude it) as a standard bearer. 
 If we could get safe spears back, almost anyone could fight mele.
2. peace
a. written test.  while i agree with the principal behind it, i find the 
thought of putting it into practice somewhat disturbing.  a take-home open 
book exam graded pass/retake and submitted with the letter of intent would, i 
think, be fairer and less obtrusivly modern (unless of course, we are trying 
to recreate medieval chinese custom)
b. arts & scienc pents.  what follows is personal predjudice.  I don't much 
like ASPs as a competition.  the performing arts are notoriously hard to 
judge, all judjing is inheranly subjective (dangerous in a case where the 
crown depends on it), if you rate caligraphy on a scale of one to ten, and 
astronomy on a scale of one to ten, are they really the same scale? etc. 
As recreations of medieval activities i like ASPs even less.  Its a personal 
predjudice, i don't have a better way, or even a different way.

So, with those modifications, i think this is a surprisingly workable method.

malice
malice@isis.mit.edu
although the only changes i would approve in CT is either to allow a champion 
to fight for a king/queen pair and give him the title "warlord" and allow him 
command of the army at pensic, or to allow some rounds of CT to be decided by 
any method agreable to the contestants that isnt too time consuming including 
fensing, mele, chess, casting dice, and tassel kicking.

Subject: The Weird Swedes
Gratia vobis et pax a Deo Patre nostro et Domino Iesu Christo!
Message-ID: <880727005653.17.CONS.ELF@AIDA.ADB.UU.SE>

Milords and ladies,
perhaps you have heard that there is an SCA branch in Sweden? As far
as I know, it's the only group which has been founded by and is
totally made up of people who are not native English-speakers. Our
branch has grown into a Barony and now has about a hundred membe in
five Cantons.

When we decided to start an SCA group in Sweden, we were warned by
a member of BOD that "in many respects, the SCA is hopelessly American".
And sure, our version of the Middle Ages has partially developed
along different lines from mainstream SCA. This has surprised us
because we generally regard Sweden as a very Americanized country.
(There are *three* Mac Donald'hamburger joints in Stockholm.)

We Swedes must seem a bit weird to anu US visitor. One thing they
won't notice is that is's very difficult to be courteous in Swedish.
Our language lacks good equivalents of all those beautiful English
words like Sir, Earl, forsooth, Milady, etc. It's a rather egali-
tarian language, perhaps because Sweden was never feudalized.

But there are other, more visible differences. One particularly
Swedish thing is the lack of competitiveness. In mainstream SCA,
everything seems to be a competition, even Arts & Sciences. Perhaps
we Swedes are strange in feeling that we can have just as much fun
doing things without competing. In the Barony of Nordmark, there
are very few Arts & Sciences competitions. Exhibitions where
people can show their work without having to "beat" others are
more to our taste.

We have learned from America that there is something called "the
Stick Jock problem". This seems very obnoxious, so the Baron has
taken measures to prevent its introduction here. At our annual
spring tournament, the fighters are required to do more than hit
people on the head. The tournament consists of five different
competitions, only one of which is the fighting. Thy other four
vary from one year to another. This year we had six contestants
in full armor standing on the field with needle and thread, trying
to embroider a heart on a piece of fabric. They were also required
to compose a poem, song or story on a theme of the Baron's choice.
This brings other important aspects of chivalry than fighting into
focus.

We have spoken and corresponded with British Dark Agys groups.
They seem to regard the SCA as a "Hollywood" version of the Mid-
dle Ages - worthy of contempt. I'm sure they really don't know
what they're talking about - it's probably just that old Imperial
British pride. But there are those who would scorn us for even
thinking of bringing a plastic cooler to an event. Sadly, some
of us do, but we *are* ashamed of it.

We seem to be much more cool about religion than mainstream SCA.
Quite a few people are adopting clerical personas like monks, etc.
We feel that the Middle Ages aren't complete without the Church.
If you are a rabid atheist who cannot stand to see a religious
ceremony or see a monk make the sign of the cross, you shouldn't
be in the SCA at all because you must *hate* the Middle Ages.
Catholic Christianity and the Middle Ages are as inseparable as
the 20th century and electricity.

There is a strong movement here toward the High European Middle
Ages. We have not a single samurai or any other far-away oriental
personas. As far as I know, there are no personas after 1499 and
hardly any Vikings or ancient Celts. 12th to 15th Century is Us.

So, gentles, as you can see, we are truly weird. But we are grateful
to the BOD for allowing us to be part of this great Society and we
are equally grateful to all those American gentles we meet who are
such models of courtesy and friendliness, and who truly enlighten
our existence whenever they visit us. So please *do* visit us! We
just love to receive people from the Great Western Continent and
share with you our own, weird version of the Dream.

I was up at the Cooper's over the weekend and it was quite wet!

The Lake is at its normal level and, although the swimming hole is down
a bit, the swamps (in the woods) are still pretty damp.

The campsites are not exactly *LUSH*, but it doesn't appear that there
should be too much trouble with dry conditions...this doesn't imply that
peopl should come unprepared to be careful, but if the current trend of
occasional showers holds for awhile it may be a pretty normal war
(at least as far as the weather is concerned.)

I recently posted an article on an alternative to crown tournies which was also
published in AESTEL, the newsletter for the Western Region of the East Kingdom.
In the interests of fair play, I am now posting a rebuttal that it may have a
circulation as wide as the original article.		- Dagonell
 
		STILL ANOTHER WAY TO HOLD CROWN / CORONET TOURNEY
			     BY BRIAN OF LEICHESTER
 
	In the July AESTEL, Lord Dagonell suggested a "grand prix" style of 
holding  a Crown / Coronet tournament.  I sorely disagree with his suggestion
on two grounds:
 
1.)  The proposed system encourages the possibility of a Barony or Shire 
holding more events in this short span in order to "stack the deck" in favor
of one of their own fighters.  More "local" events can permit a fighter and
his/her consort to score as many as twelve points (assuming ONE event a month
in a given locale).  Now, that's a considerable advantage!
 
2.) In as much as one might try to keep totals a secret, competitors WILL know
where they stand in relation to one another!  Word does get around (e.g. - 
AESTEL and local newsletters, close friends in other shires and baronies, etc.).
Consequently, should there be ONE dominating couple, the Crown / Coronet Tourney
may be a moot point.  Everyone shall know who will be invested BEFORE the 
Tourney starts, because word will have gotten around as to where prospective
couples stand!  Where's all the excitement in that?
 
	Enough for my criticisms!  Let me suggest an alternative!
 
	As I see it, fighters and consorts should be equally versed in the 
Arts of WAR (Rattan, Fencing, and Archery) AND the Arts of Peace (the tra-
ditional A & S competitions).  Further, this tourney should be held as a
SINGLE event, which would be held over a single weekend.  
 
	To achieve an equal weight between "War" and "Peace", one could utilize
the "Ordinal" system for the scoring of Figure Skating.  According to this
system, competitors are ranked by how well they do in each event.  Each portion
is weighted as a percentage of the whole competition (e.g. Compulsory Figures
= 30%, Short Program = 20%, Long Program = 50%).  These partial scores
("Ordinals") are then added up.  The score that is closest to 1.00 is the 
winner.
 
	Should this system be used, the portions might be weighted as follows:
 
WAR (50%)
---------
 
RATTAN (25%):	Presently the only way that the Crown / Coronet is determined
		in the East.  As such, it should receive the most weight in
		scoring the Arts of War.
 
ARCHERY (15%):	The ONLY Art of War where there is NO "head to head" 
		competition.  As such, this is the one Art of War where
		fighters and consorts are on an equal footing.
 
FENCING (10%):	The most recent of the Arts of War to have an Order established.
		Also, not all who fight in the rattan lists fence.
 
PEACE (50%)
-----------
 
WRITTEN TEST (30%):  This exam would test their knowledge of :
		
		Kingdom Law and Corpora (12%) : A ruler and consort should
		know the laws of the realm and of the Society.
	
		Arts and Sciences (18%) : Ruler and consort should be know-
		ledgeable of the arts and sciences that thrive within their
		realm.
 
ARTS AND SCIENCES PENTATHLON (20%) : A ruler and consort should be skilled
		in the arts and sciences.  After all, it is a fact that all
		of the Hapsbourgs were taught carpentry.  Also, there are
		more than a few fighters in the East who can do various arts
		and sciences.
 
ESTABLISHING RANKINGS:
----------------------
 
WAR: 	1) For Rattan and Fencing, if only ONE person of a competing couple
	fights, then the order that this person finishes in is the basis for
	the "ordinal".  When both compete in the lists, the ordinal would
	be the higher of the two orders of finish.  (They would fight for 
	each other.)
 
	Of course, this would mean that there would be "Consolation Fights"
	to clear up the rankings from third to last place.  In other words,
	the eliminated would fight a "third" elimination.
 
	2) Archery ordinals would be based on the score in a Royal Round.
	As with Rattan and Fencing, when BOTH persons in a couple compete,
	the higher score counts.
 
PEACE:	1) For the written test, ALL couples participate!  Ordinals are
	determined by the COMBINED score of the couples on each section.
 
	2) For the pentathlon, couples would submit entries in several
	categories.  Entries would be scored as to their : documentation,
	authenticity, originality, etc. (as in the Ice Dragon Arts Pentathlon).
	Ordinaries would be based on the average score of all of a given 
	couple's entries.
 
	The couple whose ordinals are lowest would be invested during the
	feast at the end of the Tourney.
 
ADVANTAGES:
-----------
 
1) This type of tournament retains the one "advantage" stated in Lord
Dagonell's article: that it favors a combined artist / fighter.
 
2) In contrast to Lord Dagonell's system, the Crown / Coronet Tourney
would be a SINGLE EVENT!!!  This minimizes paperwork.
 
3) It gives the consort some importance.  It makes winning the Tournament
a "team effort".  After all, the written exam would count for 30% of the
tournament.  One "brain" and one "ditz" as a couple would not fair well.
 
DISADVANTAGES:
--------------
 
1) As with Lord Dagonell's system, Kingdom Law would have to be changed.
 
2) Also, this system stands to be opposed by those not wanting to abandon
the present one day "All or Nothing Round" in the rattan lists.
 
WHAT STAYS THE SAME:
--------------------
 
1) Letter of Intent would still be required!
 
AS with Lord Dagonell's article, this is also an intellectual exercise, which
is offered to stimulate discussion as a post-revel topic.  This presently,
is NOT a proposal for consideration at CURIA.  I too, welcome feedback /
commentary on this article.  Please address these to :

In response I will attempt to inform you of the state of archery 
in the Middle Kingdom and our neighboring Kingdoms.  Firstly, the
Midrealm has no combat archery.  We do not allow it at all.  Of 
course, there are exceptional events and training for inter King-
dom wars, so some is done.  We have also found it advantageous to 
use archers to build poriferal vision in fighters.  This is 
possible and it does work.  

Meridies, our fellow Kingdom to the south, allows the usage of 
wooden arrows with a large (1+1/4") soft but firm tip on them for
combat archery.  This is good as far as it goes, but some accidents 
have happened.  Most were annoyances, but some were very close calls
to a real difficulty.  The maximum poundage on their bows was 30 
lbs.  As far as I could tell in my battles with them, the marshals
need to play a larger role in telling a fighter that they are dead.
You cannot feel the arrow strike you through good armor.  This can
result in angry fighters, but usally dosen't.

Atlantia, to the east of the Middle Kingdom, has an alternate 
archery.  They use the tubes inserted into golfing bags to seperate 
the clubs for archery.  Inserted into the front of the tube is a piece
of something to hold the shape of the tube while providing padding,
and the back is crimped together to hold the bowstring.  Useful range 
is limited, and carrying more than a few clumsy, but these are very 
safe.  I have seen these used in a castle seige at Giant's Dance in 
Atlantia when I was there with His Majesty of the Middle Kingdom, 
Corwin, and at close range watched some of the greats "knocked off"
by archery (His grace, Duke Micheal of Boorshaven for one).  At the 
range of 20 yards or less, very effective.  Unfortunately, not very 
period looking or even stylish, but again, very safe.

In these two alternate views of combat archery, I hope to have given
some information to one and all.  If you have any questions, talk to
you respective Kingdom archery marshal.  This person should only be a 
far speaker away, or drop me a line.

Subject: pennsic

Greetings, Milords and Ladies.

This year, I will be the first person arriving for my barony, and so will have
to figure out where we (Barony of Wurm Wald) will be camping.  I will be 
arriving (hopefully) on the evening of Friday, the 12 of August.  By that time,
will there be large plots of land available still?  I have heard that people
get there VERY early and most of the good stuff is gone fast.  There will be
a goodly number of us and we would all like to camp together without knocking
elbows at every turn.  Since this will be my first pennsic, I am not quite sure
about how to get space other than to show up at the troll/trollop booth and 
inquire.  If anyone has any suggestions, they will be greatly appreciated.

Also, as I am a student of middle eastern dance, what opportunities are there
to watch/perform?  Are people touchy about dancers wearing period outfits, or
do they care?  (I mean the majority of people, I know everyone has different 
opinions.) I am working on a gawazi dress, but I doubt I will have it done by
pennsic, and I would definitely like the opportunity to perform.  :-)

While mosquitoes look for many substances in their search for food, it is
NOT the CO2 which deet makes them less sensitive to, but the lactic acid.

(My source: Science News, Vol. 134, No. 3, p. 37, 16 July 1988, in a story
reporting on papers presented at the International Congress of Entomology
in Vancouver).

The general idea of Lord Sean's diagnosis of the Avon Skin-so-Soft
moisturizer's action may still be valid: perhaps the moisturizer reacts
with the mosquito's antennae in a manner similar to that of deet; or
perhaps it interferes in some way with the body's emission of lactic acid
molecules (but not necessarily CO2).  I'm not an expert in this field,
though I support the dissemination of scientific fact: I'll let the biochem
and/or marketing types worry about whether Avon can put Cutters or Muskol
out of business...

 I have learned that I am being "tentatively" sent to Indianapolis (and
possibly Cleveland) on August 23rd-24th.
 As this will be my first time in those regions, I would like to know of any
chance to make contact with Society folk or activities at the time. Anyone
advising please send mail.

 I remain,etc.,

Two things to do that are cheap, and highly effective for keeping insects
away:

1. Swollow a clove (don't chew!) of garlic in the morning, and one at night.
It doesn't make your breath or body smell (to people) but it'll keep a lot
of bugs away.  If you have pets, put garlic powder on their food -- it
works pretty well against fleas, and some ticks.

2. Don't eat sugary foods or sweets.  Mosquitoes seem to be able to find
people that are sucking down the sucrose.

These have both worked for me for years -- many a camping trip I didn't
have to spray once for bugs, while my friends got eaten alive....

Message-Id: <1988Jul19.213430.215@mntgfx.mentor.com>

So, after nearly five years (FIVE YEARS?!) of dipping my toes in the waters
of the Society, I'm about to embark on my first real camping-type event at 
our local Ducal War -- just as soon as I get back from my rather mundane 
vacation.  As such, I'd like to gather as many opinions and pointers for 
this type of thing as possible.  My daughter (7) and I are both up for 
acting in period for the whole time, and my Lady wife is being cheerfully 
agreeable about the whole thing, as is her way, though she is not so much 
into it.  Yet.  We have a good assortment of modern (I really do prefer 
that word to 'mundane', no matter what folks say about there being no 
pejorative connotations) camping gear, and a few generic period type 
clothes (there will, to my knowledge, be no court or formal event during
the war), but I would like to find out what if anything we are lacking,
either in the way of baggage or etiquette.

For example, I know that many folks hereabouts do not have pavilions, but
in general, are there any do's and don't's about using a modern tent at
such an event?  I realize that such attitudes are likely to be somewhat
geographically-bound, but I'd like to hear it anyway.  And then there's...

David Herron writes:

Is there anything wrong with using a Coleman, but just turning it down a 
bit to a somewhat mellower glow?  I find that this is nice anyway, since 
I don't like feeling like I have a streetlamp outside my tent.  Candles
are a safety hazard, especially around children.  Or some fighters, which
may come to the same thing. :-)

I will, of course, endeavor to keep my cooler and other modernisms out of
plain sight as much as possible -- I too have a little trouble keeping my
mind back where it ought to be if I'm tripping over cars and boom-boxes.
Still, I refuse to put myself or my family through too much pain and 
suffering just in the name of the Dream or whatever.  And on that note, 
am I going to incur a lot of gentles' wrath (or even sidelong glances) 
if I quietly fire up my Coleman stove in the morning for breakfast?  Yes
I know cooking over a fire is more in-period, and even more fun, but there
has to be a balance between re-creation and expediency someplace.

> <---- David Herron -- The E-Mail guy                   <david@ms.uky.edu>

I have my period drinking vessels, hopefully enough generic period dress to
get by (the Good Stuff will have to wait until my Lady gets through her
backlog of sewing -- she is quite good, but very busy), and even the first
real glimmerings of a persona.  And of course my armor, though I probably 
won't be fighting in the War.  

What else do I/we need?  Any advice, opinions, or general kibitzing would
be appreciated.  Please note that I am going on vacation tomorrow, so e-mail
would be more likely to reach me than posting.  I will answer any and all
e-mail that looks like it wants an answer, and I never get enough :-).
Thanks in advance.

I am curious as to how you handle fighting between knights and
archers?  In 1415 the French lost 5000 nobles killed and 1000
captured versus the English 13 nobles and 100 yeomen killed at
Agincourt.  I'm asking this because there has been at least one 
posting signed 'Captain of the Archers'.  How do you make the 
combat look real but still keep it safe?

	What do you mean here?   If someone has weapon and armor 
designed correctly for his or herself then one will have an advantage.
This was true in period as much as today.  I do not think that the 
above is true.  Given that the combatants are of equal skill there are
still a number of factors that come into consideration, one of which is
how much emphasis the individuals place on winning.  Many other factors;
training, brains, conditioning, conditions...., all contribute to the 
outcome.  Equipment, as it is today, is a minor factor.  One might go
so far as to say a *very* minor factor.

	And there are times when using mundane materials is fair and
allowance of thier use is chivalrous.  There are individuals whose
constitution does not allow them to fight as effectively as those of
us more physically blessed.  As a fighter who wears 50-60 pounds of 
armor not including a 10 gauge helm, I don't mind it.  I helps to 
make up for the fact that I'm a musclebound ape.

	I think you will find some rule exist in all Kingdoms concerning
shield wieght, but that in several it is vague to the point of being
incomprehensable.  Ansteora had such a rule.  It read something of the 
nature: "Shields must be made of appropriate materials so as to be
comparable to period shields." or something of that nature.  Very vague.

Well... I have tried this wonderfull oil in the worst of places:             
        in an infested Tick/Flea region and house in Maryland... (where the  
        ticks are literally killers)                                         
                                                                             
It worked wonders... but I helped bu upping my vit. B intake and eating lots 
of garlic...                                                                 
                                                                             
As one who is heavily-bearded, I find that parasites frequently try to crawl 
through my beard to that tender-blood-ridden skin unerneith... moreover, I   
do not apply deep-woods or any other insect repellant to hair...             
                                                                             
The sheiks "oil" their beards and hair to both repel insects (if they use the
correct oil) and to keep lice from laying eggs on the hair (an get a good    
hold onto the hair to jump...)                                               
                                                                             
I forgot which oil the sheiks used... but used skin-so-soft bath oil DIRECTLY
on by hair-and-beard... this worked GREAT!  It did not smell bad... no bugs  
at all tried to invade these areas... and it moisturized my badly wind-and-sun
dried hair!

Now who do we know who is an Avon dealer?

Ice and groceries may be obtained on site, at the Cooper's Store.  They 
stock a very nice fruit and veggies stand, and the Store itself carries such
essentials as milk, soda, ice cream (need my daily Klondike fix! :-), 
insect repellant, tentstakes, and other things.  For other foodstuffs, both
New Castle and Butler are realativly close by (within 10-20 miles), and there
are grocery, department, and package (liquor) stores in both towns.
  As to laundry, there is a small coin laundry on site in a room in the Barn.
It's often crowded.  
  Parties?  Well, Horde camp often has a few, and many other camps usually
have them also.

At the two Pennsics I've attended, I seem to recall the An Tir nobility, at
least at War Court Saturday eve.  I know for certain that HRM Brian Thornbird,
King of Caid, will be there, as will his Lady Queen.  Royalty from most of the

Okey-doke.  The logical place to look, then, is... the net!

Is anyone out there interested in either the study or (preferably) recreating 
the architecture of circa 1250-1300?  In some of the most dramatic cases this 
entails things like cathedrals and castles, though this is by no means the 
end of it (I could, however, probably be prodded into a long "talk & nod" 
with anyone about the various principles behind the discovery and use of
flying buttresses :-) ).

And how about alchemy?  No, not like in Macbeth, but as it "really" happened.
Or as they *say* it really happened, which is not at all the same thing, but
is much more fun to explore.   I had a chemistry teacher who said that one 
of the main reasons students are all taught to use "lab notebooks" today is 
that many alchemists would promise to let one of their collegues in on their 
Secrets by letting them borrow their journals.  Of course the journals were
so obfuscated that no one could make heads or tails of what was written...
which was, according to my teacher, entirely the point.  And of course, the
tradition continues. :-)

Well, I have other interests too, some more prosaic like fighting or stained
glass, and others a little more adventurous like period sailing, but I'll 
leave those for another time.

So, is anyone interested in any of these things?  It can't just be me!


P.S.  I'm going on Vacation tomorrow for a week and a half (hurrah) so I 
will probably miss anything that's posted, but I promise to answer any and

>I was surprised to see someone sad at the anachronism of a

Oops. Maybe it was a mistake to mention the open bascinet. I didn't
mean it that way. There is certainly nothing wrong with safety. But
the way fighters talk among themselves, the reason for an open bas-
cinet with grill is *not* a desire to combine early period armor
with list legality, but rather that it gives you a better view and
thus an advantage. I personally think these helms are ugly and make
the fighter look like a misplaced baseball player. But I quite
agree that carpet armor with plastic knee caps is *worse*.

I certainly want to use a modern shower and toilet at tourneys,
and I do use an electric drill when I make armor. Total authen-
ticity is impossible and not even desirable since - as Coranna
rightly points out - we want to have a good time, too. An event
should be a place where you don't *see* any cars, digital watches,
plastic bags and other mundane objects. But it's good that the
20th century is available on the other side of the hill.

What I would question is the attitude toward fighting where
*winning* becomes more important than authenticity. I don't think
that it's intrinsically wrong to use modern materials like foam
padding, as long as you make some effort to hide them. But you
should not replace steel with plastic if steel is safe and avail-
able. You shouldn't use modern materials because you think they
give you an advantage over period armor. How can you aspire to
be a medieval knight when you are consciously preferring modern
technology to period equipment? This is what I mean by "treating
SCA fighting as a sport".

For illustration, let's consider Japanese Budo. Some few people
who do Budo are actually playing at being Samurai. They follow
old styles and try to learn how Samurai thought and acted. But
the vast majority really don't care much about Samurai. They
may be aware of the historic background, but that is not why
they are taking karate or whatever. The important thing is to
become good at the sport and win fights. Thus, most Budo styles
have become modern sports. And that's OK with me. But the same
thing is happening to the European medieval fighting in the SCA.
And here, it's contrary to the whole idea on which the Society
was founded. The Middle Ages is not simply the historic back-
ground to what we are doing, it *is* what we are doing.

I believe that period equipment should be a serious conside-
ration for knighthood; a guy who wears a full 30 kilo suit of
chainmail may not win many fights when opposed by people who
wear light plastic armor covered with nice-looking surcotes.
But who is more worthy of honor? Who follows best the ideals
of the Society? The answer is obvious to me.

So, it's all more a matter of the mentality than of the
materials per se. It was never my intention to demand that
certain equipment should be outlawed. I just want to see a
more serious attempt at creating a Middle Ages that - with
a little help of the imagination - is believable. The right
mentality will make you rather abstain from drink than use
a plastic horn. And if you can't survive an event without a
can of Coke hidden in your pouch, why bother to go at all?

And nay, milord Kwellend Njal, my name is not "Bill the Crow".

Unto Lady Elizabeth Braidwood (and anyone else who may care),

-- I wouldn't worry too much about groceries and ice, so long as they will
   have a car. The Coopers normally have ice available in great store on site
   as well as a few basic groceries (fruits & stuffs). Also, the treasure
   halls of King Valu are just a tad down the road, where one can obtain
   nearly anything, so long as you can deal with large numbers of mundanes
   whispering, "It's *them* again; is it August already?". (The locals
   like us, but we do confuse them no end).

-- The best insect repellent that I've encountered is Avon's Skin-So-Soft
   moisturizer. Seriously. No one's yet figured out *why* it works so well
   as an insect repellent, but it seems to work as well as anything but
   really high-potency Deet compounds, and doesn't smell half as bad.
   (Smells a little *odd* for a period event, but these are the sacrifices
   we make for comfort). Can't be bought in stores -- try to contact your
   local Avon representative. We've confirmed that the lotion works pretty
   well, and we're going to try out the bath oil this Pennsic.

In service to the Society (and playing with the minds of Butler County),

you check out AIKIDO.This art is completly defensive,nonviolent.
It doesn't might a big deal about the rank ,color of your belt
(it's either white or back),50%of the time is devoted to responding 
to a throw to learn how to fall.The object is to harmonize your physical and 
mental processes with your attacker. The founder of AKIDO is quoted as 
saying "the object in life should not so much be to defeat your 
enemies , but to have no enemies ."
	The New England headquarters is in Cambridege at 2000 Mass

Aikido is non-profit. To be invincible on the field of honor requires
inner strength derived from strength of spirit, not from "competition".

Your skin exudes carbon dioxide. This is how bugs find you. DEET works by
interfering with the bugs' CO2 detection system, fooling them into thinking
that there is a lower CO2 content near your skin. That might be what the
Avon product is doing.

I'm glad to hear of this, because DEET products smell strongly, are
expensive, and worst of all, they attack plastic unmercifully. Be really
careful about handling plastic items after applying DEET.

Oops. Maybe it was a mistake to mention the open bascinet. I didn't
mean it that way. There is certainly nothing wrong with safety. But
the way fighters talk among themselves, the reason for an open bas-
cinet with grill is *not* a desire to combine early period armor
with list legality, but rather that it gives you a better view and
thus an advantage. I personally think these helms are ugly and make
the fighter look like a misplaced baseball player. But I quite
agree that carpet armor with plastic knee caps is *worse*.

I certainly want to use a modern shower and toilet at tourneys,
and I do use an electric drill when I make armor. Total authen-
ticity is impossible and not even desirable since - as Coranna
rightly points out - we want to have a good time, too. An event
should be a place where you don't *see* any cars, digital watches,
plastic bags and other mundane objects. But it's good that the
20th century is available on the other side of the hill.

What I would question is the attitude toward fighting where
*winning* becomes more important than authenticity. I don't think
that it's intrinsically wrong to use modern materials like foam
padding, as long as you make some effort to hide them. But you
should not replace steel with plastic if steel is safe and avail-
able. You shouldn't use modern materials because you think they
give you an advantage over period armor. How can you aspire to
be a medieval knight when you are consciously preferring modern
technology to period equipment? This is what I mean by "treating
SCA fighting as a sport".

For illustration, let's consider Japanese Budo. Some few people
who do Budo are actually playing at being Samurai. They follow
old styles and try to learn how Samurai thought and acted. But
the vast majority really don't care much about Samurai. They
may be aware of the historic background, but that is not why
they are taking karate or whatever. The important thing is to
become good at the sport and win fights. Thus, most Budo styles
have become modern sports. And that's OK with me. But the same

As I write these words, it has been raining here in Western
Pennsylvania for nearly two solid days.  It is supposed to continue
raining through tomorrow.  Of course, there is no guarantee that the
drought will actually end; we could have another month without rain,
which would mean that by Pennsic things will be really dry again.
Better to plan on bringing the extra water jugs, extra coolers and new

I would like a definition of "sport".  How does it differ from a martial art?
In a way, this seems to have become a matter of semantics.  I dropped out of a
particular martial art school because I found their style too competitive. 
The self improvement concepts were there, but cloaked in enough machismo to
make it personally distasteful.

Here are some more questions:

What did occur at medieval tournaments?  At whatever time period.  Do our
tournaments bear any likeness to them?

I realize that Society combat contains the elements of honor and chivalry.
I, too, find the "win at any and all cost" attitude distasteful but isn't
the desire to win, particularly in the most fair and chivalric manner, the 
point of our combat?  We work on our skills at fighter practices.  Are the
fighting techniques being taught (and the new ones being developed as time goes
by) authentic?  In the months before a crown tourney, I see a lot of training
going on.  I seriously doubt that Trimaris is unique in this.

A tournament is a competition whether you fight for honor, love, or a really
nifty sword.  If you want to win, again for whatever reasons, you've got to
work for it before hand.

It appears that our problem is one of education.  The gentles training new
fighters need to teach them what they are fighting for as well as how to
fight.  Granted, they may not listen which becomes another problem all
together!  :-)

Fighting is the most important thing in the society?
If this is so I don't really want to be involved.
I admit this may seem like an over reaction but If fighting, going out and
hitting someone in steel jamies with a piece of rattan is The most important
thing in the society I can find better things to do with my time.
   I first became involved with the society because I was not happy with the
world. I saw some people in a park acting in a manner that felt closer to what I
believed was right. THEY WERE NOT FIGHTING!!!! They were treating each other
with curtousey and politeness, there were a few people talking about "4 in 1, 14
gauge" vs. "6 in 1, i6 gauge", that was the closest anyone there came to
fighting.
   My big problem with fighting is that often (not always) it dissembles to guys
with an attitude of " well you don't fight *sneer* ". I can hear people now
going well that is just a few bad apples, but I have seen that in almost every
kingdom I have been in and on and off for 8 years.
    The most important thing in this thing...our society, is the harkening back
to a time in which we believe people treated each other better, almost like
humans instead of things. Fighting can be good, and some of the more impressive
things I have seen have been on the field, but it is also the source of a lot of
crap. We are the Society for Creative Anachronism...not the Rattan Fencing
League, don't limit our range of actions or even subjugate them to fighting.

I have always thought of SCA fighting as a resurrection of the tournament,
either in its William Marshall form or as it existed about 1400 - helmets
with barred visors, even more complicated scoring systems, etc.  For Marshall
the motivation was initially profit, of course.  

What is the "best" equipment?  I'm really not sure that the "best" equipment
determines much.  The most important factors are training and basic 
physical skills, in that order, I think.  Armor and weapons come third at
best.

At the Midrealm Crown Tourney won by Alen I (AS XII(?) ) then Earl Master
Moonwulf and Duke Sir Finnvar held the field against all comers.  There were
14 (fourteen).  Finnvar found one of the holes in the field and hurt an
ankle almost immediately after that melee started, and Moonwulf had to 
take on all 14 at once - which he did.  

My favorite battle was in the Rivenstar-Wurmwald War, in which Rivenstar
fielded 16 (all but one fighting Florentine) and Wurmwald fielded 24 (about
16 sword and shield).  Their general Finn immediately took them into the trees
where they laagered up.  Wulf divided the 16 into 8 for banner defence and 8 for
a forward skirmish line.  Finn, not being a fool, refused to attack the 8 and
Wulf eventually began grandstanding alone.  After about 10 minutes of this the
Wurmwald forces attacked; we lost 1 killed, one wounded and only 1 Wurmwald
fighter made it through to the banner guard).

Ah, the good old days....

i dissagree strongly.

The Society is a very loose, broadly spread culture.  It continues to exist 
because, in spite of an incredible diversity of interests and activities, its 
members manage somehow to find a consensus of what its culture is.
We all wear "medieval clothes," but these range from true medieval through 
high rennaissance and elizabethen to cavalier; while most of us claim to be 
european, some are islamic, some japanese or chinese.  We occasionally welcome 
vistors from other cultures, such as the Twochucks.
We have a college of heralds which prevents the most outrageously o.o.p. of 
names and devices from being official, although not from being used.
We have a corporate structure and bod whose bylaws prevent any group from 
going wildly out of the bounds of what other groups are doing, but which has 
little or nothing to do with the "events" where our culture is maintained, 
reinforced, and spread to new people.
Not all groups cook medievaly.
Not all groups dance, and among those who do the overlap of dance repertoirs 
is distressingly small.
Not all groups fence.
Needle work, a widespread activity, is not of a nature to unify large groups.
We have a system of awards which is clumsy, slow to reward many, and 
inaccurate, if not unfair in many cases.

How then, do we know who we are and what we are trying to recreate?

Because in the back of nearly everyones mind, inextricably entwined with the 
medieval, is the image of the knight in shining armor, entering the lists to 
fight for love and honor.

chivalry.

fighters.

However unfair it seems to dancers and embroiderers who want to be king too, 
however manifestly unfit many fighters are for such responisbility, the heavy 
list is what holds our culture together and makes us *the* society and not a 
just a widely scattered set of special interest groups.

I agree with William de Corbie, that SCA fighting should not be 
considered a sport.  It is not.  It should be considered a martial
art.

Martial arts, if they are taught properly, teach an attitude as well
as the fighting.  The attitude that goes along with SCA fighting
is courtesy and chivalry.

Unfortunately, it appears that this portion of teaching fighting
is being neglected.  SCA fighting should be taught with the attitude
that fighting to the best of your ability, fighting chivalrously
and courteously, fighting for the greater honor of your consort is
more important than winning.  This attitude should be drilled into
fighters just as much as the proper technique for a rising snap.

This attitude is also the responsibility of the consort.  It is
up to the consort to let their fighter know that they are proud of
them whether they win or lose.  Remember, when a fighter carries
your favor, they carry your honor.  It is your responsibility
to ensure that your fighter is chivalrous and courteous on the 
field just as much as it the fighter's responsiblity.

I am encouraged by Njall's comment that he truly enjoyed presenting
his prizes to his lady.  I would also like to see more emphasis on
the honor of the consort being a main reason to go out and fight.
This is not to say that if one fighter is defeated by another that
this implies less honor to one consort over the other.  If the
fighters did their best and fought chivalrously and courteously, then
there is no less honor to the consort of the loser than the winner.

If we all could teach and encourage this kind of attitude on the 
field, I think alot of the problems of blow counting and questionable 
practices on the field would be solved.  (It is the Field of Honor, 
isn't it?).

I just started reading this newsgroup, but I could not resist writing
a response to this posting.

I missed the original posting but I think I got the general gist of it.
It appears that the issues here are 1) how to tell when someone
is hitting too hard and/or 2) how to tell when someone is counting too
hard.

In my opinion, neither of these problems can be solved by legislation
or mechanical devices.  It is up to the two people in the armor to
deal with it, with help from the marshals on the field and, possibly,
the royalty watching the tournament.

If someone is consistently had either of the above problems, word 
generally gets around and that person can be talked to.  It is
only if the person is unreasonable and refuses to adjust their
fighting methods that any drastic action need be taken.  These
kinds of cases are rare enough that they should be handled 
individually. 

Of course, this kind of system has problems.  People who are well
known and well liked are less likely to be seen to have a problem
that someone who is new and/or not well liked.  But, I like
this solution better that some kind of mechanical device that will
determine the strength of the blow, or worse, the marshals telling
a fighter whether the blow was hard enough.

It all boils down to, "You should fight in a chivalrous manner".  With
chivalrous being a set of conventions that is well known.  Anyone
with problems can be assumed to maybe not know the conventions.  They 
should be informed of them in a chivalrous and courteous manner until
they have proved to be a consistent problem.

P.S.  A person who is seen to get their armor dented by a sword blow
and does not take it may actually not feel it.  A lot of a blows
energy can be lost denting armor with nothing left for the fighter
to feel.  I know, it has happened to me with a 1/2 inch dent in
my helm that I felt like a love tap ( :-) ).

	Yes.  It is reasuring that names are in some way distinct.  With
the way we tend to move around calling yourself John of Foobar just isn't 
enough today, though in period it would most likely have been.

	Could you explain what you mean here?  What would be some "levels
of protection"?

	I would think that it would be given the same protection as any other,
with perhaps one exception: a member of a household might want to note the
association in his or her name, and should be allowed to, provided that 
he or she really *is* a member of the household.


>What about an order name?  

	Can you explain how these might warrent more or less protection?  THat
would help us to form an opinion.

	Same.

 
>If we register names, should we require a minimum level of authenticity?  

	Definately.


>What do you think that level should be?  

	Somewhat less stringent than I understand it to be now.  I think that
if someone has done the work researching a language and time to the point that
a competent arguement can be (and has been) made for a name, then it should be
allowed.

	An example:  my name as it is should pass, Kwellend is Old English,
Njal and Kollskeggsson are both well documented Norse names.  It seems
reasonable to me, given the state of affairs that existed in parts of 
England in the 10th and 11th century, that the construction Kwellend-Njal
could have occured (Or indeed most English adjective-Norse name combinations).
From the period approx. 800AD on there was substantial interaction between
the two languages in the region of Northumbria and East Anglia, and the idea
of a Norseman picking up an English kenning does seem reasonable.  But under
the current rules of submission this would not pass, mixing the two languages 
in one construction is not legal, while submitting them as two separate words
in one name should pass.  Basically almost any attempt make names more period
in the use of original languages should be encouraged, as this adds signifi-
cantly to the atmosphere of the society.

	Yes, because there are more people to do the research, and these 
are the names people are more likely to see, (moreso than an individual's
name) and so should exibit a higher standard of authenticity.

Lately, word has trickled to me that concerns all gentles who
will be attending the upcoming Pennsic War. The drought has
apparently hit Pennsylvania so hard that the state may soon
declare a complete ban on outdoor burning. This would probably
not affect enclosed lanterns or fires in "braziers" (hibachi
grill or enclosed lanterns) but campfires and probably
non-enclosed lighting such as Tiki torches would not be allowed.

Just passing the (not good) word.

As fate would have it there are two places to buy fencing equipment
within 3 hours of Bowmans Rest.  They are 

Santelli Fencing Equipment
465 South Dean St
Englewood, NJ 

and 

Blade Fencing Equipment
New York, NY.   

They are both in the local phone books.  

One thing to note though.  If you buy from Santelli they will sell you 
blades threaded in 12-24.  The international standard is 6mm-1.  You have 
to specify 6mm thread if you want compatibility.


/S*

ps.  This is one case where I must admit to not being an unbiased customer
of both.  They both; however, have a good line of merchandise.

As I had hoped, the names I was missing in the tale of Earl Sir Sebastian
Nightwind's "chivalry against the world" battle have been filled in by
several gentles on the net who attended.  In addition to Master Kobayashi's
addition of Turlough O'Rourke  as the fighter who succeeded in injuring
Sebastian,  I should add that Jan Rafiel Shkoder was Sebastian's squire whom
Sebastian fought just before Turlough.  Now the tale is complete and the glory
duly distributed I hope.

From what I have managed to dig up (not much, and as with most everything
Scottish, highly unreliable), both pleating styles, pleat-to-stripe and
pleat-to-sett, were used, if even that much attention was paid to the
pleating. One friend claims that just pleating it with hand's-width (or so)
pleats was the common way.

For the small-kilt, as you mention, pleating to sett is most common,
except for the military style which is to stripe.

As we are comparing sizes, I'm 5'9" and 200+ lbs, wearing only 5+ yards
pleated to sett, and I am told it looks great! On the other hand, I haven't
tried it in anything but warm weather - and wouldn't want to be relying
on it in cold. It's cheap material anyway - someday I'll have the pounds
saved for a *real* greatkilt.

This is true in theory, but, as Lord William was trying to suggest, if
emphasis is placed on winning, as it is in any sport, then the fighter
with the best equipment will have the best chance to win.  I don't
think Lord William meant that he thought this was how it was supposed
to work, just that if one aproaches fighting as a sport, this is a
logical extension.  The point is that SCA combat should not be thought
of as a sport.

This is a Midrealm standard, my lord.  Minimum shield weights do not
exist in the East, or, as far as I know, anywhere else in the SCA.

At the very least, there should be sufficient firefighting equipment on hand

There are minimum shield weights in An Tir. (I think 10lbs, but as I am not a fighter
and was given the number 2 years ago, I'm probably quite wrong).


I agree, fighting should not be considered a sport. Once you do that you start
ignoring the rest of the Society, and those of us who don't fight have just as
much to contribute. Fighting is just one aspect of the entire "thing" we call the
society, and should be handled as such. Just because it is often the most noticable
thing at an event....

I'll up the ante; I once saw Duke Master Moonwulf Stakadderson (Baron 
Rivenstar, and my former tutor) take on 14 (fourteen) and win - rather
easily, actually.  He also (not incidentally) fights "Florentine" or
the case of swords.  That was 14 at once, not one at a time.  I alsoo
once saw Count Sir Emrys of Gwyntarian, when King of the Middle, offer
to hold the field - and no one appeared.  

The most important element in winning these lopsided contests is reputation;
the opposition goes in expecting to die - and does.

  Instead of pushing them to "come out of their shells and work with the
rest of us", how about you working with them?  Don't try to make them do
what *you're* interested in - help them do what *they're* interested in.
You say that your barony doesn't have the time nor the knowledge to help
someone with different interests, and that is understandable.  But why
not point them towards someone elswhere in the kingdom who *is* interested
in the same thing, then encourage the newcomer to share what they've
learned with the rest of the group.

  I also believe that things run more smoothly when everyone has some
common interests.  I do not, however, believe that the burden of having
something in common should fall completely on a newcomer.  It should be
shared - people should be encouraged to explore whatever interests them,
and the rest of the group should at least attempt to learn something
about each others' interests.  By trying to force people into the narrow
range of activities that the rest of the group likes, you are not only
driving away good people, you're also making it harder and harder for
the next person to "fit in" by continuing to limit the areas that the
barony as a whole has experience with.

  I know I've made some huge generalizations here, but I think you
can understand the idea behind it.  I have lived in places where
everyone is free (and encouraged!) to "do their own thing", and it
really does work!  I've also been in places where Fiacha's attitude
prevails, and people don't even realize what they're missing.  There's
a world of opportunities for fun in the SCA, and no one should be denied
the chance to have fun in their own way just because the people they
happen to live near don't share (or have never been exposed to) their
interests.

I agree in theory, but in practise I feel that it is inordinately difficult
to do something different and do it well enough to be recognized and respected
for it. It is worse when there is group who have been doing X, too far away 
for regular visits but near enough to sneer at your efforts when you meet at
events.

Thus I feel that a beginner should be in step with his group. On the other
hand I will always encourage someone to be different provided that they have
the skill and confident to carry it through. The thing I hate most is watching
someone decide to give up.

Yes, but not by collecting half hearted attempts or by having the blind lead
the half blind into the darkness. I find it almost impossible to persuade
someone that they are wrong about something that they have been teaching for
years, i.e. longer than I have been in the SCA.

Yes, but I don't wish to indulge in gossip or be accused of slander or libel
so I will not name names or places in public.

This barony was until fairly recently and the current trend towards dry sites
is not helping.

I agree, but a group of celts cannot teach a mundane how to act like a
cavalier. A worse problem is that of garb. Our group of early persona do
not know where to get or how to make cavalier garb. Of course it can be done
but it will take lots longer and our seamstresses and tailors are buzy with
garb for their own era. Equally none of us can necessarily recognize a worthy
level of authenticity and craftsmanship in fields so far removed from our own.

I know that our Baroness feels that we should all be doing our stuff for the
glory of it and not for awards and prizes. Unfortunately, I see people getting
discouraged and giving up because they are not getting the awards they feel
they deserve.

I maintain that it is more fun if you have something is common with the rest
of the group or even just a small part of it.

> Lord Kwellend Njal

A part of this preaching is because there are too many people in the Barony
who are quietly disappearing. They come to some events, they are good at what
they do but they are not coming to meet the new people and they are not
teaching the things that they do. I have to wonder what they get out of the
events that they come to and why they stay with the SCA. Most of all, I wish I
knew how to get them to come out of their shells and work with the rest of us.

Any suggestions will be gratefully recieved.

Subject: Pennsic and drought

What I say here should not be taken as more than rumor/speculation at this
point.  Still, if we don't get a significant amount of rain in the next month,
this year's War will be noticeably affected.  People may want to start thinking
about planning for it.

Before you dive into the swimming hole, make sure there's water in it.

If the Coopers' wells have enough water, it may still be the stuff from the
very bottom of their wells (we strain their wells even in a good year) in which
case it'll be good for washing dishes but not very attractive as drinking
water.  I understand that the Coopers are already looking into contingency
plans to truck in water.

I don't know whether extraordinary precautions against dehydration are called
for.  Intuition suggests that they're not.

The most important thing to consider seems to be the fire hazard.  "Each camp
site is encouraged to bring a fire extinguisher" isn't going to be enough.
Note that the main hazard here is likely to be burning grass rather than
burning tents.  Be *paranoid* about not building fires too close to anything
you don't want burning, and don't even *think* of smoking out in the field or
on the grass.

Other thoughts?

Greetings!

Lord Dani, I would take your thoughts as more than speculation: I call
them good common sense.  I will communicate your concern to Baron
Lawrence, the autocrat, that he might consider them before the last
minute.

On my own part, I will be thinking about what extra measures Herald's
Point ought to take to deal with the increased fire risk and potential
water shortage.

I thank you.

Subject: Re: fighting medievally

Quite a firebrand indeed!  I do not intend to burst into flame, 
however  :-)

Ideals, the real WHY in why we do this stuff, are going to vary 
widely with people and with territory.  Also, the extent to which
one should dress, camp, act and speak medievally is determined by the 
culture of your kingdom and by the way you personally view the SCA.
In the West it is generally accepted that we are trying to recreate
medieval historical atmosphere (not a fantasy novel), but that we 
are doing this as a fun thing, as well.  As long as your garb, speech,
and decorum are within the accepted norm of not clashing with a medieval
atmosphere, you're doing fine.  As for armor...
well, I was surprised to see someone sad at the anachronism of a
bascinet with grille.  I think of the grille on these helmets as an
anachronism that we live with for the sake of safety.  Alterations of 
'viking' helms, spangenhelms, conicals with nasals, etc. are also 
done, frequently with grillework, because that fighter wants to recreate 
that early period armor and still be field-legal.  Our newer
innovations in styling of these have allowed much of the original 
flavor to remain, especially when the fighter expends the effort to 
make it look nice (leather covering the bottom part of the helm to
create the illusion of only wearing a conical, chainmail coifs and
camails, etc).  I am MUCH happier to see this sort of 'modernism'
on the field than I am to see carpet armor and duct tape, with plastic
knee pads.  OK, I admit that it's hard to beat the look of, say, 
my squire-brother in his surcote with cross, pot-helm and authentic
arms and gauntlets.  It *really* looks like he just stepped out of the
second crusade.  Not everyone wants to recreate that period (or can 
afford it).  I'm really happy just to see that a fighter has made 
lots of effort at looking period, and if he has Vibram soled boots,
or his surcote is polyester doesn't bother me.  The West has an order
called the Silver Mantle for those fighters who succeed in looking 
extremely period on the field (it's not a huge order), and I don't
think that even they hold grillework or stainless steel against a
candidate.  More importantly, I don't think any advantage is gained 
on the field by these modernisms.  Far more fights have been won
by modern techniques being used on the field than by modernisms in
armor.  I wear 50 pounds of 13th century plate, but not everyone
can, nor should they have to.  

Another related point is that no matter how hard we try, our armor 
is going to be very high-tech compared with medieval armor.  Ours 
is rather butch on the average (I'm talking plate here).  We abuse
our armor a lot more than medieval soldiers did, so it must be made to
withstand this steady abuse (some call it practice :-)).  We have 
ready-made sheet metal, beverly shears, power grinders, power sanders, 
oxy-aceteline(sp?) welders and such that I don't want to give up any
more than I want to give up running water and clean privies at a
tourney.  I admire the ideal of a perfect reproduction, but I also 
work for a living.  These ideals are part of why we bother with all this
fighting business, however, and I think a lot of people could deal with 
a stronger infusion of them. (no, I won't tell who I'm thinking of! :-)

	That should really be "to get maximum *protection*."  Under
the rules we fight by *everyone* is considered to be wearing the
same equipment for purposes of blows.

	I've seen plastic, but never fiberglass (other than as a facing
on a shield.  It breaks too easy in my (mundane) experiance to make
good armor.)  There are minimum shield weights,  so if the marshalls
are doing thier jobs then the plastic shield should convey no
advantage.  Most of the other modern materials I've seen in equipment
were used to replace period materials that the person was not able
to work with or had no access too (plastic for horn is a reasonable
substitution, as long as it's not hot pink or lime vert...)  Sad
to say, but the problems with heavy blows exist, and there are two
ways to attack them, an appeal to chivalry and an appeal to sports-
manship.  One is SCA oriented, the other is geared more to the
mundane standards we are all familar with.  Tactically smart ways
of making it through a tourney are, somewhat, period (and many are
safety considerations as well.)

	Part of this I can sympathise with, part of it I can't.
When modern materials can be substituted for period ones in a 
manner that does not compromise the appearance of the armor, but
does increase the safety, then I'm all for it.  (Foam underplates,
ways of allowing equipment to breath better, things like that.)
The open-faced bascinet with a grill is a compromise, the basic
helm is period, the grill is required for safety reasons, as are
the bars on *all* the helms that have them.  I applaud your
resolve, but not all of us can manage to make or afford fully
period equipment.  And in all cases *some* sacrifice to safety
will have to be made.  I refuse to use a basket hilt, in 1030
there weren't any.  But gauntlets that are combat safe aren't
period for me either!  We have to make compromises.

>William de Corbie

	(Bill the Crow?)  I agree in principle.  A couple of weekends
ago I participated in a prize tourney.  Double elimination, each person
was to bring two prizes, the first to given to the consort of the person
you lost to, the second to the person who defeated you.  Presenting the
prizes to my lady was the high point of the day for me.  I would like
it if we went back to tht original concept of all honors won by the 
fighter went to the fighters consort (be it Lord or Lady).  I think that
this would stop some "win at all cost" mentality (though not all of it.)
How does this sound?

Subject: kilts (what else?)

  I'm 6'4", 180 lbs.  I have tried kilts of 6-7 yards, but the
  hang just doesn't quite cut the mustard.  The major pleating
  technique for short kilts preserves the pattern (I'll avoid
  the quite tedious details of how to do it), and requires
  very deep pleats to come out right.  The technique is a
  mimicry of modern kilts.  The only documentation I have seen
  for period kilts, however, uses a different pleating style.
  It doesn't preserve the origional pattern, but instead produces
  a horizontal striped pattern on the pleated section.  The
  pleats are shallower, and there are far more of them, as they
  don't cover as much horizontal length.  For this type of
  kilt, I have discovered that 10 yards is optimal.  This
  is based on aestethic and practical considerations.  I use
  a winter weight wool, a heavy tightly woven plaid, 100%
  if I can find it, otherwise a min of 80% with as much silk
  as possible.  It is heavy enough to keep me warm in high
  winds and snow, and light enough for spring/summer.  The
  hang is about correct for the sketches I have.  I don't
  have any documentation that the deep pleating is not period,
  but I'd guess it was not very common.

                                In service,

ever since getting on the net (less than a week ago, methinks), I have been

better character traits :-).  Ever since I was in 6th grade, I have been
interested in things medieval... I have heard of the Society for Creative
Anachronism before, and I thought that it might be a good thing if I 
joined it.  Now I find the 'fire rekindled,' if you will... I would like
more information on this society, if some kind soul would care to mail me

BTW, I have already posted a similar message (similar to this one, that is)

it had the wrong return address on it.  This message has the right one...

                              Novelty Shoot Rules

                                  Poppin Jay

  The  Poppin  Jay was originally shot against a live animal.  For the purposes
of this competition there will be a stuffed bird roughly the size of a Canadian
Goose secured to the top of a pole some 60 meters from the firing line.

  The object is to be the first to impale the bird.  If there are multiple hits
in one flight the bird will move back 10 meters and be shot  at  again.    Each
person will continue shooting as long as he hits.  The last person remaining is
to be declared the winner.

  No one will be eliminated until there has been a successful hit on the bird.

  There is a special prize for the first person(s) to impale the pole the  bird
is secured to.

                                 William Tell

  The  William  Tell  shoot  is  an  attempt to recreate the daring feat of the
aforementioned William Tell.  We shall, however, not use a live target

  The target will consist of an apple secured to the top of a boy sized  target
set  20  yards  distant  for the first round and 30 yards for the second round.
The target will be moved to 40 yards if a shoot off is required.

  Ranks will fire flights of six shafts at the apple.  The first clean  hit  on
the  apple  wins.  If there are multiple hits on the apple then there will be a
second round shot.  If there are still multiple hits the there will be a sudden
death  shoot  off  with  the sequence determined by random draw.  The shoot off
will continue until a second place has been chosen.   If  there  are  only  two
person in the shoot off it will of course end when the first hit is scored.

                                  Wand Shoot

  The Wand Shoot is a traditional test of archers skill.

  The  target is a wand placed in vertically at a point 25 yards from the line.
In the case of a shoot off the wand will be moved to 35 yards.  The wand is  to
be a wooden post some 4 cm wide and 150 cm tall.

  There  will  be  two flights of six shafts each with the aggregate high score
winning.  Points are to be counted for each shaft which is stuck in the wand at
scoring.

  If  after  the second flight there is no winner a sudden death shoot off will
occur at 35 yards.  The sequence for the shoot off will be determined by random
draw.   The shoot off will continue until a second place is chosen unless there
were only two people in the shoot off, since it will naturally be done.

                                 Mixed Doubles

  The Mixed Doubles is a team event consisting of  an  untimed  flight  of  six
shafts  at 30 and 40 yards for each member of the team and a timed flight of 30
seconds at 30 yards for each member of the team.  The targets will be  standard
60cm  round  faces.  As always an arrow cutting the line will be counted as the
higher score.

  The highest aggregate score will be declared the winner.  If a shoot  off  is
necessary it will be a timed shoot of 30 seconds at 30 yards.

                                  Clout Shoot

  The Clout Shoot tends to show the power of massed archers.

  The  target  is  a  5 meter circle placed on center 75 meters from the center
gate of the firing line.  Archers will fire two flights  of  6  shafts  at  the
target.    The  archer  with  the greatest number of hits will be awarded first
place.

  If there is a tie after the first two ranks there will be a third and more as
needed to produce a winner and second place.

                               Watermelon Shoot

  The  Watermelon  Shoot is somewhat an extension of the clout shoot except the
object is to hit a head sized watermelon which is placed in  a  crenelation  of
the  clout  target.    First  hit  wins.  Ties to be settled by shoot off.  The
winner gets the watermelon

                                   Ballesta

  The Ballesta shoot is mostly for fun.  It is a renewal of an  old  tradition.
The target is a wooden pole placed 150 meters from the firing line.

  Each  competitor will be given three ranging shots and two competition shots.
The projectile will be a roughly 2.5 Kilo mass and may  be  irregularly  shaped
and fragile ( they will not be bags of flower.)

  The  closest  hit  to  the  target  pole  of any of each engines shot will be
declared the winner and the second closest team will be declared second.  There
will be a special prize for this competition.

                                   Iron Man

  The  Iron  Man  shoot is a physical drain. It is a simple speed shoot against
standard 60cm targets.  It consists of two rounds.

  The first round is 2 minutes at a 30 meter target.  The  second  round  is  1
minute at a 40 meter target.  The high score wins.

Yep.  Sortof.  Only we don't use mail to process the information, but
just to send it, and not everyone gets it, and it's probably slower
coast-to-coast than {bit,arpa}net but anyone with a unix-box and
a modem and a telephone line can hook up to it *unlike* {bit,arpa}net.

Because god gave some machines the gift of high financing, wherein
they could afford expensive datacommunications, and other machines
god gave the gift of inexpensiveness so that even a lowly college

I truly enjoyed your account of a count (Earl, really) defeating "the

(The Prince's Guard of Cynagua) at June Crown Tourney.  This takes 
a great deal of tactical experience, as well as great fighting ability.
Have people in Kingdoms other than mine (West) done collective study
on medieval and SCA tactics and strategy?  Several commanders of 
war units here are trying to put together a War College, and I wondered
if this was being done elsewhere already and if ideas could be shared.  
Viscount Sir Brandon D'Arindell has taught small-unit tactics classes at 
Collegiums, but not a whole lot else has been done (to my knowledge;
I would be happy to learn I am wrong in this respect).  I figure there
*must* be some sort of strategical studies (especially in kingdoms so
close to Pennsic); anybody like to share?

One should never forget that even if noone in one's one group is engaged in 
one's own favorite medieval activity, someone out there almost certainly is, 
and there may even be a newsletter about it.
so whatever it is, do it.  if you see an artical in TI or Creative Anacronist 
or your Kingdom Newsletter on it, write to the author; he/she will certainly 
be flattered and might even write back.  If you don't see one, write one, 
maybe someone will write to you.
And travel if you can.  Its not easy to make friends outside your own group, 
but it is possible.
This may be cold comfort to a silk embroiderer in a barony of hairy 
helm-bashing barbarian brewers, or the only red-blooded saxon in a shire of

When I joined the SCA, I was under the impression that fighting was
something people did because they liked to play knights and because
they were interested in weapons and military history. At least, that
is what makes ME interested.
But SCA fighting is not just that. It seems that many people think of
it as a sport, like football. If SCA fighting is a sport, then the
obvious goal is for every fighter to practise so that he can beat the
others, and to improve his equipment to get maximum efficiency.

Thus, we see fiberglass armor, plastic shields and other modern ma-
terials and devices which are intended to give the user an advantage.
We also get "rhino hiding" and long debates about what constitutes a
killing blow, and tactically smart ways of making it through a tourney.

While I have great respect for martial artists and other sportsmen, I
find it difficult to adjust to this attitude toward SCA fighting. The
goal in a tournament should not be to win, but to fight chivalrously.
The goal in armoring should not be to invent something new and deva-
statingly effective, but to faithfully reproduce medieval armor. The
sight of an open-faced bascinet with a grille makes me sad. I would
far rather lose all my fights in a perfect replica of a 13th century
suit of armor than win in some sort of hi-tech Darth Vader-outfit.

I think we must strive to get back to a more serious approach to
fighting. It should not be a sport. It should be re-creation, chival-
ry and learning.

Now there is a firebrand for you to chew on!

really though the problem is more than just fighters wearing stupid
looking plastic armor, or otherwise wearing stuff that "isn't period".

There's things like using coleman lanterns.  Coleman lanterns are harsh
to begin with, but they're definitely not period.  I make it a habit to
bring along candles, and find that to (usually) be enough light.

There's things like thermos's and coolers.  But then as it was pointed
out to me when I asked about forsooth camping techniques, food poisining
is also period.  I do like to avoid poisining myself.

Then there are events where the autocrat seems to think the reasonable thing
is to have people park their cars amongst the tents.  I really dislike
seeing that happen, but what can you do?  Most camping grounds were built
for mundanes that *like* to have their car next to the tent.

It's not often that I find something here I disagree with quite
strongly, but I certainly do take exception to the statement that
anyone (even a beginner who isn't sure what s/he wants to learn about)
should attempt to confine his or her SCA activities to those currently
in vogue in the local group.  I heartily second Lord Kwellend Njal's
reasonable response to the post in which this came up.  Please
understand that I don't wish to throw my weight around or cause any
personal grief, but I do feel so strongly about it that I want to put
my two cents' worth in.  What I have to say about it comes from me on a
personal basis, not necessarily from my office (though it certainly
falls squarely within the scope of the concerns of that office.)

This group-think situation was precisely what I encountered in the
shire where I joined, and of course I refused to go along with it,
thereby experiencing an appreciable amount of ostracism from the other
members.  The rewards of choosing to explore the arts and sciences
freely far outweighed the social consequences, and now that I'm years
away from that situation, I am sure I made the right choice!

I hope that nobody has to live with such circumstances in this
enlightened day and age ;-), but I see that the attitude which
engenders it is not dead.  To those who may hold such an attitude, I
say that diversity is strength, and there's hardly any aspect of
medieval life which is not worthy of study by whatever gentles may find
it interesting.  To those who may be on the receiving end of such an
attitude, I suggest networking with others of like interests to
yourselves, by means of this forum, physical newsletters, and whatever
other means you can find.  In many cases, you can work with people who
live hundreds or thousands of miles away, and all parties benefit from
the contact.  Often you can find people much closer to home who share
your interest, as well!  Perhaps there may even be someone "in the
closet" in your home group (this happened to me, in fact.)

And never be afraid to saunter into a Shire meeting in garb that's
completely different from anything ever seen in that group before.  If
it's reasonably authentic, you have nothing whatsoever to be ashamed of
(provided all mundane laws are observed, of course. ;-)  

Since cold shoulders, alas! may be all too real, I can't promise that
one gentle who is true to him/herself can enlighten an entire Shire (I
never did, in six years, but then I wasn't exactly well-socialized in
those days, either.)  But if you are both persistent in working in your
area of interest, and reasonable when approached by others, you may
find that you have started a trend.  

In other words, assume that you have a fundamental right to pursue
whatever studies interest you.  You do.

Subject:      A Tale

A tale of prowess for those who like such things--

Last Saturday in the Barony of Carolingia there was held a Midsummer's Day
Tourney in high degrees of scorching heat.  As at all current gatherings in
the East Kingdom, the King's whim that the chivalry should take on all comers
from the Knowne World was obeyed.  In spite of the temperature, all made ready
and took the field.  Sides were drawn,  Eight (or perhaps ten, but I don't want
to exaggerate as this really is true!) unbelted fighters stood ready to face
the chivalry.  The chivalry stood ready to face the fighters--all one of him.
Earl Sebastian Nightwind stood with his two swords and a smile staring at the
fighters lined up across from him.  The sidelines were optimistically hoping
the battle would last at least thirty seconds.


As "lay on" was called, the "world" advanced in a solid wall toward the lone
knight who stood his ground for only a moment.  Then running with amazing
agility (as the bystanders were wilting without armour or motion), he rounded
the advancing line and took out a leg of an end fighter.  As he continued his
circuit without stopping, the fighters broke off in confusion into pairs and
trios, ready to fight the knight who was buzzing around them like a bothersome
bee.  However, like a bee he did not stop long, pauwsing only to take out legs
in passing.  If perchance one of his one-legged victims decided to lift himself
and hopped off madly in pursuit, Sebastian turned around and took off their
other leg.  Soon the field was full of fighters kneeling in wait for their
fate.

Most of the fighters were killed quckly in turn with no injuries to Sebastian.
The last two he faced were one of his own squires, of whom he summarily
disposed, and one of Master Farrel's, whose name I regrettably do not remember.
The latter did succeed in injuring Sebastian but not in killing him.

Needless to say, after the final killing blow was struck by Sebastian, the
incredulous crowd filled the air with cheers and yells of wonder and glee.
Sebastian still looked less affected by the heat than most of those applauding.

Subject: IKAC Query

When we shoot an IKAC (Inter-kingdom archery competition) why are we asked to
report the number of arrows shot in the speed rounds?  I've never heard of this
information being used for anything.

Is it meant as a tie-breaker?  (If it is, what's better, 20 points with 5
arrows or 20 points with 7 arrows?  If you're down to three seconds, can you
improve your situation by *throwing* a couple of arrows?)

My first guess, in the absence of solid information, is that once upon a time
the data was asked for by someone who meant to do something with it, and ever
since then it's been reported out of inertia.

Does anyone know?

             Life in the Current Middle Ages

SCA is the Society for Creative Anachronism, which is a group
dedicated to recreating the Middle Ages in the present. Many
groups meet weekly, and at these meetings we dance, talk, study,
learn, revel, and make plans. But first, let's get a little bit
of info about the SCA in general.
 
              Where did the SCA come from?
              ___________________________
 
 The avowed purpose of the SCA is the study and recreation of the
 European Middle Ages, its crafts, sciences, arts, traditions,
 literature, etc. The SCA "period" is defined to be 600 AD to 1600 AD,
 concentrating on the Western European High Middle Ages. Under
 the aegis of the SCA we study dance, calligraphy, martial arts,
 cooking, metalwork, stained glass, costuming, literature....
 well, if they did it, somebody in the SCA does it (Except die of
 the Plague!).
 
 As you can probably guess, the thing that separates the SCA from
 a Humanities 101 class is the *active* participation in the
 learning process. To learn costuming, you design and build
 costumes. To learn SCA infantry fighting, you make armor,
 weapons, shields, etc., and put them on and go learn how it
 feels to wear them when somebody is swinging a (rattan) sword at
 you. To learn brewing, you make (and sample!) your own wines,
 meads and beers.
 
 You will frequently hear a SCA person describe the SCA as
 recreating the Middle Ages "as they ought to have been." In some
 ways this is true -- we have few plagues, indoor plumbing, few
 peasants. In the dead of winter we have other things to eat than
 King's venison, salt pork and dried tubers.
 
 The SCA was invented (? discovered? begun?) in 1966 in Berkeley,
 California by a group of Science Fiction and Fantasy fans who
 wanted a "theme" party. Following the party, a group got
 together to discuss the idea of a medieval re-creation and
 re-enactment group. (which has ended up being much like the
 Civil War, Revolutionary War or Buckskinning re-enactment groups
 that were beginning to form in the US.) In Britain Medieval and
 British Civil War recreation societies had existed for any
 number of years. The Californians incorporated as a non-profit
 educational society, started forming groups, and away they went.
 
 Since 1966, the society has grown to include nearly 13,000
 paying members in the US, Canada, Mexico, Great Britain, Sweden,
 Germany, Italy, France, Korea, Okinawa, New Zealand, Australia
 and Greenland. Current demographic estimates indicate that for
 every dues-paying member there are 4 non-subscribing members
 active in local groups.
 
               How is the SCA Organized?
               ________________________
 
 The SCA is a feudal society. No democracies for us! The SCA
 "Knowne World" is divided into twelve Kingdoms, each with a King
 and Queen (who rule by right of arms), a Prince and Princess
 (heirs to the throne), and a council or Curia of Great Officers
 who handle the mundane, day to day details of running the
 kingdom.
 
 A feudal society takes its form from the idea of honor and duty.
 A noble owes duty of service to his lord, who might be a Baron or
 Knight.  His lord owes in return the duty of protection from danger and 
 food, money, etc. when times are bad.
 
 On the next level up, the higher nobles owe fealty (the word that
 encompasses this idea of reciprocal responsibilities) to the
 King. In return for their service as good stewards of the land
 and readily available warriors, the King owes Knights, Barons, and 
 other high nobles protection, honor, and a return of money, food, etc in 
 times of hardship. It is something like the idea of a Pyramid
 club, but the benefits are greater and the idea of personal
 honor and mutual responsibility, not profit, tie the structure
 together (or at least it did in Europe for nearly a thousand
 years).
 
 In the SCA this structure underlies our Society, although not
 nearly as rigidly as in the medieval days. Our King, the head of
 our Kingdom and our liege lord, has fought for the right to bear
 the crown by fighting in a Crown Tourney for the right to make
 his Lady Queen. <In the case of female fighters, she has fought
 for the right to make her Lord King.> In some Kingdoms, like the West
 (middle California), the King's word is law, and the people willingly
 obey his every whim. Of course, four to six months later there is a new
 King, with different ideas. Life can get interesting.
 
 Fighting in the SCA, or Why are those people hitting each other?
 _______________________________________________________________
 
 Fighting in the SCA evolved from what happened when two armed
 knights were unhorsed and had to fight on the ground. It
 resembles nothing so much as medieval infantry fighting. There
 are two basic types of SCA fights: single combat, and group or
 team battles, known as melees. SCA fighting does have rules. The
 first, and most important rule, is that each and every fighter
 on the field has honor. The fighter keeps faith with his honor
 by accepting blows that would be killing or wounding (more about
 this a little later).
 
 The second is like unto it; A fighter keeps faith with his
 brother fighters by acknowledging his opponent's word -- if he
 says it was light, it was light. Since we prefer that no one get
 hurt, SCA fighting is done with real armor (made with leather,
 metal, padding, kydex, etc) and rattan swords. Rattan is that
 bamboo-y stuff, only with a solid core, that furniture is made
 of. Rattan, surprisingly enough, is springy enough to absorb
 some of the force of the blow (although blows are *real solid*)
 and light enough to approximate a real steel sword. Swords are
 made by wrapping rattan staffs with strapping tape, covering
 them with duct tape (known as silver tape) for esthetic reasons,
 and attaching some sort of hilt or handle. Armor is much more
 complex -- some armor, being made of steel, rivets, leather,
 etc, can take more than 40 hours per piece of armor (for
 example, a armored "glove" with moving fingers and joints can
 take upwards of 75 hours to complete).
 
 There are several essential and required pieces of armor --
 helm, neck and cervical vertebrae protection, elbows and knees,
 kidneys, hands, groin. After that, most SCA fighters wear chest,
 leg, arm and forearm, and feet protection.
 
 If a blow hits hard enough that a sword would have cloven mail,
 it is "good". Beginning fighters, as they are being trained, are
 taught blow calibrations. Fighters are trained, by the way.
 Aspiring fighters attend some months of fighter practices where
 they learn the rules and learn how to protect themselves on the
 field. After some time, they attempt to "authorize" -- they go
 before a panel of experienced fighters, fight a couple of
 rounds, and if the panel decides the fighter is safe (not good,
 you understand, but unlikely to hurt him or herself or an
 opponent) they are authorized to fight in Tourneys. This process
 (from starting to fight to being authorized) can take from a
 couple of months to a year or more.
 
 Fighting brings us to *the Chivalry.* The Chivalry is a group of
 elite fighters -- those who have gotten very very good at
 fighting, and who at the same time have absorbed the concepts of
 Honor and Chivalry (they're basically good guys), have learned
 something of basic Heraldry, Chess, something about the Arts and
 Sciences, can behave well in public, and are generally good
 examples for people everywhere.
 
 (The word Chivalry comes from the Old French *chevalerie*
 <related to the Spanish *caballeria*>, meaning horse-fighter,
 cavalry, "knight". It came to French and Spanish from Latin
 caballerius, horse rider. As only the wealthy could afford the
 horse and trappings of a mounted warrior, it became the province
 of the nobles to be mounted and fighters. Thus the elite status.
 The word has come down to us from a different route as
 *cavalry*. Oh, well!) <There are rank-equivalents to Knights in
 the Arts and Sciences, called "Laurels", and in the Services,
 called "Pelicans". I will discuss them later on!>
 
 A King (if he is himself a Knight, and not all Kings are) can
 knight a fighter if he (or she) thinks the candidate is
 deserving. Usually the other Chivalry have agreed, or it doesn't
 happen. (If the King isn't a Knight, another member of the
 Chivalry can hold the sword with the King. Only a Knight can
 make a Knight.) The Knights swear personal fealty to the Crown.
 Since some people, for religious reasons, reasons of personal
 honor, etc, feel that swearing fealty is inappropriate for them,
 a branch of Chivalry has been created, called Masters, who do
 not have to swear fealty. Upon receiving the accolade of
 Knighthood, the candidate receives a Gold chain to wear about
 the neck, a white belt, and gold spurs. Some receive a *real*
 sword, as well.
 
       Why Do you all have such funny names?
       _____________________________________
 
 Every person in the SCA picks a name to use in the Society. It
 could be something simple (George of Wardcliff) or something
 elaborate (Dughall Aislean nic mac Lathurna). Most people pick a
 time period in the SCA "period" (between 600 and 1600) and a
 country (any place that can documentably be proven to have had
 trade with western Europe during the period), and choose a name
 from that. Some people just pick a name and forget about it;
 some have elaborate persona stories to go with their names.
 
 Even our towns have new names. Lansing, MI, is Northwoods,
 Toronto is Septentria, Boston is Carolingia, the San Francisco
 bay area is the Principality of the Mists, etc.
 
 Most folk in the SCA register their names and a heraldic device
 that they design to represent them. Also, later in their SCA
 careers, they may be given awards and rank, at which time their
 devices become "Arms" and they are most properly called "Lord"
 or "Lady So-and-So."
 
 Rank in the SCA, or How Come She is Wearing a Crown?
 ____________________________________________________
 
 There are two sorts of peers in the SCA; Royal Peers and Peers.
 Royal Peers are folk who have worn the crown of a Kingdom or
 Principality at least once. Ex-Princes are Viscounts,
 Ex-Princesses Viscountesses, and from there it gets complex.
 Those who have been King or Queen once are Counts/Countesses.
 Those who have been King or Queen twice are Dukes/Duchesses.
 Those who have been King or Queen more than that are generally
 considered masochistic! (Small in-joke!) Seriously, there are
 many who have reigned at least three times, and in the West
 there is a legendary Duke who has been King eight times.
 
 Other sorts of Peers are folk who, through dint of talent, hard
 work, and long effort, are recognized for their contributions
 and skills. We have already talked about the Knights. There are
 also the Companions of the Laurel (Talented craftsmen and artists,
 recognized for having talents and being willing to teach and be
 gracious), and the Companions of the Pelican (generally skilled
 bureaucrats -- somebody *has* to do the hard paperwork of running a
 Kingdom with 3000 people in it, and some people keep working at this
 sort of task for years.). The Pelican was thought in medieval times to
 be the most self-sacrificing animal -- it was thought a Pelican would 
 pierce her beast to allow her heart's blood to drip into the
 mouths of her offspring when food was short. Peers are made by
 the desire of the King and Queen in accordance with the
 recommendations of the rest of the order.
 
          Feasting, Dancing and Merrymaking
          ________________________________
 
 One of the most interesting parts of the SCA is the Events --
 the times when we put on our costumes, go out and dance those
 dances we've been practicing, flirt, eat, talk, and generally
 party. Events are held almost every weekend of the year
 somewhere in the country. Most groups hold at least one event
 per year; some larger groups will hold two or more.
 
 At events there are often tourneys, art exhibits or
 competitions, dance classes, workshops, and, later in the
 evening, Royal or Baronial Court, and dancing. Many times there
 will be a Feast in the evening. Other times, for smaller events
 or if a newer group is holding the event, there will be a
 dessert revel (People go out for dinner and then come back for a
 dessert buffet).
 
 The events are the most fun to most folk, because you get to go
 and show off all the things you have been learning in the past
 few months.
 
          What Kind of Person Joins the SCA?
          __________________________________
 
 SCA folk tend to be people like you and me -- just plain folks,
 but people who enjoy doing something more with their weekends. A
 high percentage of SCA members are involved in high tech fields
 -- Computers, Aerospace, high energy physics, etc. This has been
 attributed to the fact that people who play all week with highly
 complex, modern technology find it highly relaxing to spend
 their leisure time working with a different kind of technology,
 in a less modern setting. There are lots of people in all fields
 in the SCA -- historians, writers, secretaries, law enforcement
 personnel, teachers, programmers, insurance agents -- the appeal
 of the SCA is widespread.
 
 A housemate of a SCA person recently said: "From what I can tell
 about these wild and crazy SCA people, they do more than just
 this fighting thing. They really like to make and wear the
 medieval clothes (garb), eat the medieval food, dance the
 medieval dances to the medieval music, maybe even make their own
 medieval music, and other medieval party type activities. They
 also seem to like to be medieval so they can relax and have a
 good time. They are quite willing to talk about SCA or invite
 you to the SCA stuff or whatever."
 
               How You Can Get Involved
               _______________________
 
 We welcome you to our local meetings and our events. You needn't
 join the SCA, Inc, to attend and participate (although if you
 decide to be with us regularly you may wish to join). The only
 requirement to come to an event is that you make some attempt at
 pre-1600 costume -- and most groups have "loaner" costumes for
 people who want to come to their first event.
 
 If you want more information about groups near you, you can call
 our corporate office in Milpitas, CA, at (408) 262-5250, or send
 a notice to this mailing list or newsgroup, or contact the

  Lord Guillaume de Gonzac has a source for fencing equipment at wholesale
  prices, and is planning to resell it at a small markup (still better than
  you'd get in a store).  He lives in Concord, NH, but travels south on a
  fairly regular basis.  Getting the stuff to you shouldn't be a problem.

  I think he's starting out doing only pre-orders.  You can call him at
  (603)228-5776 for prices and to order; he's planning to place an order
  soon (he broke a blade at the S&M War last weekend, so he's motivated).

	These are both good for starters (and both good years later
too, I thought.)  There are also several good starter handbooks in
the different areas that you might find interesting.  And certainly
a handbook explaining local customs would not be a bad purchase, as
customs differ from Kingdom to Kingdom (and freaquently within them.)

	This I disagree with.  While it is *nice* if your interests 
mesh with those of the local group, in that you will have lots of help,
everyone doing the same thing is *not* good for the group!  I would
think that every group would hope to have the broadest representation
possible, so as to *not* discourage new members.

	In fact, the tone of the above quote (as explained by the 
examples given) bothers me quite a bit.  Are there really places in 
the Knowne World where doing something well is not enough to win
the respect of your peers?  Certainly everywhere I have lived has
respected the work of others, wether it was common or not, as long
as it was done well.  I'm sorry to see that there are people (and
I assume places) where this is not true, I feel it weakens us.

	There *are* groups of non-drinkers in the Society???  :-)
As for the cavalier in the group of celts, I would think that there
is a great potential for fun there, certainly my early Norse persona
has great fun with the cavaliers I know.

	But that does not mean you have to be either a copy of them or
even interested in the activities of the group (or vise versa), merely
that you can all work together.  Certainly talk to them, but don't let 
them force you to conform to the groups standards!

Subject: kilts


    My bitch with kilts shorter than 10 yards is that they don't
    flow very well when you walk.  They are also damnably cold
    in a snow storm.  They also don't have enough material to 
    make a decent pad under you when you roll up to sleep.  I
    also haven't been able to recreate the lines of a couple of
    sketches with a short kilt.  The sketch indicated that the
    pleated section covered the full width of the back, and used
    about 40-50 one square deep pleats.  The number 40-50 comes
    from experimentation, it is about the correct number of pleats
    to get it tightly pleated.  

    Arisades pleated along the length?  I had assumed (from
    drawings) that they were width pleated, and simply fairly
    wide.

Good Gentles:

I regret the necessity of having to post this and hope that it will not cause
a flurry of similar requests.  Unfortunately, time limitations have made this
my most viable option.

I will be in Cape Cod two weeks before Pennsic War with non-Society friends.
I'm looking for a ride out of the Cape or Boston or an area closer to
the Cape on Sunday, August 14 (give or take a day, I suppose).  As my War gear
will be transported that weekend by other friends, all I require is space for
my itty-bitty 5'2 body and an average suitcase.

Please respond to the above address.  Thank you for your patience.

Moongate does indeed sell quite nice period blades.  They also sell torcs
and armrings of twisted copper and brass that are really beautiful, and
they do custom work (I wanted one like the one they had there, but with
"donut" shaped finials rather than knobs -- they sent it thru the mail in
record time, and it cost me only $15).  They also show up at the occasional
eastcoast SF&F convention -- Darkover Grand Council is where I see them
(since I can only make it back there 2x/year so I don't go to Pennsic).

There are a couple of books that cover everything, including fighting, but
they cost and so are not handed out to possibly interested people (I am
refering to Queen Anne's Guide and the Knowne Worlde Handbook). On the
other hand, the East Kingdom has a 50 page handout for such people. In
general, it is better to meet the local group and find out what they will
help you to do. Doing something out of step with the local group will win
neither friends nor respect. That is, you would not enjoy being the perfect
cavalier in a groups of early celts; you would not enjoy being a master brewer
in a group of non-drinkers.

Most of us are here to have fun and be sociable. It is more fun if you are 
involved in what your group is doing. Thus you should talk to them first.

If you need a pointer to the nearest group to you, say so.

If you want to start a new group, you will need to get involved with the 
buraucracy right now.
If you want a copy of our handout, send me mail.

Mine is a mere 6 yards and I have not noticed how well or badly it flows as I
walk.

>     They are also damnably cold in a snow storm.
Try using a heavier cloth. Few fabrics are made to worn in a snow storm these
days. Modern weavers expect people to wear quilts in such weather and wool for
dress in temperate climates and temperature controlled buildings. Wool being
expensive goes further and is more profitable when woven in lighter weights.

Perhaps your ten yards is just providing the needed weight of fabric.

I don't understand. I get more than adequate pleats across the back from my
six yards. How deep are your pleats? How wide is your waist? I am not slim
but I have no problems getting my kilt to look right. On the other hand, I
have no sketches that I am trying to match. Possibly, I am doing everything
wrong, but if so, the people who compliment me and copy my style also have
the wrong ideas.

YOW!!! It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of extra plaid. I'm 6'4"
and 190lbs. My kilt is 7 yards and our local Celtic seamstress tells me that
even that is way too much. Most kilts can be folded out of 5-6 yards. Perhaps
it has something to do with your folding technique?!? The same goes for the
arisade. My lady's arisade is 3 yards and when she pulls it around her
shoulders she is engulfed. I find that my 7 yards are more than enough for
bedding. One should also note that all my measurements here include a 60"
width. Another interesting note is that the kilt is folded against the length
while the arisade is folded against the width.

A good color description! Remember though that in a "authentic" sense purple
was out of the question, blue was not at all common (and a rather pathetic
shade too!!), red follows the same rules as blue and black was not a
predominant color. This is for the 16th century. If you want to be authentic,
stick to earth tones. The Scots and Irish were a practical people not 
incredibly given to foppishness. Then again, in what I understand of the SCA,
you can wear whatever you want ;-)

Yep.  Well, not an opinion, exactly, but a lack of pragmatic knowledge.
My ideas in the posting were based on:
1. wathcing my brother fence and do heavy-weapons practice,
2. watching my brother make his plate armour,
3. a fair amount of experience in auto body-work,
4. making armour/padding for skateboarding/rollerskating.
(We skate in the streets of downtown Houston late at night.  Armour/padding
helps you survive 25mph spills into broken glass/asphalt.)


> The phrase "will probably be obvious to the most unskilled observer" in

Eek.  I meant that phrase to go down with the "aluminum armour" idea.
I've seen people whale away at armour on a dummy -- I have no idea how
hard they were actually hitting it, but they were flailing away for
all they were worth.

> The problem is that there is a whole range of blows that do not damage the

This is what I'm working on.  I'm trying to figure out a way to have armour
that would protect the wearer, while giving some sign as to how hard
the blows recieved are.  Maybe some sort of blister-packaged dye, or
maybe pressure sensitive material of some sort (that won't be visibly
obvious).  I'll think about it some more...

> A fighter also knows the impracticality of the breakaway armor idea.  Armor

I thought about it some more, and I see the problems... It was a pretty
lame idea.  Musta been my evil twin.

I have just compiled the interim voting results for the proposal
to upgrade alt.sca to a newsgroup within the mainstream heirarchies.
If you do not know of the proposal, or are interested, go to news.groups
or alt.sca and read.

The short answer -- YES: 48, NO: 4

Subject: Proposal to "upgrade" alt.sca to {rec,soc}.something.sca
Message-Id: <9919@e.ms.uky.edu>

This is the first interim report on the status of the vote for this
proposal.  I will be posting a report every sunday until the end
of the voting period.  Oh, that line in the original proposal saying
that the voting ended on august *32* --- well --- I'm surprised that
Matt didn't catch *that* typo :-) -- anyway, it was a mistake.  The
voting will end on august *2*, 30 days after july *3*.

First the results.  These will be a little strange because of the
way I am organizing the voting:  (Next week I'll post a list of names
along with the report).

bottom line results	YEA	48	NAY	 4

individual preferences:

category		YEA	NAY

rec.sca			  7	  0
soc.culture.sca		 17	  6
rec.org.sca		 31	  2
soc.sca			  1	  0
soc.org.sca		  5	  0
{rec,soc}.medieval{.sca}  6	  0
rec.history.sca		  0	  0	(mentioned because it was mentioned
					 in the newsgroups, but I never got
					 a vote for it.)
comp.sca (!)		  2	  1

any name			 18
wait for students to return	  1
people who don't get alt	  5


My first thought is that I should have thought a little more in the
original posting and either thought up some of those other names, or
explicitly left it open for people to suggest names.  There is a
definite skew towards the names which I suggested.  Some of the other
names, especially something like rec.medieval.sca, are really good
names and perhaps if I had thought of that one and mentioned it in the
original posting it might have had a fairer chance at votes.  Except
rec.medieval doesn't lend itself well to subgroups -- while there are
other medievel recreationist societies none are as popular/wide-spread
as the sca.

Of the people who I put under "any name", this included people who
explicitly said "any name is fine" and also people whom I thought,
from the tone of their message, would accept any name.  To put someone
into another category they'd need to have mention a name.

The "any name" group is significant ...  Most said they didn't really
care about the name but merely wanted the group.  This provides
some proof for a theory I saw mentioned in news.groups recently --
it analogized newsgroups to be more-or-less equivalent to "clubs".
At a chess club you will find MOST of the conversation being centered
on *chess*, but there will be other topics as well.

What it means to me is that the name of the group is only used in
situations where you are referring to the group, either in speech
or in writing.  That the name should raise some mental images.  But
once you're "in" the group -- reading/writing postings in the
group & etc -- the name is not important, the discussion which goes on
there is all important.

The "don't get alt group" seems apropos to the proposal.  A number
of people have flamed at me because I implied that alt wasn't "real"
or (something I didn't say, nor feel) that it was a "trashcan".  The
"don't get alt group" are ones who don't get it and said so -- I feel
it likely that some of the other voters are at sites that don't get it,
but didn't say so.  Anyway, part of the reason for moving alt.sca to
another place is so that we can reach a larger audience than we will
ever reach through alt.

I REPEAT THIS AGAIN!  I AM NOT PROPOSING A NEW & SEPERATE GROUP FROM
THE EXISTING ALT.SCA!  I AM PROPOSING TO MOVE ALT.SCA!  THE GATEWAY
BETWEEN THE NEWSGROUP & MAILING LIST WILL CONTINUE TO FUNCTION, ONLY
THE NAME OF THE NEWSGROUP WILL CHANGE!


Got that? :-)

Subject: Re: Fighting BS (uh, i mean Blow Strength :-)
Message-Id: <966@hjuxa.UUCP>

I've been putting it off for a while, but after reading some of the
postings, I feel like adding my two pence. If you are not interested in
fighting trivia, you may be bored - Fair warning.

Firstly, in his postscript to his reply to Mr Townsend's reply to his
posting (I think that is right, but I'm not sure), Master Kobayashi writes:

In article <8807051756.AA00331@spica2.prime.com>, akobayas@spica2 (Andrew Kobayashi) writes:

The level of presumed armour that Master Kobayashi states is what I was
taught as well. As the armour standards rose and I became more involved in
the whys and hows, my thinking and teaching changed. I have started to use
the term "incapacitating blow" when refering to acknowledging blows. For the
period I am interested in (100 Years War), and to a large extent earlier,
the idea was to incapacitate rather than kill your opponent. Knocking him
down, dropping on his chest with a dagger in your fist, and asking how much
ransom he was worth was the normal (and Norman :-) passtime of the rich and
famous.

Another justification for the term "incapacitating" need not be explained
to anyone who fights (or fought) in just a gambason as body armour. A hard
blow to the chest, belly, back, or arms takes an awful lot of the fight out
of a person. Rumors to the contrary, chain does not help much (but the
bruises are much more interesting :-). The 1.25 inch weapons we use spread
the blow about as much as chain would for a 1.25mm sword blade, so mail
confers little extra protection for its weight (although it is pretty). The
force needed to break a rib (that would stop me!) is less than that needed
to cut chain mail.  The force to discourage an opponent wearing chain mail
is even less, and overall, calibration seems even lower than that, thank
heavens.

Second, Brigid (I believe) in an aricle I have lost asked about level of
blows and gave an example of Duke Morgan's sword brooming after one
tournement. There are several explanations for why this might happen:

	A) The new sword was old rattan or rattan that had been wet and
	   dried several times. This is common away from the coasts
	   (and rattan wherehouses), you buy big when you can and make
	   swords as you need them. Dry or old rattan breaks down more
	   easily.
	B) He hit a lot of tip shots. I have observed that a lot of Eastern
	   fighers who use large shields hit with the tip end of the sword.
	   This makes a fast strike that beats the defence's large shield
	   while not showing much of your arm around your own.  This is
	   a trap that is easy to fall into, since the tip is fastest and
	   can hit hard (I can dent 12 gage this way); however, it usually
	   does not feel right to an opponent (although he will probably
	   have to ask a marshal why) and it would not be incapacitating
	   through armour.
	C) He was hitting too hard.
From what little I have seen of His Grace, it was probably a combination of
A and B. This is not a denegrating comment against him, but I would think
twice before closing on him. (Well, maybe not, I love to be in the shield
wall with a great-sword!)

Thirdly, about using denting armour, *shudder*, no thank you. Real armour,
fake weapons for Mrs. Kay's oldest boy. That is one of my jobs as a marshal,
to keep people safe.

I guess that is too much for now. I hope what I said adds to enlightenment,
or at least is food for thought.

	Wow!  If it's ever found out that I agreed with Matt Crawford
	about anything, and the word gets back to talk.bizarre, I
	might as well pour cement in my keyboard.  In hopes of
	avoiding that, I took news.groups out of the distribution.
	Maybe even he won't see it.  Keep this just among us friends,
	OK?

	It really doesn't make much sense to be agitating for a spot
	in news distribution rather than alt distribution.  As Matt
	implied, they accomplish the same thing.  Alt.sca is a rousing
	success, with wide distribution already, and a healthy
	readership and rate of postings.  Better yet, to date it has
	not been invaded by the flame-for-fun crowd; you folks are
	some of the most civil folks on the net; I think the ideals of
	the SCA shine through every posting here; if it were my
	choice, I'd put the lot of you in charge of educating the
	young for a few generations, and see the whole world improve.

	You have a real advantage in staying in the alt distribution.
	Any site that has half a dozen or so SCA members or folks
	interested in membership can petition their sysop to find an
	alt feed.  Remember, from news.lists, the average number of
	news _readers_ at a site is around 30, so 6 is a big interest
	group at one site.  In these days of PC Pursuit, phone bills
	need not be a big problem, and the group articles can probably
	be transferred in an average of under 10 minutes a night.

	So being in the alt distribution doesn't cause any
	insurmountable problems, but does provide the benefits of
	being out from under the foot of net politics.  Recent rather
	ill considered proposals to moderate the whole net don't apply
	to alt groups, because an alt group isn't exactly in the net;
	the feeds are informal, don't need to be reported to anyone,
	and are subject only to decisions at the two sites concerned.

	I suggest, rather than going through the confusion of a change
	to a news distribution, you stick with this for a year or two
	and see how it works out.

	New topic!  I'm Kent Dolan (yes, _that_ Kent), and I was
	wandering around a specialty shop in town that provides
	authentic embroidered (hmmm) family crests, or whatever they
	are called, look like shields with designs on them, and with
	the help of a couple of immigrant Irish, found out that my
	family has a really ugly crest, can be traced back to the 12th
	century in County Mayo, Ireland, and was at that time called
	"O'Dobhailen".  That looks pretty good for an SCA name, far
	enough from my present one to make them seem independent, yet
	with a warm feeling of belonging.  My question is, is there
	something similar I can do with "Kent"?  I don't have access
	to the kind of reference material that would let me trace my
	given name back to an older form; can any of you out there
	help?  The usual thanks in advance.

	Summary for first topic: let me say it again, your tradition
	of service and chivalry is standing you in good stead in terms
	of the quality of postings I've seen, and it seems to be
	working well right here in alt.sca.  Why chance messing it up
	with a change that doesn't offer to do you much good at all?

I am sorry, I am confused.
I am reasonably familier with bitnet.
I have at least a working knowledge of arpa.
I dont know what in hell usenet is !
I get the impression that is this vague unix(that should tell me something in
the first place) thing that is kinda like a mailing list.
So my questions are
will it matter to people on the arpa/bitnet side what you call it?
why dont you unix people use list servers the way god intended ( ;-) )
??????
I also get the impression FREQUENTLY that I am missing half the discussion on
the list. Is there a sub thing on usenet that is not getting gated with the rest

of the sca stuff or what?
Bahhhh I always get this way when dealing with unixes...almost makes you long

And not rec.living-history.

If you look at the past 500 or so messages posted to this group, you'll see
that the clear majority are not on medieval topics but about the *SCA*.  If
someone thinks there is enough non-SCA traffic to justify a more general
'living-history' group (let alone hierarchy), why not start your own
alt.living-history group and see if it'll fly?  (It won't.)

Not having a full newsfeed, it won't make much difference to me, but
it could be neat to leave the way open for a .history subgroup of

Greetings!

I would like to begin a discussion on names in the SCA. The College of
Arms is currently re-evaluating its rules on the registration of
names, and plans to poll the populace on some significant questions.
In the mean time, I would like to get some feedback on the matter.  

I will first describe a framework for discussion, which I think will
make your comments more valuable by putting them in context.  Then, I
will give a thumbnail sketch of the Rules for Submission as they apply
to names, and try to illustrate those rules.  Finally, I will pose
some questions for discussion.

==============================

Before I begin, a couple ground rules.  Replies may be mailed to me or
posted.  I will try to respond to comments on the same medium on which
I receive them.  If the former, I may summarize & post the results of
discussion.   Please preface your first contribution with some
information: your SCA name, the period & location, or at least the
culture, from which you took your name, where you got started in the
SCA, and how long you have been a member.  I'm not trying to bias the
reading of remarks in favor of anyone; rather, I want to get a clear
idea of how feelings on these topics vary.

===============================

To the point:  The College of Arms registers SCA names for
individuals, branches, orders and awards, and other groups like
households.  Once a name is registered, it is protected from conflict
with any new name submission: basically, no new name will be
registered if it is too similar in appearance, sound, or meaning.  In
addition, for any name to be registered, it must meet certain
standards of authenticity, it must not be offensive, and it may not
imply a claim to high rank or honor, and may not imply non-human or
super-humna birth.

I will give typical examples and a bit of exlpanation of the
application of each standard.  Please note that some of my comments do
not exactly reflect the rules or even the practices of the College of
Arms, but rather reflect the prevailing philosophy.

Personal names might be judged to conflict if they share several
common words.  Thus, a recent submission in the East, Catriona
MacPherson the Fair, was returned for conflict with the registered
name Katrina MacPherson of Silverdiamond.  The two names share the
same given name (essentially), and both use the same primary surname.
In this case, the two names can be interpretted as alternate names for
the same individual.

In order to be considered sufficiently authentic, each element of a
name must be shown either to have existed in use as a name in period,
or to be constructed in a manner consistent with period usage.  Names
must be grammatically correct, and spelling vaiations must be
consistent with the actual variation in the source language.  For
example, I don't know off hand if the name Algiva exists in period.
However, we note that Middle English Godiva derived from Anglo-Saxon
Godgifu, which is constructed of two independent themes, God- + -gifu.
Another first theme found in AS names is Aelf-, and we find Aelfwine
becoming Middle English Aylwin or Alwin.  Thus, the AS name Aelfgifu
could reasonably have become ME Algiva.  This level of documentation
is not always required, but we do generally feel that every name
should be constructed correctly of period elements.  There are quirks
to this rule.  Because of the fantasy roots to the SCA, we do allow
names taken from certain fantasy novels to be registered.  The
criterion is that names are acceptable if they were used by humans in
an alternate Earth, rather than by non-humans or in a
post-technological or otherwise obviously non-Earth planet.  Thus,
Tolkein names are allowed if they do not imply Elvish or otherwise
non-human birth, names from Kurtz's books are allowed.  Names from
Darkover or Pern are not allowed, although many are actually real
names, and are permitted if otherwise documented.

Names are returned as offensive if they would be so considered by a
substantial portion of the SCA.  Examples of offensive names are John
Nunraper and Peter Hitler.  I think the point requires no further
elucidation.

Names might be deemed to imply a claim to rank if they use the surname
of a ruling dynasty (Egbert Tudor, Fred Romanov), if they combine the
given name of a period high noble with the name of his demesne or
capital city (Louis de France, Vratislav of Prague, William of
Warwick), or if they use a form which implies office or rank (Henry
Marshall of France, David MacLeod of Dunvegan).  Names might be
considered to imply non-human birth if the given name is one
documented only as a non-human name in period (Dylan, Llyr, Gandalf,
Grendel).  

These explanations are not exhaustive, nor are they authoritative, but
they do give something of the flavor of the rules.

====================================

Some questions for discussion:

Do you feel that the College should register and protect names?  If
we do so, we must do it on a Society-wide basis, since SCAfolk have a
tendency to move often, and to travel widely.  What level of
protection do you think is reasonable?  For example, if a household
name is registered, what protection should it be given?  What about an
order name?  A group name?

If we register names, should we require a minimum level of
authenticity?  What do you think that level should be?  It has
generally been the opinion of the College and of many others that the
purpose of the College is to educate on medieval heraldic and naming
practice, and that therefore we should base our requirements on
reasonably concrete standards of research.  Should we require more
stringent standards for groups and orders?

How do you feel about names which imply non-human nature?  Would you
be offended, for example, to encounter a gentle at an event who called
himself Anaron the Elf?  Grendel the Fierce?  Dafydd of Darkover?
Colin MacLear?  Bran of the Raven?  

====================================

Feel free to expand this discussion to include other questions.
Please do, however, try to separate discussions of armory, as opposed to
names.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts, and will be saving the lot
for future review.  I thank you, and am always your friend & servant,


	Arval Brigantia.

Greetings to all!

I am heading an inter-Kingdom project for which we need programmers.
We want to develop a good data base package for maintaining Kingdom
Orders of Precedence.  The program must meet the following criteria:


	- It must be highly portable.  We anticipate writing the whole
	  thing in standard C.

	- It must be well-structured & well-documented so as to be
	  easily modifiable.  Different kingdoms have very different
 	  needs, and we want to allow for maximum flexibility.

	- It should be developed on a standard home computer.  IBM PC
	  or Aple II would be best.  Mackintosh is possible, too.

Anyone interested in working on this project should contact me
directly.


I thank you.

An "iomar" is really an "ionar". It is a vest like garmnet for the men. It has

in my humble opinion. This way you can embroider some celtic knot work on them

no way to put "real" sleeves over the lenae. The sleeves of the lenae are
BAGGY. I could hide a cow in mine and no-one would ever know ;-)

A note on the ionar. You should be wearing one if you are a male scotsman!! A

Greetings!

I would much rather not have this discussion: it is boring and a waste
of the elctrons it takes to distribute it.  However, since so many
seem intent on continuing it, I will state my postition.  Danulf and
others worked very hard to set up an SCA newsgroup.  Any proposal to
modify the current setup must be to create a more easily accessible
SCA newsgroup.  No offense intended, but I have no interest at all in
other living history groups, and I thuink much of the discussion we
have on alt.sca would be wholly inappropraite on a general medievalism
newsgroup.  I don't think that groups devoted to such topics are a bad
idea: indeed, I would probably read the latter.  However, an SCA
discussion forum is too valauble to lose.  

At this time I have seen no good reason presented to change the
current setup.  If Danulf's system managers comes screaming to him
that he is using to many resources, then we can change.  Until then,
relax everybody, and let's talk about the SCA, nu?

The East Kingdom age requirement of 18 for all participants in combat or

enforced at Pennsic this August.  The only exception will be for
emancipated minors.  

The same rules will apply this year as for the last year for minors at the

	I'd like to second this name.  So far I've heard of only two 
reasons why this work, and one why it isn't totally appropriate.  The
first is because some sites do not get rec.foo, and so some people 
would like to have it as soc.foo (or even comp.foo, but we'll laugh
politely and move on).  The second is it's too long a name.  The reason
that it is inappropriate is that this group proposal is prompted by the
traffic generated by SCA mailing list and alt.sca, and there is a strong
measure of support for an SCA only group.  There is also the (dis-?)advantage
of having a newsgroup that actually says SCA.
	In an ideal structure it would probably look like 
rec.living-history.org.sca, but that's *way* too long. (Or maybe even:
rec.living-history.medieval.org.sca, but now I'm probably getting silly...)
	But, all in all, I think that there is enough to talk about in
a rec.medieval.sca or somesuch to justify a group solely for sca related
discussion.

"last"?  This is the first time I've heard this name mentioned.  But then
I hear rumors saying that the sca-on-the-net movement started over
in soc.culture.something last fall, something which I missed, so it's
hardly surprising that I might have missed previous name suggestions.

I feel this is Yet Another Good Name, and entreat current voters
to change their votes if they feel likewise.


To answer Matt Crawford -- uh, big deal if I mispelled a couple of
things.  Followups-To: and Followup-To: are very similar in concept
as well as in spelling, and means nothing to my abilities to run
the system here.  But be that as it may, this is not a proposal
for a *new* newsgroup, but for the change of an existing name.
Regardless of what you think, the alt distribution is *not* part
of the mainstream Usenet.

Unto Lady Catrin, greetings from Siobhan Medhbh O'Roarke.
 
I am the Society Chronicler, so I may be able to help. Also, the
Pikestaff staff read these messages, so you may get a direct
response from them.
 
Currently the Pikestaff is arriving on time every month at my
home in Michigan. I get a first class subscription. If your
roommates' copies are arriving and yours are not , I suspect a
problem with the Registry.
 
Make a photocopy of a past label from YOUR pikestaff, or your
membership card if you don't keep old Pikestaffs. Send it to the
office of the Registry, explaining the problem. It may be that
you have moved, and not paid for periodical mail to be forwarded
(in which case your membership may be suspended if any mail was
returned to the Registry). You may have expired, and need to be
renewed. Or there could be other problems.
 
Please, when you send this letter to the Registry, send a copy to
both me and the Pikestaff editor, so that we can keep track of
these problems.
 
If you have other questions, please feel free to post them. I try
hard to respond promptly.

I also agree with the idea of rec.living-history.???. My intrests are not with
the SCA (You SCA'rs are to old for me!!) but with buckskinning (from around the 
1830's-40's). The rec.living-history.??? would give all of us that re-create a
historical period a newsgroup to use for our time period. Lets get all of us 
"old-timers" together on this one. I'm sure between the SCA'rs, Civil war buffs,
Buckskinners, and Revolutionary War Buffs that we could get sufficient interest 
to create the newsgroups.

Sho' nuff m'lady.

First, I am assuming that you do not access this forum through Usenet,
but instead in its form as a mailing list.

Briefly, the newsgroup version is in an "unofficial" place.  That is,
there are 7 newsgroup hierarchies which are "official" and are officially
promoted and enjoy the widest distribution and so forth.  There are
a few other hierarchies which have been created but each has specific
purposes and none have as wide a distribution as any of the official
hierarchies.  The one which the sca newsgroup currently inhabits is
known as "alt" and was meant to be an alternate to the mainstream
hierarchies.  It was started as something of a revolt from the people
who run the main hierarchies, and in practice is closely related to
the main ones.

The main difference of the alt distribution (hierarchy) is that there
is NO discussion involved with making newsgroups.  People merely create
them at will.  In the main distributions there is a long and arduous
process by which one must create newsgroups.  In short you must prove
the need, decide on a name, conduct a poll of the readers to determine
if there is interest (30 day voting period, there must be >100 more
yes votes than no votes), and so forth.  Part of conducting the poll
is to publicize it in the proper places...

>What you are trying to do
>Whom it will effect?

It will affect us, the readers of sca@lc.mcs.mit.edu/alt.sca.  Hopefully
it will change the name of alt.sca into rec.org.sca or some other similar
name.  One effect is that as a mainstream newsgroup it will reach more
people than it can hope to under the alt distribution.  In the votes I've
received so far there have been 2 or 3 ALREADY saying they cannot get
the alt distribution.

>What effect will it have on anyone's current arrangements

Other than the name change nothing of any significance.  We might talk
the mailing list gateway-er at Berkeley into installing a second gateway
there, which will improve dispersement of the articles.  The current
gateway is at Ohio-State, more or less on the east coast.  Having
a gateway on the west coast will better serve people there.

>What Criteria are you selecting for in the name--

>If the name is, is it appears to me to be, of burning interest only to those

You are more or less correct.  The name is to be fit into a list of names
which is currently around 400 long.  There are 7 categories as I hinted
above, as follows:

	rec	Recreation oriented groups.
	soc	Social oriented groups.
	sci	Science oriented groups.
	news	About the Usenet system itself.
	comp	Computer oriented groups.
	misc	Groups which don't fit well elsewhere.
	talk	Groups which by their nature are never ending talk fests.
		This is where the politics and religion groups live,
		for instance.

Anyway.  As near as I can tell, and I consider myself an expert (maybe
an expert in training) on Usenet, the only use for the newsgroup name
is to give a broad delineation of discussions which will take place
in the group.  One can think of each group as a "club", like a chess
club.  At a chess club meeting the talk will mostly be about chess,
but the conversation WILL wander off to other subjects from time to
time.  The same happens in the newsgroups.

The name should both help a user looking through the list of newsgroups
to find the group they want.  Also the name should be helpful in cases
where you're telling someone to "look over in that newsgroup", so that
everybody knows what sort of place they're talking about.

Each of the factors you mentioned above are present in some of the
existing newsgroup names.  The most important are brevity contrasted
with memorability and fitting well into the existing name structure.

The experimental part is that I am trying a slightly new procedure
which is designed to reduce some of the pain.  In recent history there
have been 2 or 3 hotly debated newsgroup proposals, the debate centering
largely around the name.  That is one of my concerns ...


Hope this helps...

        David

Subject: small note on armor dents

I agree that the level of force necessary for a killing blow should not 
be high enough to regularly dent armor.  A major problem with hitting 
with that much force is that when armor dents, the force of the blow 
has been absorbed by the armor, not transferred to the person inside. 
(this is what it's for)  However, this can lead to a shocked crowd of 
onlookers who think a fighter is unchivalrous for not counting a 
blow that was strong enough to dent armor, when inside the helm, the
fighter didn't feel it.  Normally there are other indications such
as the sound and the blow feeling 'odd' that will make a fighter pause 
to find out what happened, but i think this is yet another reason to
keep calibration below the dent-level.

Message-Id: <320@dcscg1.UUCP>



The more I think about it, rec.living-history.??? would be an excellent
newsgroup for all of us that re-create a specific time period. As a start,
we could just try to start rec.living-history without specific sub-groups.
By only starting one group, it would be easier to generate sufficient votes
to start the group. After the group is established, we could divide into the
specific time periods. I'm sure we could get support from the SCA, Buckskinners,
Civil War groups, Revolutionary War groups, Museum groups that operate period
displays, and others interested in history. I also think that after splitting
the group that one general group should remain (rec.living-history). This group
could have topics that would be of common interest to all involved in living-
history. It could include topics such as :

           Storage and preperation of foods
           availability of materials for clothing
           problems associated with time-period camping
           crafts that overlap from diffrent time periods

Lets pull together on this one. How about comments from EVERYONE THAT IS
INTERESTED IN RE-CREATING A PERIOD OF TIME. WE COULD ALL BENIFIT FROM THE
CREATION OF THIS NEWSGROUP.

Here in Ohio, we consider this less on the east coast. I guess it's
probably something to do with the nearly 1,000 miles between us
and the ocean. Not only that, but we are logically as close to the
west coast as the east; Ohio State is a backbone site with
7 major connections, widely scattered across the country, including
the west. In fact, we have a secondary name server going in San Diego
(just in case Ohio falls into Lake Erie and we still need to tell
the world where our machines used to be). In short, both your
geography and your reasoning seem to be a little off. We're not
on the east coast, and the physical location of a well-connected
backbone site is irrelevant anyway.

Subject: Newsgroup names and the purpose of this forum


Wlinden/Alfgar asks that we create a newsgroup that incorporates all the 
medieval organizations.  

Now I will say that "some of my best friends are from MSR or Markland or..."
but,...  when I started this digest/distribution-list (which has grown beyond
any of my expectations) it was meant for the *S*C*A*.  I do not wish or desire
to exclude members of any other group... but the main purpose of this group is
to promote ideas/views/conversations amungst SCAdians.  

I would strongly oppose including a newsgroup that was for all "medieval
re-enactment groups"...  I like the Marklanders and MSR... but truely do not
want to discuss their corporate policy here.  If they have a willing volunteer
to start and maintain a distribution list/digest/or newsgroup, I will give them
whatever assistance and support I can for them to create their OWN group.  In
the end, I *do* have the final say-so.  SCA-DIGEST will not gateway a 
rec.medieval newsgroup...  of course, my opinions have been shouted down 
before, so if enough of think that this stance is wrong, please feel free to 
say so by writing to sca-request@mc.lcs.mit.edu or to the address above.

If a newsgroup is formed for the SCA, it should include "sca" in the name.

I started the discussion on collective nouns by pointing out that according to
the Book of St. Albans, the people posting to this newsgroup constitute a
"sauegard of posters".  I even worked out, to my own satisfaction, a plausible
derivation for the phrase.

A more careful search through the OED, however, reveals that all the clever
theorizing in the world isn't as useful as being very careful not to misread a
single blurred letter:  Would you believe "a safeguard (spelled 'sauegard') of
*porters*"?

I suppose the modern equivalent would be a roadblock of trolls.

Subject: Re: A newsgroup proposal -- rec.org.sca
Message-Id: <5353@dasys1.UUCP>

I make a (last?) plea for rec.medieval. The SCA is not the only group devoted
to this activity, and it would be inappropriate to have a newsgroup 
confined to one particular organization, just as "rec.sports.baseball.
americanleague" would. I have been offended by MilitiaMMMobsters directing
snootiness at us, yes, but surely we are not to descend to that level?
 (If I thought it had any chance of passing, I would hold out for rec.
living-history.medieval, so groups from other milieus could find an approp-

Subject: Re: Re: Fighting BS (uh, i mean Blow Strength :-)

I am writing in reply to Mr Townsend's reply to my posting.  In what follows
please take things in the most constructive manner; i'm not mad at anyone,
and have nothing personal against Mr. Townsend, non-fighters, Ansteorre,
Houston (well, it is kinda humid :-) or anything else.

Mr. Townsend's posting shows to me an uninformed opinion of fighting.
The phrase "will probably be obvious to the most unskilled observer" in
relation to blow strength is the tip-off for me.  I certainly believe that
if 8 gauge armor gets dented (my teeth grind just at the thought) even
people in the West would be inclined to intervene if the blow were not taken.
The problem is that there is a whole range of blows that do not damage the
armor but are still too hard.  Any fighter knows this, as only someone on
the receiving end can.

A fighter also knows the impracticality of the breakaway armor idea.  Armor
that is designed to *stay together* fails all too frequently; if the armor had
to fall apart at the "right" blow strength we would never get through the day
if more than five fighters showed up at a tourney.  Also the idea of measuring
the depth of a dent, and that the dent is "easily hammered back out" is simply
ludicrous.   One would need a portable anvil of some sort, and spare parts for
the eventual time when the part simply failed.  This also implies fighting in
armor that has been stressed and is "by definition" suffering from metal
fatigue, a bad idea.

Both of these points show simple lack of knowlege, but this is *very easy*
to fix; just go to fighting practice for one month.  In that month anyone
can acquire a lifetime's worth of sage expressions, good stories, and
impressive-looking drills, and that's without even putting on the armor. :-)
Fighters love to talk about fighting, and most like to teach.  I claim that
even a minimal one-month exposure would have given Mr. Townsend a better
idea of what is going on and what all the shouting is about, and that the
resulting posting would have been *much* harder to refute, based as it would
have been on at least some experience  :-).

He then states that heavy list fighting cannot possibly be re-created without
risking injury to all participants.  This is just not true, but again without
having been in the armor on the field Mr. Townsend has no way of knowing this.
The swords have to be a certain weight and density or they don't behave like
"real" swords (boffers just don't make it as re-creation), but it is *not*
necessary to dent armor in order to get a perfectly adequate "feel" of the
situation.

As for the moral superiority of fencing, let me just state that the fencers
in the East are complaining about rising calibration levels for the "piercing
touch".  It won't be long before the fencers of the Known World have to deal
with precisely the same issue that the rattan fighters are now.

"Heavy weapons, by definition, requires [sic] the armour to be defeated by
a blow."  This is true, but i don't see why this is a point against rattan.
Fencing also assumes that the armor is defeated; how else does one get
stabbed?  The implication is that the armor must be *destroyed*, or somehow
damaged or physically altered in order to register a blow.  This might be
nice if there were a convenient way to do it, (but see my previous comments
on armor), but it is *not necessary*.

In conclusion, let me state again that i'm not mad at anyone.  I just want
to correct what i think are mistaken impressions of rattan fighting.  As
someone who has done it for many years, i know that there are problems.  I
also know that i personally have derived a great deal of benefit, both
physically and (dare i say it?) spiritually.  And, (pause to climb gingerly
onto soapbox), You Can, Too, if you try it.

Until next i spout forth, i am,

P.S.  The following paragraph had nothing in particular to do with the rest of
my posting, but i couldn't stand to throw it away.  Lucky you.  :-)

I have always been taught that the "standard" armor is chain mail, and that
the "standard killing blow" is defined to be that which would cut/pierce
chain mail, in the opinion of the recipient.  This is "supposed" to be true
regardless of what the fighter is wearing, whether carpet or full plate.
The reason for this is to "democratize" the lists, so that someone who can
afford full plate does not have an advantage over someone who can only afford
carpet or leather.

Subject: Re: Pensic War Introduction/Checklist Offered -- Here it is!
Message-Id: <672@galaxy>


	First off, I'd like to thank Bart for posting such a useful list.  I 
am a veteran of exactly one Pennsic, and I wish I'd had something that 
coherent to refer to when I was madly preparing last year.  Luckily, I got 
lots of useful advice from other folk who were seasoned campaigners, so I 
didn't forget anything vital.  I'll be using Bart's list as my core reference 
this year.  What follows is one set of what will doubtless be many additional 
suggestions for surviving Pennsic; I'm drawing on my vast experience here :-)

1)  Get enough sleep, especially before you go.  Unless you are one of those 
lucky people who can run on very little sleep and not be affected, you will 
have to deal with some problems when sleeping at Pennsic.  Most of the 
campground is open fields; shade is scarce.  By 8 AM at the latest, the tent 
that was an icebox the night before will be an oven; you will wake up with the 
sun whether you want to or not.  The obvious solution is to get to bed early, 
but that can be well nigh impossible between the excitement and the noise made 
by 5000 people (not to mention the drumming).  Tent walls are thin; people 
outside will sound like they're right next to you (because they are).  Resist 
the temptation to socialize all night, every night, and make sure that you 
arrive on the scene well-rested, and you'll have more fun, as will those who 
have to deal with you. (Last year, I spent the weekend before frantically 
making garb, getting packed, etc., then drove out at night, arriving when it 
was too hot to sleep.  I spent much of the War frazzled and exhausted.  I did 
manage to enjoy it enough to do it again this year, but it was a near thing.)

2)  If you can afford it and pack it, bring extra shade, such as a tarp or 
dining fly.  With a little bit of planning, you can set these up to give your 
tent a little extra cool time in the morning, and you can make all sorts of new
friends who will collapse gratefully in your shade during the hot part of the 
day (getting rid of them is your problem).  Sewing dags onto the edges will 
make them look more medieval (the tarps, not your friends).

3)  Something to sit on (be it a chair, cooler, or whatever) that is YOURS is 
a good thing.  I get tired of sitting on the ground after a while; being able 
to claim your own chair or whatever when you want is very nice.

4)  Bring sunblock, especially if you're one of those people who "usually" 
doesn't need it -- you will.

All for now, until I think of some others.  (Thanks again, Bart!)

Subject:      Biceps

Unto the honorable Lord Harlech -- I find my self not in disagreement
with you, but would suggest that the 2 categories you mention of
karate schools are the same as the 2 I enumerated, merely stated from
a Shotokan perspective.  I wish all of us good hunting for the second
variety, both inside and outside the SCA.  On the matter of biceps, I
must emphatically disagree -- one need not be a Peer, or even have an
AoA to win Crown List, and winning Crown List is the only method of
establishing the Crown.  I do admit (as I stated) that it has not been
a bad system in use (witness the good Kings and the multiple Peers).
I would gently remind of the "bad" Kings, in which I include those who
have given Patents against the wishes of the Order as well as biased
elections into Orders by favoritism.  We have only 2 actual defences:
voting with our feet for the 6 months of the reign, or attempting
to appeal to the BoD (.....!).  Until chivalric behavior itself
becomes a criterion of victory (witness the Tournament of the Lions in
the Barony of Bjornsborg, Ansteorra), the urge (even if not usually the
actuality) to win at all costs will remain.

Once again (with apologies), I will vacate the sapbox -- err, soapbox.

Greetings!

This past weekend, Eastern Crown Tourney was re-fought in the Shire of
the Black Rose.  The new heirs to the Eastern throne are Master Randal
of the Dark and Katherine Stanhope.

20 fighters entered the tournament, which was restricted to those who
fought in the previous tournament and who were eligible to fight.  The
tourney was notable for the courtesy, chivalry, and good humor of all
the combattants.  The other finalist was Duke Mogan Sheridan, who
therefore now bears the title Admiral of the Armies.  The
semi-finalists were Sir Manfred von Halsstern, defeated by Prince
Randal, and Sir Horic Grarvargr Caithness, defeated by Duke Morgan.  

In addition, this has to have been to funniest Crown Tourney I've ever
seen.  The collection of accidental trick shots, bloopers, and side
comments by the fighters kept everyone in a light mood.  The award for
the Most Creative Blow goes to Prince Randal, who took Sir Manfred's
leg in the semi-finals, then tried to kill him with a thrust to the
chest delivered between his own legs!  An award for Lightest Virtual
Calibration goes to Viscount Edward Zifran of Gendy, for commenting
from his knees to the fighter looming over him with a clear shot at
his back, "I'll give it to you if you don't hit me."

   I haven't had this (athol brose) for years.  I took a course with, I

like the Gundestrup Caldron and read the Tain bo Cualigne and stuff like
that.  At the end we had a party, and athol brose was served (among

I have found a cure for them empty (E-)mail box blues! I have recieved a

printer ready version, just edit off this intro. Those of you who asked for
one of the other versions, I am sending those out by mail. If you feel you
must edit this, feel free to add your name, but I think it stands on its
own.

As a flame inhibitor, I make no claims that this is the be all or end all,
nor do I claim to give advice on major trauma. If you see either in this
paper, you are adding it yourself. I did not mean to put it there. (How's
that for a paranoid disclaimer?)

If you have a problem with backspace characters on your printer, you are
going to have to edit this, since I tend to use bold and italics
(underlines) when I want to make a point. Sorry.

       Having recently come  into  possession  of  a  copy  of	the
       original	 issue	of  this  missive (I lost my last copy more
       than three years	ago!), I felt it was about time	 to  update
       it.  What  follows  is a	list of	useful things to have along
       when campaigning	in the wilds of	western	 Pennsylvania.	For
       ease  of	 reference, the	list is	broken into three sections:
       that which you need, food, and  that  which  might  come	 in
       handy.  I  have also added a section on things to be wary of
       (see Section 2, _W_A_R_N_I_N_G_S_)_, but don't let	this scare you off.
       These issues are	meant to alert and instruct so that you	may
       better enjoy the	War.  While the	original was  targeted	for
       Pensic  XII  (back when it was a	week-end war), it is useful
       for most	camping	events.	Add more of any	item as	you see	fit
       for longer periods.

       Before getting into the list, I would like  to  emphasize  a
       climatological  fact. The area the War is held in is part of
       the Great Plains	weather	pattern. This  means  the  area	 is
       subject	to  some  disturbance at the leading edge of a cold
       front  _(_a__1_5__t_o__4_0__d_e_g_r_e_e__t_e_m_p_e_r_a_t_u_r_e__d_r_o_p_)_.   Friends  from
       the East	(and West) Kingdom have	variously referred to these
       as _m_o_n_s_o_o_n_s, _t_y_p_h_o_o_n_s and _S_t_o_r_m_s__o_f__G_r_e_a_t__F_e_r_o_c_i_t_y__a_n_d__N_o_t_e_.
       Those  of  us  who  grew	up in the Midwest call them thunder
       showers,	except some folks I know from Kansas  who  call	 it
       mild  rain  (No	twister	 and it	did _n_o_t	flatten	the crops).

       winds (50 plus knots), heavy rain, and spectacular lightning
       and  may	 be  followed by several hours of rain.	 The people
       who grew	up with	the weather do not ignore the storms, these
       folks  respect  and plan	for the	weather. The fronts seem to
       roll through every six to nine days in August.  I advise	all
       to expect it.  It is unpleasant,	but need not be	a disaster.

       Another,	more subtle climate fact is the	average	temperature
       and  humidity  in August	is horrendous during the day, while
       the nights can be down right cold.  (Can	you say	 _f_r_o_s_t?	  I
       knew  you could.)  Day time high	temperatures average in	the
       high 90's with humidity to match.  If you are  not  used	 to
       this,  or  are  not  in prime condition,	_t_a_k_e__i_t__e_a_s_y_.  More
       fighters, and spectators, are lost to heat  than	 all  other
       types  of injuries. Folks who are used to desert	heat are as
       likely to drop as any, the high humidity, which they are	not
       used  to,  slows	heat loss via sweating.	 If the	temperature
       and humidity get	high, drink lots  of  water,  stay  in	the
       shade,  eat  fruit  (especially	bananas),  and occasionally
       taste metabolite	replacement drinks (while Gator-Aid is	not
       the  best,  it  is  easy	 to get). If the Gator-Aid does	not
       taste bad, drink	up until it does, you are in trouble.  (How
       is that for rough and ready sports medicine?)

       The climate of the area can also	 lead  to  another  problem
       encountered  at the War,	hypothermia.  This is a	drop of	the
       core temperature	of the body, which can	lead  to  coma	and
       death  if not treated. Treatment	is to warm the person up as
       quickly as possible. It is easier to  avoid  hypothermia	 by
       changing	 out  of wet clothes, drying off, and getting warm.
       If a friend is wet, say after being out	in  the	 rain,	and
       getting	cold,  since  the temperature dropped 30 degrees in
       the last	hour, help them	out. Get them into dry clothes	and
       get them	warm. Strong drink is not advised if they are still
       wet or cold, while they may seem	to feel	warmer,	 it  speeds
       heat loss, which	you are	trying to avoid.

       The last	point I	will hit moves from cold back to hot,  i.e.
       fire.  This  wonderful  tool is like any	other, it will turn
       and bite	you if you mishandle it.  The  Chirurgeonate  would
       like to mandate a minimum of 10 feet between open flames	and
       tents. I	wish them luck,	common sense is	hardly common.	The
       rule  of	 thumb	I  use	is far enough away so that the fire
       cannot be knocked into the tent,	 and  _n_e_v_e_r  have  an  open
       flame  in a tent.  Lanterns in tents are	an issue I will	not
       address except to point out I use battery  lamps	 in  tents.
       Most modern fabrics melt	too fast and too hot for me to want
       to take chances.	 As for	campfires,  if	you  are  not  good
       friends	with  Prometheus, be _v_e_r_y careful. Amateurs make me
       nervous,	and there are very few sterile sheets  on  site	 to
       wrap burn victims.

       The following should _n_o_t	be left	at home:

	  +o Sleeping bag and pad. You can always  bum  a  place	 to
	    sleep,  but	 you  ought  to	have something to sleep	in,
	    even if it is just a couple	of blankets. This area gets
	    into  the 50's on _w_a_r_m nights. This	is no joke. The	pad
	    can	just be	something to  keep  you	 off  of  the  cold
	    ground; a thicker pad adds to comfort immensely.

	  +o Change of clothes for the time spent plus two,  wrapped
	    in plastic to keep dry. If you do not have extra socks,
	    you	will need them,	and there  is  nothing	worse  than
	    getting clean and then having to climb back	into dirty,
	    sweaty clothes. While washers are available, it is best
	    not	 to  rely  on  them, unless you	_l_i_k_e hanging out in
	    laundry-mats.  It is a good	idea to	have at	 least	one
	    change of mundanes in your vehicle,	in case	all of your
	    clothes on site get	soaked.

	  +o Rain gear. Rain  coat  or  poncho,	boots  for  mucking
	    about, wool	socks, plastic tarps. While a heavy, somber
	    toned poncho most resembles	an oil skin cloak, use what
	    you	 have.	Better	safe  than  soaked;  I	have  found
	    mundanity is accepted when it is bucketing and you	are
	    holding down a tent	(especially someone else's tent).

	  +o Hat. This gets a separate item because it is important.
	    Besides keeping the	rain off, a hat	cuts body heat loss
	    in the cold	or at night and	keeps the sun from  boiling
	    your  brain	as quickly.  Sun stroke	and severe sun burn
	    can	be a drag.  The	hat should  be	mediaeval  looking,
	    but	 that is a lot of lee way.  All	oriental hats, many
	    straw hats,	and some leather cowboy	hats look right.  A
	    note  on  hat etiquette:  remove your hat in buildings,
	    tents, or even shade; as well as being polite,  wearing
	    a hat out of the sun is almost bad for you as no hat in
	    the	sun.

	  +o Warm cloak (or a  friend  that  has	 one)  or  a  plain
	    blanket  that  can	be  worn  as one and can be sat	on.
	    Again, the nights get _c_o_l_d and the	dew  falls  heavily
	    even (especially) after the	hottest	days.

	  +o Garb. This _i_s an S.C.A. event, and some attempt  should
	    be	made  to  dress	 in  period  as	much of	the time as
	    possible. Mundane costumes are fine	for under armour or
	    for	 going into town, but you might	get complaints even
	    then. The following	should suffice:












				  - 4 -



	      1.  One or two simple tunics or dresses in some light
		  colored solid. These should be some natural fiber
		  that	breaths	 well  (e.g.  cotton,	linen,	 et
		  cetera),  as	light  as possible while preserving
		  modesty.

	      2.  A warm costume or over-tunic (to pull	on  over  a
		  light	tunic, layering	is very	effective) for cold
		  nights or days. A solid colored cheap	 velour	 or
		  heavy	 trigger work well for this, as	both have a
		  high polyester content and do	not breath.

	      3.  One good or semi-good	outfit for court, going	 to
		  the  taverns,	or visiting the	campsite of someone
		  you wish to impress. If the costume in item 2	 is
		  well made, it	will do	admirably.

	      4.  Light	shoes or sandals, unless you want  to  slop
		  around  bare	foot.  Be warned, the gravel on	the
		  roads	is sharp.

	      5.  Accessories. A belt with a pouch  and	 knife	are
		  good things to have around.

	  +o Portable light sources, both for camp and  the  port-a-
	    castle.   Authentic	 if  possible,	but a hand flash is
	    sometimes more convenient. If you use propane lanterns,
	    be	aware  that they are bright. They can hurt the eyes
	    of those of	us who adjust well to the dark and  provide
	    quite  a  show  if	used as	out-house illumination in a
	    plastic port-a-castle.

	  +o Toiletries.	The  usual  stuff,  and	 don't	forget	the
	    shower gear.

	  +o Money to buy fresh food, fire  wood,  drink,  trinkets,
	    instruments,  garb,	 armour,  art, or whatever else	you
	    can	not live without.

       Eating during the War is	a problem with	several	 solutions,
       pick  one. If the weather is typical (hot), you may not feel
       like eating much. Do not	give in	 to  this!  Drink  lots	 of
       fluids  and  force yourself to eat fruits and easy to digest
       protein during the day. This way	you will have enough energy
       to  eat	carbohydrates  and  other difficult to digest foods
       that you	need when it cools off at night.













				  - 5 -



       The first option	is to supply yourself. Bring  most  of	the
       food  you need, and get the rest	either from the	Cooper's or
       from a store in town. Yes, town.	 Butler	is 15 miles east on
       422  and	 New  Castle  is  10  miles west. There	are grocery
       stores, state stores, and beer distributors in both  cities.
       There are also department stores, in case you need something
       else, like a new	tent.  (Mine blew up in	a storm	 one  year.
       That's right, not down, up. The front blew right	off, I have
       witnesses.)

       The second choice is to join a food plan. There are  taverns
       on site that charge a set price to feed you for the week, or
       many groups do their cooking together.  For  information	 on
       how  the	local group is doing things, ask at commons. If	you
       do pool resources, I advise cash	in advance  and	 an  agreed
       upon  work schedule. People resent someone who appears to be
       free-loading.

       The third method	is to catch as catch can. The taverns  open
       for  general business after the folks who have pre-paid have
       eaten or	there are  people  wandering  around  selling  food
       ("Bagels	 and  cream  cheese!"  "Here,  over  here,  my good
       man."). There are even some folks willing to feed a waif	who
       wanders	by  at	meal  time.  This  latter  may	be the most
       expensive choice	of this	most expensive method.

       What follows is a list of things	that are handy,	but may	 be
       left out	if you do not want (or cannot afford) to overburden
       yourself.

	  +o Armour. This is not	mandatory, unless you want to fight
	    or scout. There is still lots to do	without	fighting. I
	    know a couple of  _k_n_i_g_h_t_s  who  have  just	left  their
	    harness  at	 home  and  relaxed  at	a War (O.K., so	one
	    marshalled a couple	of times and the  other	 was  doing
	    his	thing as a Laurel).

	  +o Eating utensils. What type depends on how you  plan	 to
	    eat.  If you are taking care of yourself, you will also
	    need cooking and clean up gear.

	  +o Swim suit and  towel.  Many	 folks	skinny-dip  at	the
	    swimming  hole  but	a) I am	not skinny, b) the water is
	    better at the state	park down the road,  and  c)  I	 am
	    shy.

	  +o A tent or tents. An	extra tent  allows  more  room	for
	    storage  and  hospitality.	 While	pavilions are nice,

	    modern tents are acceptable.

	  +o Coolers are	always welcome.	They  also  can	 be  packed
	    with gear during travel.

	  +o Plastic jugs of any	 size  for  water  and	mixed  soft
	    drinks.   Canned  and  bottled  drinks  are	 good,	but
	    powdered Gator-Aid and Kool-Aid are	cheaper	 and  easer
	    to pack.

	  +o Extra and/or fancy garb.

	  +o Camp lights. Kerosene torches, candles  with  chimneys,
	    hurricane  lamps,  or what ever. They give a campsite a
	    nice look  and  keep  people  from	literally  tripping
	    around.

	  +o Fan. It may	not be 100 degrees in the shade, but a	fan
	    is still "a	good thing."

	  +o A bottle opener, can opener, and/or	cork screw. I  have
	    seen people	offered	peerages for these things.

	  +o Books and games in case things get slow.

	  +o Bandanas, Band-aids, bug spray,  hatchet,  jack  knife,
	    rope,  string,  sewing  kit,  safety pins, and anything
	    else that is handy in camp.

       This is not a complete list, nor	should it be taken as  one.
       It  is  a start based on	10 years of War	experience. I still
       tend to use my old  Boy	Scout  manual,	I  just	 substitute
       "garb" for "uniform" and	go. If you forget or do	not have an
       item, you can probably obtain it	on site	 or  near  by.	The
       main thing to remember is to have fun. See you there!

Uh, if someone is denting 8 gauge steel, I don't think I would enter
the list against them.  I think it takes excessive force to dent 14
gauge, much less 8!

In order to judge whether a blow is good, I need to be able to feel
where it landed and how much force it was delivered with, which I can
do through my armor.  Based on this information, I can determine if
a blow was good.   There is no need for me to have my bones broken or
even be brusied.

This would be an aesthetic disaster!  Aluminum just does not look like
iron.  Also most fighters won't pound the dents out of their armor.
A number of the top quality Eastern fighters do not wear full plate.
One I know wears a judo gea!  Two others wear (chain) mail.

There would also be safety problems.  There is NO WAY I am going to
give up my 14 gauge steel helm.  Except for a 12 gauge model :-).  This
also aplies to my gauntlets, elbows, knees, kidney protection, that
place you can't scratch on television, shoulders, etc., etc.

I wear 55 lbs of armor to make my self invulnerable, not invincible.
Besides, it looks good.

I don't think the way to handle someone who is not taking blows is to
strike them harder, rather it is to talk to them after you have both
cooled off.  I would not expect them to agree with me, but after six or
eight people have said "My lord, I think you are over-calibraited.", the
message will sink in.  The same applies to hitting too hard.

Subject: Fighting - training vs winning

In reply to the letter from His Excellency Baron Seamus McCryu-McHoo:

Unfortunately you neglect to mention two other types of martial arts schools.
The first is well meaning but insidiously detrimental to the arts and their
practitioners.  This type of school tries to live by all of the cliches of the
martial arts they have read about in cheap paperbacks, but these people have
not trained long enough to have gotten to the core of training.  These schools
are invariably too friendly and one finds people using first names and
traditional reishiki (etiquette) being given lip service if it is seen at all.
Unfortunately the results of this training are both obvious and predictable;
its products can sometimes look pretty (to those without full understanding)
but are invariably shallow and lacking in focus.  This is what I think of when
I read the letter His Excellency wrote.
    The other type of school encourages anyone who can make a full and complete
commitment. "Naturals" seldom do well here.  They are used to succeeding easily
and don't want to put up with the agony needed for real understanding and
development.  Personal development - we call it forging the spirit - is the be
all and end all of training, and yet it is still possible to win against real
opponents because real technique properly applied always wins (even against
natural ability).  Anyone who is willing to give his all can succeed in this
school because of the ability of the master-instructor to train a wide variety
of individuals.  Victory is achieved by defeating the self.
    This second type of school is just as rare in the SCA as it is mundanely,
but it DOES exist and can be found if you look hard enough; and if you don't,
they don't want you anyway.
    As for selecting our kings by the size of their biceps, I ask you to
consider the number of Royal Peers with Pelicans and/or Laurels.  Winning a
crown takes intelligence and planning.  Sure, exceptions occur; no system for
selecting leaders EVER works very well.  But I submit that the present system
is far better than the political chaos and hatred any other system would
create.
    Moreover, I resent the implication that only those with the "win-at-any-
costs" mentality can win.  Most of the Royal Peers I know are among the most
worthy and honorable of gentlemen I have ever met, in the SCA or mundanely.

Subject: A newsgroup proposal -- rec.org.sca
Message-Id: <9825@g.ms.uky.edu>

Greetings gentle beings in the entire civilised world.  I am known by
many of you as David (E-Mail Hack) Herron.  But am also known to a
small (but growing) number of you as David le casse' (Broken Dave), an
itinerant scholar fro France (but also partially of English heritage)
from the early 1300's.

[Note the followups-to header, restricting followups to news.groups
 and alt.sca.  Readers in int-fiction or culture.misc who are moved
 by this posting are urged to either read followups in one of those
 two groups or to add something to the discussion stream and to
 include their newsgroup in the followup.  I felt each newsgroup listed
 to have *some* interest, but that only news.groups and alt.sca should
 have any continuing interest.  Also I wish to apologize for the
 length of the posting but when I went back through to midievalise
 the posting it lengthened enourmously!]

I am bothering all you wonderful beings because it is now time to
consider upgrading alt.sca to a real newsgroup.

We have numerous and sundry onerous considerations to undertake
before it can be seemly and proper to create this newsgroup.
(Oh how much easier these things are when you do not have to
undergo such strenuous thought to just get simple things done,
ah well when in the net do as the netters do).  Let us proceed
before the enormity of the task overwhelms oneself!

The first consideration to make is interest and traffic.  I think that
it is safe to assume there is interest in the newsgroup, as shown by
the latest arbitron posting.  It has reached 48% propogation and
handles more traffic than many real newsgroups.  Also in the early days
of the newsgroup and mailing list there was enough traffic going
through AI.AI.MIT.EDU to cause stress and strain to the very
foundations of that poor li'l ol' computer, and prompted a move to
MC.LCS.MIT.EDU.

I do not know how 48% after two months compares to the normal
propogation growth news groups.  But when previous arbitron showed a
35% propogation Brian indicated to me that was about normal for a
mainstream newsgroup and a high growth rate for an alt group.

The second thing to consider.  And what frightful subject it is to
consider!  The name.  Only two good names have come to my mind, they
are:

	rec.org.sca	The Society for Creative Anachronism
	soc.culture.sca	The Society for Creative Anachronism

Both names fit current newsgroup practice.  In the one case as a
recreational organization, and in the other case as an example of a
culture.  My personal favorite name is rec.org.sca, but can understand
that some people may object because of the fact that there is no
currently existing rec.org structure.  To which I say that there is
precedent for a .org structure under the comp hierarchy, one which
means exactly what I intend to mean under the rec hierarchy.  The
soc.culture.sca name occured to me while considering what to do with
gentles who were insistent against rec.org.sca but generally approving
of the idea of an sca group.

The third consideration is fairly straightforward, that of other
related newsgroups.  The only other related group which I could find in
the current newsgroup hierarchies was rec.arts.int-fiction.  While I
haven't read that group I believe they mean computer based fiction
rather than face-to-face interactive fiction as we do in the Socity.

The fourth and fifth considerations have already been covered
sufficiently what with the creation of the mailing list, the alt
group and whatnot.  Specifically considerations about the subject
matter and value to the network.  Subject matter can be seen
for ones own eyes by merely subscribing to the newsgroup.  We
talk about dealings related to these current middle ages.

As for the value to the network.  As anybody who has attended any
number of society functions can tell you, technical people make up
roughly half of the people of the society.  There seems to be a common
thread among technical people which draws them to Science Fiction
fandom, the SCA, and other things of this sort.  This has been dealt
with many times before in many other forums, with very few successful
conclusions I might add, so I will not attempt to solve any of these
thoughts at this time.  I merely want to use these well known
observations as justification at this point.

Now for the final task.  About the vote.  I am going to try an
experiment with a different format for voting.  Voters should fill in
the following form when mailing their vote to me:

	rec.org.sca	_____		(yes/no)
	soc.culture.sca	_____		(yes/no)
	no to both	_____

The idea is to allow you to vote for either one of the names (or
both if you don't care which name), or to vote no completely.


*****************  DO NOT POST VOTES, VOTES SEEN IN THE NEWS
*****************  WILL NOT BE COUNTED.  ONLY ONES RECEIVED BY MAIL!

It should be childs play to get mail to me, but we'll probably find
someone who can prove me wrong.  Childs play because we are directly
attached to both BITNET and ArpaNet as well as the UUCP network.  Childs
play because we have been known to the UUCP network for almost
4 years now, to BITNET for 2-3 years and the ArpaNet for over a year.


A tie of yes votes will cause rec.org.sca to be selected.  As for
the yes/no delta, it will be calculated in the normal way.  The number
of voters indicating yes-ness minus the number of no voters.  I will
also attempt to weed out duplicate voters, so that I can gain some
experience with that problem.

If there is a great hue and cry about how I'm not following the rules,
well I'll back off and convert it to a more normal vote for either
for or against rec.org.sca.  I am just interested in seeing how a
procedure like this can work out.


That is all for now.  Voting starts right now as of Midnight
on July 3 and will end at Midnight on August 32  (30 days)

Saith my brother:  "If your armor gives, then the blow was too heavy."
Of course, they do heavy weap. w/ 8-12 gauge steel.  He fences in
mundania, once he moves to Houston he may start up light weap.

Which brings me to my neighbor who does light weapons -- any blow that
might be "too heavy" will probably be obvious to the most unskilled
observer.

Well, I personally feel that heavy weapons are really hard to
recreate without someone getting hurt.  Fencing et al. are based
on a "piercing touch".  A good thrust would kill or wound, with saber
a good swing.  Heavy weapons, by definition, requires the armour
to be defeated by a blow.

Suggestion:  go to breakaway armour and softer weapons.  Say light
gauge aluminum that bends easily and softer weapons.  Denting
the aluminum 1" = a killing blow, and it's easily hammered back out
after the fight.

> The above is mostly addressed to the fighters among you; how about the rest?

I'm a non-fighter.


Enough for now.

Subject: celtic garb (yet again ;-) )

    My reason for agreeing that kilts weren't worn about the home
    is that the things represent a good chunk of the adverage
    person's wealth, and are horribly in the way for field work.
    I had the opertunity to try to clear a camp in a kilt and 
    leyna, and it was absolutely no fun.  I eventually took 
    the kilt off, and worked in a leyna.  I would imaging 
    herding would be possible, as the kilt would be used as
    a blanket in the hills much as it was used as a blanket
    at home.

    Quick run down on celtic garb (I wish I knew a graphics
    language other than postscript...)

    Ionar -- the celtic jacket, very short waisted, typically
             V necked, with a 6"-10" pleated skirting.

    Leyna -- the Irish war shirt, a floor length shirt with
             large bag sleves which are usually pleated or
             gathered along the top.  It is worn belted up
             so that the hem is above the knees, and double
             belted.
    
    Kilt --  18 ell X 60" piece of plaid, pleated and belted
             at the waist.  It is worn so that it has a tail
             of pleated cloth.  It typically is double belted
             and has several "pockets" folded in.  [ I have
             seen translations of an elle from 9" to as much
             as 40", but I don't know how to sort the regional
             differences out to get a "period" figure.  My
             experimenting with length indicates that 10-12
             yards is a good campaign kilt length, which 
             provides a good blanket as well as keeping one
             warm in high rain and wind.  I'd guess, though that
             is all that is, that period kilts ranged from 
             5-6 yards for boys of 12 up to about 15 yards 
             for richer portly men. ]

    Brat --  A shaggy rectangular cloak, the predesessor
             of the kinsale cloak of the 18th centuary.  The
             details of the weaving of the shaggy wool for
             kinsale cloaks can be found in the Folklore pattern
             for the kinsale cloak.

    Bog dress --
             nickname for one of two styles of women's dress.
             I don't know the actual name, unfortunately.  It
             is a closed bodice dress, with external side lacings
             and a gathered skirt.  The name comes from the
             fact that they keep turning up (on their wearers)
             in Irish bogs.

    Irish dress --
            nickname for the other style of women's dress.
            Same problem, I don't know the name.  It is a 
            front lacing bodice, with attached skirting.  The
            front gaps by about a hand.  This form is richly
            documented in surviving drawings.

    Arisade --
            Woman's variant on the kilt. My experimenting
            (on various girlfriends ;-) ) indicates that
            a good length is about 8 yards.  It is pleated
            as a kilt, and worn so that the bottom is at the
            bottom of the skirts.

    All celts wore leynas as undergarments (Highlanders, 
    Islanders, and Irish -- I don't consider Eastern and
    lowlander Scots to be celts... ;-) ), and brats on rainy
    days (all the time ;-) ).  Irish man wore an ionar, and
    usually trews.  Highlanders wore ionars, and may have 
    worn trews, but I am not sure.

    Women wore the bog dress, and there is ample documentation
    that an Irish dress was worn over that.  In the winter,
    a fur lined Irish dress was worn over that.

    Colors were yellow (from saffron), red (from madder),
    blue (our old friend woad), brown (from many sources),
    green (also from many sources), purple (from a lichen
    in Ireland, very expensive, and from laying a blue and
    red thread next to each other on the loom), and black
    (from a mud, several walnut based dies, and natural).

    Materials were linen, wool, and leather.  It seems that
    the wool wasn't dyed purple, but that is from a Faire
    source...  The Irish were some of the best weavers in 
    Europe during the 15th and 16th centuary, selling over
    seas.  The Scots has definitely lesser weaving skills.

    Neither the Scots nor the Irish were into keeping their
    heads covered all of the time.

                                 In service,

Greetings again gentle!  A thousand pardons for intruding yet again and
so short a time following my previous intrusion yet I felt it was
important.  I have decided to make a slight change in the experimental
procedure which I'm using for this vote.

If one has a different name to suggest than the two which I provided,
feel free to suggest away.  You will still be counted in the positive
and your vote will be listed under whatever group name you suggest.
The voting summaries will reflect all this as well.

A name which has been suggested already is simply rec.sca.  While I had
considered that name at one time it seemed "wrong" somehow.  One of the
criterion I am operating under is that if a newsgroup lends itself
to having newsgroups placed UNDER it then it belongs at the top level
of a hierarchy.  Also if a newsgroup naturally fits under a hierarchy
then it belongs there.  While it is true that a rec.sca could have
groups placed under it, I don't see the volume in the group growing
to enough of a level to make subdivision necessary.  But, on the other
hand, it naturally fits somewhere under an org hierarchy.

Which brings me to another group name -- soc.org.sca.

All of which is interesting in light of the recent comp.women debate.
Not only can I not think of a perfect place to put THIS newsgroup,
I keep thinking of new & good places to put it.  Sigh.

Hi there.
 
I saw an SCA fight demonstration at Darkover con.  It looked like
fun, so I decided to sign up.  Unfortunately, school work prevented
me from following up on this.  Now that it's summer, I have the time.
Contacting the Seneschal in this barony (Princeton is not Settmore
Swamp, but I don't remember the name it is). And he agreed to
send me relevant info. At some point during the conversation,
he asked what about the SCA I was interested.  I said fighting.
He asked what else.  Unfortunately, I have no idea what the other
options are.
 
As I said, he promised to send me info, but, given campus mail, I
will be lucky to get stuff before the summer is over.
 
Any info on the SCA in general, and on Princeton area stuff in
particular, would be most appreciated.

You can read it here, and other places too.
A brat is a large, originally rectangular cloak much loved by the Irish.
The upper edge, especially near the neck, was usually thickly fringed.
The Book of Kells shows simple versions. Late period drawings show shaped
cloaks with deep fluffy hoods. One authority claimed that both the hood
and the fluffiness were part of the weaving but I did not see her sources for
this assertion.

> and is it true that the Irish worked in the fields starkers,

Doubtful, although many people refer to the celts lack of modesty. Think about
it for a moment. Work clothes are there purely to protect the skin from the
work. Field work is usually, merely, dirty and so the skin does not need to
be protected. The other need is to protect from the elements, in which case
you probably want to avoid field work.

The irish were also noted for herding cattle and horses, occupations which
suggest trousers rather than skirts. There are hints in the Book of Kells to
indicate a style of tight fitting pants.

Finally the kilt.
	1. The scots came from ireland.
	2. Being sailors and irish I suggest that they wore a belt outside
	   their brats to stop them blowing away and otherwise getting in the
	   way.
	3. Finding Scotland colder than Ireland they made their brats longer
	   and thicker and called them kilts.
	4. The real point in question is had the scots abandoned their
	   Irish bases before or after the Great Kilt became recognisable.

Tricky subject.....well perhaps ;-)

My research agrees with John. The style of dress he describes here is 
accurate. Although I don't know about the great kilt not being worn at home,
I will say that it is a comfortable piece of clothing!!! It may take forever
to pleat, but it is very versatile. 

I think that the biggest point to keep in mind here is that clan tartans did
not exist yet in the 16th century. Plaids were not clan specific and were
generally earth-tone colors!!!

If anyone needs more information on this subject, E-mail me. I think I have
some patterns and literature around here somewhere.

I have never seen any documentation to support the claim for the Irish
great-kilt. With all the drawings, carvings, and what-not one would
think if they used the kilt, even if just on campaign, *especially* if
on campaign, there'd be records, as you said there were by the English
for the early Highland great-kilt. (Pardon my english)

As far as pleating the things up, my experience is that it takes a
*long* while the first few times, but with even the little practice I
have had (I think I have pleated mine up, oh, maybe a dozen times now)
it gets faster. I am sure if it were an everyday garment it wouldn't
take long at all - already I could get dressed up in my great-kilt
much faster than my wife could get ready for church!  *\:-) Of course,
you have to have some room. A friend's experiences of pleating it up
in a pup-tent is not one I'd care to share, but fortunately we have a
big tent.

I don't know why the great-kilt wouldn't be suitable for, say, plowing.
My understanding was that it was all-around dress. Could you explain?

Subject:      Fighting/training vs winning

As has been much written lately, the stick-jock issue is producing
much verbiage.  As I see it, this seems to be following much the
same pattern as was seen in the evolution of the Karate tournament
scene.  Consider the following thesis: Karate schools break into 2
largely separate classes: a) those interested in winning and displaying
large numbers of trophies, and b) those interested in improving the lot
of their fellow man.  Now enter one of these schools as a slightly less
than gifted person -- what will happen?  In the trophy school, you will
be discouraged (either actively or passively) from even attending since
you consume valuable time and space resources better given to the
"naturals" who make and keep the school's reputation by winning.  This
type of school actively selects OUT those who most would need the
training.

Now let us consider the second school.  One usually finds these in
university gyms (the run down one, not the new one -- i.e. a club,
not a varsity team), or in Park and Rec departments or some such small
hole in the wall.  The teacher tends to emphasize personal advancement
overany absolute standard of advancement, and so feels it his/her duty
to teach those of us who are not "naturals".  This school will rarely
win large numbers of trophies since the philosophy is not on winning
but on doing well and improvement of character.

In the SCA, we elect our Kings by the measurement of the biceps.  While this
is not necessarily bad -- it does lead to a win at all costs mentality.
I would argue that in service of the DREAM, we look more towards the
second ideal, and less towards the first.  In other words, ethics and
morality (read CHIVALRY) over escalation to win.

Enough hot and rarified air :-)

Subject: Scottish Highland Garb

        This is a tricky subject, and as far as I know, the
        documentation is limited at best.  The culture wasn't
        literate, nor was it inclined to portrature, which poses
        interesting problems.  My research indicates that the
        great kilt was in use by the 1530's, but that is based
        on the accounts of battles between the Scots and English.
        The primary western Highland and Isles dress followed the
        Irish norms (ionars, leynas, and brats), with regional
        differences, primarily in embroidery and weaving styles.
        The great kilt was worn in both Ireland and the Highlands
        on campaign, but not about the home (this I don't have
        any primary documentation on, but the Irish and Scots
        at the LHC'c Renn Faire have been loudy proclaiming this
        for several years, and I have no reason to doubt it.
        It makes a certain amount of sense, as the damn things
        take quite a while to pleat, and wouldn't be suitable
        for plowing the fields in.)

        The Irish kilt seems to have been a herring bone twill
        or plaid, as was the Scotish kilt.  There are several
        surviving plaid fragments from the Highlands from as
        long ago as the 1000's.  The oldest fragment I have
        found reference to was used as a seal in a jug which
        was recovered from a bog (of course...).  The women's
        dress was mostly the same as the Irish, but the
        Eastern highlands were very different.  I have no
        no documentation on that area, as my persona is an
        Islander, not a Highlander.

  I couldn't agree with you more on your discussion of blow strength.  My own
personal view on the matter is that I am out for the fun of the sport.  I 
have tried to always use the term "defeating blow" over "killing blow" 8->
but I have been known to backslip when referring to a mass weapon 8-< .

  I also have been known to take lighter blows for the same reason, I don't 
wish to be pulverized by the brutes 8->.  Also, there are some shots that are
so pretty that you just have to give credit to the deliverer.

  It's so much more fun for the spectators of a tourney if all of the players
on the field are out to have fun more than just win (nothing wrong with 
winning however!) because then we all avoid the bothersome mutter of 
"ironsides", whether or not its true.  My lady wife, on the other hand, went 
for a different way to avoid tourney boredom.  She decided to fight too!  Her
first tourney was this weekend (6/26).  She said she had never had so much fun
at an event.

So long and hello from the Outlands

paragraph thus completely destroying the line of the argument. The complete

abused

people who claim that they do not fight heavy list because of hear-say

necessarily, anyone at all) that there are fighters, and knights, and, yes, 
knights marshall who hit too hard, who believe that a blow, given or received, 
is not good unless it hurts, and that people who don't like pain (especially 
women who don't like pain) don't belong in the lists.  I don' know if such 
people exist, but the rumors do, and the result is that many people who do not 
like pain are cut off from the one activity that is both central and universal 
to the entire SCA.

And the results of that include:

	The flourishing of rapier (which is good) and with it the 
proliferation and exaltation of out of period personae (to the detriment of 
the shared medieval experience).

	The unending upward spiral of blow-strength and armor standards (the 
increased cost of equipment oneself, especially the start-up cost, resulting 
in the exclusion of more potential fighters).

	The ignorance of non-fighters of things fighting.  One immediate evil 
consequence is that it is difficult to impossible for ladies to judge, as it 
is their duty to judge, the courtesy of the fighters, and they are obliged to 
rely on showy gestures such as giving up a limb which, although they can be 
strong indicators of courtesy, do not lie at the heart of chivalry.  Another, 
whose dangers are less manifest, but which may ultimately prove more damaging 
is that tourneys are *B*O*R*I*N*G*.  If I cant look at pretty fighting and

The previous incarnation of this message apeared in the digest in a badly 
garbled form with several lines missing, and the line of argument completely 
destroyed.  It's my fault, im sorry , i'll try to proofread more carefully in 
the future.  The complete, and, i hope, correct text follows.

My appologies also to Milord Eoin, whose words i have taken out of context and

In medieval times, this may well have been true (see, however, my letter in 
digest 29, where I pointed out that dying as a matter of course during a 
tourney is probably not period (counter examples, anyone?)), 
but to apply that argument to the current middle ages is to imply that being 
cut in two or feared are good things and I am not convinced that this is so.

Most fighters would, I think, be content to have their ribs broken, and some 
would draw the line before then.

As for being feared and respected, I don't think any one is afraid of me, uh,
 that is, I don't think anyone is afraid of me on the field, and I'd just as

Subject:      Arts Competition


(I am posting this for someone who lacks network access.)

EXPERIMENTAL ARTS COMPETITION

The Dominion of Myrkfaelinn, a group within the Eastern Realm, has
recently run an experimental arts competition in an attempt to find a
form that overcomes some of the common complaints about arts comps.  We
thought other SCAjuns might be interested in the results, since there
has been some discussion of these points.

Our competion was based on the idea that the artisans themselves are
best able to judge their own work fairly.  We set them to discuss their
work, each of a pair of artisans coming to an agreement about which of
them had presented a better piece of work in that round.  They were
allowed to show different works in different matches.  Rather than
employ a complicated scoring system, we just let each artisan argue in
turn until one had confessed his work inferior in two rounds.

The contestants in this experiment were Ursula von Moenchwald CM, L.
Alix d'Amiens, Miguel Garcia, Orlando Alvarez, William MacKeown,
Niccola Sebastiani OL, Master John the Pell, Alys Gardiner OL, Gryphon
du Forte Epee OL, L. Vittorio Maria del Fabbro, and L. Suppililiumas of
Gongor.  Roberto suprised us all by showing up, but, as he told William
when he appeared, he was "just there to argue the tiring rounds."  We
were pleased to get so many top artisans, though.

Maister Johnny lost both the first two rounds, although he presented
a respectable devotional print (albeit lino, rather than woodcut).
Just not his day.

Suppililiumas made a very poor showing with a SCA-legal pole weapon as
sole entry.  He reached the third round only by virtue of having gotten
a bye in the second.  The tiring bout was very short.  The Maestro said
to him, with the genial courtesy he always displays, "So tell us, my
lord, the name of the historical weapon which this polearm represents."
Suppililiumas opened and closed his mouth several times, but never
made a sound.  His defense failed utterly.

Vittorio also fell out early.  His bout with Alys in the first round
was a spirited one, as he compared his 1470's Italian costume with her
contemporary French garb.  Both displayed touches of brilliance in a
clean match which was a pleasure to watch, but she finally attacked his
documentation (which *was* weak) and finished him off.  He matched
helmets with Alix in the second round, but was clearly outclassed.

Miguel looked OK going into the tourney, but was clearly put off his
stride in the second round when Niccola walked into the forum and
attacked his documentation with a sneered, "You get that from Marvel
Comics?" and as soon as he gave up, turned on her heel and left
without acknowledging her opponent further.

Orlando was pretty hot until the third round when he met Alys with wood
turnings.  His juggling pins just weren't up to her Nuremburg double
cup, then he lost again to William next round arguing armor.  He's a
good, solid artisan, but he doesn't have the killer instinct.  Maybe
he'll be sharper the day he decides he really wants to win.

Gryphon only lasted into the fourth round, too, but he didn't have much
popular support.  In the first round he had agreed to argue with Alix
on illumination, but when he showed up in the forum, he had his trusty
wooden mousetrap.  Alix never quite got it together after that and
played an almost purely defensive game.  It wasn't clear why he had
made the category switch and it didn't seem to have done him much good.

William MacKeown was clearly the rising star of this tourney.  His work
was well-made and well-documented and he defended it with vigor,
displaying an active, but clean, offense, winning most frequently by
attacks to authenticity.  He really is a one-art man, but his opponents
did not seem to profit much from watching his early bouts.  Niccola was
the exception, handing him both his loses.  Their second bout was
really  bad.  She exploited the weaknesses he had already displayed,
especially his failure to internalize medieval esthetics.  He got off a
couple hard shots at her documentation which I would have thought good,
but she shook them off.  Of course, nobody but the artisan is really
qualified to judge his work, so you can't say anything.

Ursula looked pretty good.  She made it to the semi-finals, together
with Niccola and Alys.  Somebody asked why we had ended up with all
women going into the semis and we reveiwed the competition, but found
no evidence of bias.  In the arts, anybody can get to be a top
craftsman if he is willing to devote the time and effort to it. That's
what I like about the arts.

Alys had a great day.  Experience pays, of course, and she had argued
with most of her opponents before, but she was still amazing.  She cut
through their defenses like butter, tossing references right and left,
answering every challenge to her skill like the great artisan she is.
I don't think anybody but Niccola could have stopped her.  We were kind
of surprised when she put Niccola in the losers list, in the fourth
round, arguing woodworking, but she seemed unbeatable.  Niccola put up
a better fight in the finals and they were pretty much even right to the
end.  Of course they know each other's tricks and that dragged things
out a bit.  I really think it was Niccola's stammina in arguing that
decided the competion (not to mention her dogged determination to refuse
to accept criticisim which might well have crippled a lesser artisan).
There was also a rumor that she had some special reason for wanting to
win this comp, but I never heard the truth of it.

Alys and Niccola each took two of the final matches (five same-arts
bouts) and left cooking as the last argument.  I would have guessed
Niccola would have brought along confectionery of some kind and Alys
baked goods,but their previous arguments led to a suprise, since they
had discussed some recipes from *Guter Speise* a couple of weeks ago
and both of them appeared with an interpretation of the same recipe for
*escargots*.  What a slugfest!  It was a real inspiration to the
craftsmen who were there to watch two such great artisans slapping
one another's work arround like that.  Alys argued strongly from
translation and Niccola based her offense on culinary possibilities.
Alys made a couple of attacks that Niccola had to stop and think about,
which always looks kind of bad, but she went on debating.  In the end
it seemed like Alys' wind just gave out.

We were pretty pleased with the results of our experiment and are
thinking of trying it again, maybe with a couple of modifications, but
no radical changes.  We would be glad to hear from anybody else who
tries this arts comp form at one of their events.

From the Society Master of Arts and Sciences: The Rattan
Project Lives!
 
I am pleased to announce that the ongoing study we have referred
to as "The Great Rattan Project" has now moved into its second
major phase. Now that we have completed our library research into
the physical and botanical properties of rattan, we will now
begin testing rattan samples to determine empirically just what
it is about rattan that makes it so well-suited to use as a
weapons material in the SCA. Once we know this we can test still
other materials to determine if they, too, might be safe to use.
 
To do this we are going to need to test a whole lots of different
rattan samples, so I'm asking you to donate rattan to us for this
purpose. Rattan samples should be atb least 18" long. We will
also need to know for each sample how old it is, or at least when
you bought it. Where you bought it (eg, "Hack-n-Slash Armoury" at
TYC or "That Guido chap in the grey pin-stripe at the corner of
Merchant's Way and the Great Pennsic Highway at Pennsic 16") is
also important. If you know where the rattan actually came from
(ie, the importer, etc.), such as the Hoboken Rattanworks on
March 18, 1988, please let us know. The more detail you can give
us the better, but please don't fake it. If you're not sure, just
say so. Retired swords and other weapons may also be useable.
 
Rattan donations can be sent to me (Jonathan E. Feinstein, 180
Plymouth Street, New Bedford, MA 02740) or to my Deputy in charge
of the rattan project, Sir Gerald Thomas FitzGerald (David
Fitzgerald, 2471 Filmore Street, Salt Lake City, UT 84106). We
will probably also have an area where donations can be made at
Pennsic 17, probably in the Barn or at Herald's Point.
 
We need all the samples we can get. Please Give So It Doesn't
Hurt! (grin!).

Subject: Dance get-together at Pennsic

I've mentioned this before, but now it's time to get a little organized.

I'd like to put together some sort of Dancemaster/mistress' get-together
at Pennsic. This isn't intended to be a gripe session, nor a critique of
peoples' dance styles, nor an argument about whether particular dances are
or aren't period. This is a plain and simple Dance Swap, for people to get
together and trade dances, so that the various people around the Known
World have a little more idea about what their compatriots are dancing.

I'm not going to limit it to practicing Dancemasters, but I'm
primarily looking for people who will spread around the dances that are
being taught. Musicians are also welcomed, especially since I suspect that
we aren't going to be able to get the Barn (ie, electricity for Magic Music
Machines). You don't have to be willing to teach to come (although the more
the merrier). You *should* be willing to get up and learn, though.

This has the potential to be a lot of fun, and educational for all 
involved. Are people interested in participating? Talk to me if you are;
I need to start figuring out details like *when* we can do this, what is
going to be taught, and what kind of equipment we'll have available. Tell your
local dancemaster, and send me a note if they're interested (or if *you*
are).

In service to the Society (and its multitude of feet),

Warning:  following note is rather long.  This is because it is
the result of long-ruminating thoughts on my part, and not
(merely) because I'm long-winded.  Other disclaimers to follow
text of my comments.


      I note that a number of comments lately in these pages ...
umm... make that bytes... have remarked upon that most central of
SCA topics, "how far should we go in being period?"

      I think this is a wonderful topic, since it touches on why
we do this nonsense in the first place.  My position on it is
that we are doing this first, last, and most of the time in
between, because we enjoy it.  Therefore, I stand firmly in favor
of making some compromises that do not add to the "periodness" of
these activities.  On the other hand, there must be a definite
limit to this, or else we won't be re-enacting anything at all.

      Limiting cases provide some guidelines in this respect.
Safety is one area in which we cannot question any anachronistic
approaches.  In armor, this is a frequent conflict, and I haven't
heard anyone disagree with (or even bemoan) the safety-first
approach necessitated by insurance considerations.  In similar
light, as Shava pointed out (in digest 30 -- note appropriate
footnoting),
>           Coolers may not be period,
>but on the other hand, food poisoning is...

      The SCA has encouraged enough historical research on the
part of an overwhelming majority of its members that probably
none of us would really want to live in the Middle Ages, even if
we could.  I take a permanent stand _against_ re-creating the
Black Plague, Inquisitions, peasant life, salty food, etc. etc.
Except perhaps tongue-in-cheek, but even that sometimes makes me
uncomfortable.

      On the other hand, as I pointed out earlier, the opposite
extreme removes the point of our doing any of this in the first
place.  Kentucky Fried Chicken doesn't belong at an SCA event.  I
would like to suggest that the appearance is more important than
the details.  This is a game, in a sense, and I think we would
better enjoy playing it if we spent more time trying to act and
speak with chivalry than chastising each other for, e.g.,
(hidden) zippers in garb.

      The benefit of this approach is that, in my opinion anyway,
it saves the best of both extremes.  The details are not lost,
since there are still other people of like interests to discuss
(going back to my last example) the period accuracy of one's
garb.  Visible zippers could still be discouraged, since they
affect the appearance.  In a like manner, the "everything inside
your pavilion is `period'" attitude commonly held is a perfectly
acceptable one (I insist on brushing my teeth before going to
bed, Middle Ages or not).

      This also takes into account the effect of the attitude
fostered by one's actions.  It has been pointed out to me (by my
mundane brother, Richard DeLacy of Carolingia--Boston) that
having a concealed zipper in one's garb is comparable to
discussing computers at an event, an infraction that large
numbers of us both bemoan and commit on a regular basis:  It may
not harm the event for someone who doesn't hear it, but it does
tend to produce an attitude that will detract from the atmosphere
in the long run.

      This approach I am describing still has a number of
problems with exactly where to draw lines between what's
acceptable and what's not.  My personal view is that this can be
solved by allowing a middle ground that is acceptable but
discouraged, officially -- unofficially, it would probably work
out as "agreeing to disagree."

	Sounds like he made it out of sanded rattan (no husk.)  

Lady Brigid,
	In my experiance this is neither common nor good practice.  
While the tip does travel the fastest of any part of the blade, in 
practice it also does not land as effectively.  In my experiance the
proper point-of-percussion on a sword is the area approx. 1/5th to 
1/3rd the way down the blade from the tip.  Blows with the very tip
can sting, but they don't land a solid blow, leading most fighters
to call a tip shot as if it were light.  There is some reason for
this, a shot with only the tip contacting would not likely be fatal,
as would a blow landing from the upper-central part of the blade.
	Last, striking with this portion of the blade can be hazardous.
If the tip is squared off the result should it impact on a less-than-
fully protected area can be quite painful and result in a deeper
and nastier bruise, something we really should avoid more...

	Here-in lys the difference between the West and the Known World
as I have fought in it.  In Ansteorra, the Midrealm and Merridies the idea
is that we are reproducing the style of medieval combat in the form of
a sport.  There is no need to use our full strength, or even ussually a
majority of it, as this makes things more dangerous.  If we ever *do*
become a contest of "who can hit the hardest", I hope it is on inanimate
objects, even were my opponent in full plate I fully believe that I could
break his bones with a rattan broadsword were I to use my full strength,
and I know fighters significantly stronger than I.  Holding back is only
sensible if you do not desire to force all to wear plate!  
	The question as answered above is that if we are to reproduce the
fighting we need to reproduce it in all its hazard.  This I find objection-
able.  We can fight safely, and medievally, without excessive force.
Imagine if you will what would happen if a professional athlete were
to take an interest in SCA fighting.  Can you see a pro football player
massing 110 kilos and in good condition swinging hard?  I can.  It's
fightening.  Especially when you consider that perhaps most of our
fighters are not in the best of condition and some are quite small
(Like one fighter on my aquaintance who is perhaps 5'5 and 130 pounds?)

	This is certainly encouraged in the Middle.  All Midrealm
Marshalls are encouraged to 'actively' marshall a fight.  If a blow
was flat but taken, inform the fighters.  If one of them is not
calling blows, stop the fight and find out why.  If it gets out
of hand, order he or she to die after an exchange (to save face.)
Not that this is common.  I know I'm *extremely* hesitant to intervene
in a fight, for the simple reason I know as a fighter that those outside
the armor can't really tell what is happening *in* it.  I'm never seen a
fight called by the marshalls.  I have had marshalls counter act a kill
due to it landing flat (something neither of us realized.)  But I have
seen fights where the marshalls *should* have intervened (including
one where a King present got so angry at the failure of both opponents
to call blows that he stopped the fight and declared both dead!)

	Two problems with this are that some will learn the hard way 
to avoid the problem, and there is not always an easy way to "avoid"
a fighter in a list.  I don't know about you, but I would be extremely
hesitant to ask the mistress of the list to pair me with another fighter
because the one I was paired with hits too hard or won't take blows!
And I don't consider driving someone out of the society a viable way
to deal with the problem.  I do agree that if the problem is a member
of the chivalry that the rest of the chivalry should offer counsel, but
I've only seen this once, back in Ansteorra some 6 or seven years 
ago.  Now part of reason for this is that, hopefully, those we have
as our chivalry should be the last to need to lead an elevation in
blow strength.  The knights I've seen swinging hard swung hard before they
became knights too...

Subject: "Periodness" of Scottish Highland Dress


My Lords and Ladies,

I have been trying to do some research on Highland dress, and have been unable
to dig up much real information on same. The few books in the libraries around
here have generally limited themselves to a few drawings and much speculation.
Sad to say, Christian Hesketh's "Tartans" has been one of the most informative
books about.

From what I've read, the great-kilt did not come into general use until about
1600, with the small-kilt (more or less the modern form) until a century or a
century and a half later (which makes it odd, to me, to see SCA Scots going
about in full modern dress, or something supposed to resemble that). The advent
of the claidheamh-mhor, the 1.5/2-handed broadsword, appears to coincide with
the great-kilt, if I am not mistaken (and seems to have declined more or less
with the great-kilt as well).

The issue of shoes remains a complete mystery to me. Some old paintings show
shoes with large buckles but most are not that distinct on the details of the
shoes. One book mentioned that the Highlanders often wore "unsoled" shoes of
untanned leather bound about their feet. This appears to be a description of
"ghillies", but of course there were no illustrations. I have no idea when
the ancestor of the modern dancing ghillies and the ghillie brogues developed
(nor in fact when the modern shoes developed, either). Women's shoes aren't
mentioned at all!

If anyone has conducted a more successful research into old Highland dress,
I would greatly appreciate either their findings, or pointers to books with
more substance than those I've seen so far.

This is a new one on me. It would seem that a heavy blow would be the most
likely blow to 'count'. Holding back is and can literally be self defeating.
In medieval times, fighters whose blows could drive an opponent to the
ground or hack them in two were feared and respected warriors. Heavier
just means deader. However, if a fighter is obviously abusing his/her
opponents, this is a matter for discussion with the appropriate authorities.

Is this done in the East? It's certainly not so in the West! If there is
a problem with 'rhino-hide' in a fight, the person in question has a
little discussion with the marshals (or head marshal) and the King, Prince,
or whatever local royalty is in attendance. Knights may be used to substitute
for royalty, or for additional input. Nothing is 'enforced' except for
safety problems, temper problems, or technical rules ('anviling', etc.).
The marshals are safety officers primarily, and never referees.

Those persons who continue to abuse the system are usually avoided, and
after a while they tend to correct their faults, or they stop coming to
events. About the only time that this has no effect is when the person in
question is a knight, and is therefore somewhat inviolate. Then, it is the
responsibility of his/her fellow knights to counsel this person.

No disrespect is meant to anyone by this, especially to those holding
the title of Master (by using the term Knight).

Respectfully,
Eoin

A brief question on level of blows --

I was at East Kingdom Crown (part one, that is :-) ) and was told a story
about the fighting there.  It seems that Morgan Sheridan had made a sword
especially for Crown.  He untaped it afterwards.  The top couple of
inches had been frayed to the point where they looked like broomsticks.
He apparently had been using that portion of the sword for the majority
of his blows.

Is this normal?                       -Brigid

Arval left out:
	A blither of heralds
	A garble of heralds

Others I have heard are:
	A crusty of chiurgeons (crumudgions)
	A mess of armour (think about it)
	A practice of fighters
	An exhastion of autocrats
	a skulk of seneschals

A group of us came up with a list of these at a wake once. I wonder if
anyone wrote them down. If I can find a copy, I'll post it.

		Bart the Bewildered
		(I used to be a herald, but I got better)
		Barony of Carillion, East Kingdom
