Subject: Atlantian Crown Tourney


Recent postings on kings remind me I have not reported on this
past weekend's Crown Tourney in Atlantia.  The victor, over a
field of 19, was Earl Sir Barry McFadden, fighting for Comtess
Simone (I'm going to get this wrong, I just know it) du Barjuval (yup,
its wrong.  Close, but wrong)  Barry and Simone were the predecessors
of Michael and Seonaid.



On the topic of unbelted kings -- yes, Michael is currently unbelted,
but that wasn't always the case.  I wasn't here and don't know (or want
to pass on) details, but I know he resigned his belt sometime in the
past.  This strikes me as somewhat different than someone on the
throne that has never been knighted.

Good Gentles, Mistress Niccola Sebastiani has been following the discussions
of the Pennsic War on "The Geeknet", as she calls it.  She had the following
to add to the discussion... Orlando
---
Aside from the question of how the space allocation at the War is going
to run this year, it is time to discuss *who* it is who comes to Pennsic.
Here is the monolog I heard in my game store last week:
"You know what I'm doing this summer? I'm going to the war. It's
down in Pennsylvania. You know, it's a Sca thing. And they fight
with swords and everything. My brother- he isn't really in Sca-
he's going and he's going to take me."

The speaker was a young woman whom I know not to be a member of our local
group and whom I judge by her conversation not to be a member of any
group. I'd just as soon she didn't come to Pennsic. She's going to take
up space and water and time in lines for registration and to get ice
cream and to go to the bathroom. If she's unlucky or stupid she's going
to take up the attention and supplies of our chirurgeonate when she gets
heatstroke or hypothermia or a broken ankle or one of the other
afflictions we deal with at the War. And do you know what she's likely to
contribute to the War to repay us? Five bucks to a dubious "improvements"
fund, the even more dubious pleasure of seeing all too much of her
breasts above a "folk" costume, and free sex for how ever many of us
she's willing to accomodate.

Now, Pennsic is a great place for party time. No one denies it. Everyone
goes to party, one way or another (though some of us party by hitting
each other with sticks and some by talking armor nonstop for five days
and so on). All I want is for Pennsic to be a party *for the SCA*.

There are lots of times when it is appropriate to introduce new people to
the SCA. Local meetings. Fighting practices. Pleasant, laid-back events
where people have time to introduce them around and explain things to
them. We are pleased to meet people new to the SCA and to show them a
good time at these events.

There are also times when you do new people a disservice by taking them
to an event. Events where there is a lot of business, both personal and
official, to get done. Events where people are tired and disinclined to
strike up a conversation with someone neither they nor their friends
know. Events where people have travelled a long way and are anxious to
deal with their friends from far away. Events which are too large for a
couple of people to oversee. Events where unusual activities take place,
activities not characteristic of the usual run of SCA events. Crown
Tournaments. Coronations. The Pennsic War.

People who are very new SCAjuns should not be encouraged to go to those
events. People who are not in the SCA and who do not contemplate joining
should be excluded. I do not care if that means the Tuchux and the
merchants from Ren Fairs and MSR and all kinds of groovy guys from SF&F
conventions and gaming cons and LARPG, much as I enjoy their company
elsewhere. The SCA is not a charitable organization which runs a summer
camp for those folks who are not able to avail themselves of the
pleasures of the SCA year round because they're busy playing some other
game. The Masons do not invite miscellaneous Rotarians to their
conventions.

How do you tell if somebody's in the SCA? Easy. They have a membership
card. Or a TI. Or a kingdom newsletter. Or someone who is identifiable as
a member tells you he saw that person put his subscription check in the
mail. *They are paid members.* I'm willing to give people all kinds of
leeway. I'm willing for them to have $6 memberships. I'm willing for
their memberships to have expired within the previous year. I'm willing
to have minors come in with their parents, even if their parents haven't
bought a family membership. I'm willing to be imposed upon periodically
by jerks who abuse the system. But I would like to have the SCA have a
clear idea that it is a club with members who run dinners and conventions
for each other (even though we call them "events"). We are not a
travelling circus for strangers to gawk at. We are not a travelling
brothel for strangers to take advantage of for a price. Let us make our
large events OUR events and take reasonable steps to ensure that they are
restricted to our members.

Greetings!

Hal Ravn and I are trying to compile some statistics on how many
peerages are given in each Kingdom.  We would like to know, for each
Kingdom, for each of Knights, Masters of Arms, Pelicans, and Laurels,
the following:


How many appear on the current order of precedence?

If the information is available, how many of those were awarded
out-Kingdom, and how many of those are currently inactive?  For
Kingdoms which were principalities before they became indepedent,
"awarded out-Kingdom" means "given by a Kingdom other than the parent
Kingdom, or by the parent Kingdom after separation."

How many were awarded in each of the years 1985 to date?



Finally, for each Kingdom, if possible, we would like to have a head
count of active peers in these orders.  I have the data for the East,
Hal is getting it for the West.  Any other information would be very
welcome.  Please contact me before you start working: There's no
reason to have more than one person working on a given set of data!

The data will be posted to the net once it has been compiled.  I thank
you all.

No real details available.  Does anybody know of this? 

Any information would be greatly appreciated.

      choice, abolishing (hopefully) such a tradition before it could start
      (Trimaris has been a kingdom for how long? 4 years?)  Corrections from
      others in the Kingdom welcomed...

Subject: Contests, cooking, names
Message-Id: <3159@tank.uchicago.edu>

Competitions:     Awilda Halfdane raises the question of whether A&S
competitions are a good idea, and suggests the alternative of something
modelled on a state fair, with almost everyone getting some sort of
ribbon. I was persuaded many years ago that competitions are generally a
bad idea (although if anything could change my mind, it would be Niccola's
creative approach to using contests to bully people into doing things
right); my reasons are given in some detail in the article "Concerning
Contests" in the Miscellany; if there is sufficient interest I could post
the whole article, which is a little over two pages. 

One addition I would make to Awilda's suggestion is to push it a little
farther back. I believe, although I am not certain, that our state fairs
are descendants of the medieval fairs. At medieval fairs, as I understand
it, merchants and craftsmen came to sell their goods; blue ribbons and the
like originated as an endorsement by some local authority (the people
running the fair? the lord in whose land it was held? I do not know enough
of the relevant history) of a particular merchant or craftsman's work. We
could make our fairs feel much more medieval by adopting that framework.
People who wanted to display their work but did not actually want to sell
it could explain that they had nothing for sale at the moment, but were
displaying in the hope of future business. 

Cooking: Looking at the recent Rolls Ethereal (from which I seem somehow
to have been omitted), there seem to be a lot of cooks on the net, so I
thought I would mention a few things of interest to medieval cooks. 

The first is that I have found verjuice. As you probably know, it is a
common period ingredient, generally described as a sour juice from unripe
grapes, crabapples, etc.; there is also green verjuice made from sorrel. I
was in a middle-eastern grocery store looking for something else when I
came across a jar labelled "sour grape juice." I have not yet cooked with
it, but I have tasted it, and it seems to fit the description.

The second is that I have found Dibs--in fact, it was what I was looking
for when I found the verjuice. Dibs is mentioned in ibn al-Mubarad (15th
c.) as an alternative to sugar or honey for making Hulwah (sweets). It
turns out that it is date syrup, and can still be found in middle-eastern
groceries.

The third is that the Miscellany and both volumes of the cookbook
collection are currently available from me. I will have them at Pennsic,
and am willing but not eager to sell them by mail--with the warning that
neither I nor Elizabeth is very well organized, which is one reason for
the "not eager" part. For more information, contact me via EMail.

Names:   With all the recent discussion about registering names, I thought
people might be interested in my my recent experience. When I originated
my persona I was loosely basing it on a Muslim character in one of the
Chansons de Geste (Carahue of Mauretania in Ogier le Danois). I somehow
got the impression that Cariadoc was a variant of Carahue--I have no idea
how. Later, when I started trying to do things more carefully, I came to
the conclusion that "Carahue" was probably not based on any arabic
original, but on similar celtic names--it was simply an attempt at
something a little exotic sounding for a foreign character.   So I asked a
friend who was a professional linguist if he could find me a plausible
arabic name that could have been corrupted into "Cariadoc" by european
speakers, just as Abu Ali ibn Sina became Avicenna to Europeans, or Salah
ad-din became Saladin. He found one, with the assistance of an Arabist
friend of his, and published it, with a delightful frame story explaining
how he had "discovered" what my real name was, in TI many years ago.

None of this presented any difficulty for me with the heralds, since I am
in any sense grandfathered--I registered my arms long before the heralds
started worrying about names. The problem arose when my son wished to
register his device and name--the latter being Patri ibn Cariadoc. The
Middle Kingdom heralds sent the submission back with a small
alteration--it was changed to Patri ap Cariadoc, on the grounds that
Cariadoc was obviously a Welsh name and the Welsh for "son of" was ap not
ibn (which is arabic for "son of.")

It is worth noting that several of the heralds involved know me, and one
of the things obvious to everyone who knows me in the society is that my
persona is Muslim. The heralds seem either to believe that if I have what
sounds like a Welsh name then I am Welsh, whether or not I wear a turban,
or else that what they are making consistent is the name not the persona.
I provided the reference to the TI piece on my name--and they changed my
son's submission to Patri son of Cariadoc. 

This raises a fairly obvious problem for the system of naming. On the one
hand, the heralds would, reasonably enough, like the name to be
historically consistent. On the other hand, what are they to do with
anomalies that could have happened in the real Middle Ages and do happen
in the current Middle Ages? A medieval Muslim certainly could have named a
son after a Christian friend, giving "Patri ibn Cariadoc."  I in fact did
name my son after a friend--Patri is both the mundane and society name of
both my son and his namesake.

The obvious solution for us, and the one I expect Patri will probably
take, is to register as "son of" and introduce himself as "ibn." But
although that evades the problem for us, it does not really solve it in
general.

One further point on the subject of nameing. A number of people have
suggested retaliating against unreasonable restrictions on names by
adopting names that are absurd but legal. The problem with this is that
you are retaliating against the wrong people. Silly names, or names that
sound out of period (even if they are not), make events less real, harder
to believe in as really medieval, for the other participants--it is they
and not the heralds who are being hurt by the retaliation.

Since I seem to have gotten left out of the current rolls ethereal, here
is the information that should have been there:

From: chanson%lucy.wellesley.edu@RELAY.CS.NET
Subject: A modest proposal

What to do about the annual Pennsic land rush, especially the lack of space
left for those who only come a week early?  Why not (warning: rhetorical
question) greatly enlarge the space reserved traditionally for the royal
camps?  That way, the kings can grant camping space in a good location to
fighters who promise to fight for them all war.  Think of the advantages
of the system: 

- it put someone explicity in charge of the space problem, something only
being done for the first time this year, really, and that someone is not
the War Autocrat; saving that worthy another headache;

- it gives the royalty more real power (which is of course what they all
crave :-)), but with it some real responsibility (which they don't have
enough of :-) :-)) as the king can't pass out more space than he has;

- it provides a subtle mechanism to balance the sides at Pennsic, which
makes everything more fun (except the bridge battle), since fighters who
show up later will have to fight for the previously less popular side 
(which has no space left)

- it now makes more difference which kingdom you consider yourself a 
subject of;

- best of all, *it's period!!!*  So what if each advantage listed above
has a down side, has inherent problems?  Kings who need more land to
reward their vassals, divided allegiances, mercenaries who sell their
swords to the highest bidder in land (not just chocolate chip cookies)
- so what, I say, they're period problems!  We're enhancing the quality
of our recreation by bringing back the feudal system.

Actually, as far as the question of multiple fealty goes (this is a
signal that I'm moving from the facetious-but-original part to the
serious-commentary-on-what's-already-been-said part), by the height
of the feudal system, say mid-13th to 14th centuries, it was fairly
accepted practice to swear fealty to more than one lord.  Not necessarily
standard, and the various lords may not have been too happy about it,
but as long as you made your priorities clear in your oath, and made
it clear which lord got what from you in exchange for what, it was
accepted.  (William de Corbie mentioned Enguerrand de Coucy; I will
look up other examples if the discussion continues.)

I did some productive research on the origin of the Order of the
Garter, but then my connection to the net broke down for 2-3 weeks
and by the time I got back on (i.e. now) the discussion is over.
If anyone cares, I e-mail it to you direct.  And if anyone brings
it up again on the Rialto, I'll report here as well.

And as far as speaking treason, remember the earlier exchange in
_Captain Blood_, also between Olivia de Havilland and Errol Flynn:

"Sir, you speak treason!"

"I trust I do not make myself obscure."

What do any of us who just go contribute?  If you are not a marshall,
if you are not a chirurgeon, if you ar not a herald, if you do not do
one of the many tasks needed, what do YOU contribute?

By definition, all SCAdian events are unusual.  (no smilie)  The
specific events mentioned are ones where the magic is the strongest.
It seems mean spirited to try to close these to new members.

I do.  One of the strongest memories I have of last Pennsic was the
doomed charge of the Tuchux when they tried to break the Calontir
shield wall during the bridge battle.  While MSR is not SCA, they are a
splinter group.  The Tuchux try to "recreate" a world which is some
what compatible with ours.  I do not want to see them excluded so the
Pennsic war can be smaller.

A much better radical change would be to make the War by reservation
only.  Only Seneschals can submit reservations.  All reservations must
be paid in full one/two/...  months before the war.  The war autocrat
would know how many people are coming and how large the various groups
will be.  All attendees will have some identifiable relation to the
SCA.

I can see an argument for price differentials, perhaps steep ones.  I
can not see excluding people, just to make life easier for the elite.

Wow, some people are SOOOO polite.  I disagree totally.  Although I
don't think Wars are a good place to bring new people, as there
usually isn't much going on.  i.e. they can get bored to easy.
I don't see this as a problem at Pennsic.  There is a lot more going
on at Pennsic than fighting.

So where do you want us to bring the new people?  Well?  Taking them
to a Crown, or a Coronation, or a Coronet, shows them what a "real"
SCA event is like.  Would you rather take them to a costume making
get together?  A picnic in the park with 10 people?  Fighter
practice?

What do they learn about the "true" SCA at a small activity?  They
can get told a lot, but they probably can't DO anything.  What can a
new person DO at a fighter practice?, besides talk?

Now, from listening to everyones comments about Pennsic, it seems
there are many problems with (site/space/battles/etc) and that more
people may just aggrevate the problem.  But what does that have to
do with new people?  Any solution should involve everyone, not just
a select few.

You want it smaller?  Then don't go, or leave all the children home,
or raise the site fee, or don't let non-fighters in, etc, (many
other silly ideas left out).  Make the merchants buy SCA
memberships.

But, basically, new people are "FUN", they do new things, they have
enthusiasm, they aren't stuck in the same-old-rut.

Well, enough of this, guess I'll stay west of the Mississippi.

Heraldry today deals in books, maps, and other documents on heraldry,
genealogy, and topography.  Their catalogue usually contains books in
many languages, used and new.  They will undertake book searches, but
charge for the service.  They mail out a quarterly catalogue, and an
annual new acquisitions catalogue.  Their prices tend to be higher
than other bookstores, but they are often the only source for many
references.   They can be counted on to carry all the standard
heraldic references: Papworth, Parker, Woodward, Brault, etc.

I've never heard of such a thing available.  There was a program put
out for the Macintosh a year or two ago which contained a small
library of heraldic charges and some discussion of heraldry.  However,
it isn't really very good: the pictures are low quality, and much of
the information refers to modern heraldry, not medieval heraldry.

A number of people have tried to put together heraldic computer
resources: Graphics programs to make it easier to put together a bunch
of designs, conflict checkers, etc.  None of them are done yet as far
as I know.

Subject: Re: Membership and Attendence

Greetings to all, (here I go again)

I fear I must disagree strongly with Mistress Niccols's last message, 
specifically the section about Pennsic being only for paid members.
I have been in this strange collection of lunatics for more than 10
years and it has only been the past 4 years that I have had the extra
money to become a paid member.  I know that there are a lot of people
in this circumstance, who contribute greatly of their time but lack the
extra cash to become a paid member.  I agree that Pennsic is not the event
to introduce someone to the SCA with, but I also feel that to restrict
Pennsic to paid members only would exclude *MANY* hardworking SCAdians
who can barely scrape up the funds to attend events.
Well, enough for now.

Subject: Banishment
Message-Id: <890511002408.18.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

Mundane crimes should be punished by mundane authorities. A rapist or a
child abuser should be reported to the police. But then, the SCA also needs 
some sort of internal justice, concerning membership and attendance at SCA
events. Nothing (short of a long prison sentence) stops a convicted rapist
or child abuser from attending SCA events. The BOD can refuse membership,
but that doesn't stop bad people from attending events. So it seems that
banishment is just about the most powerful tool we have, to get rid of
really bad people.

The only problem I can see with it is that it is not preceeded by any sort 
of trial. It's simply a royal command. This opens up possibilities for 
misuse, e.g. that the king can banish his personal enemies as he sees fit,
wether guilty of crimes period or mundane at all. 

We need to decide wether banishment should be a tool to get rid of bad
people, or wether it should be a less serious, in-period, in-persona thing
by which the king could punish someone for bad behavior strictly within
the SCA system. 

With the very liberal rules for who is allowed to attend events, we need a
powerful tool to keep 1st class assholes away. At the same time, it's nice 
to let kings have the opportunity to rid themselves of persons they find
obnoxious during their reign. It's very period.

I would like to see two kinds of banishment: one in-persona and one mundane.
The in-persona banishment would then be the privilege of the king, to get
rid of personas who have behaved unchivalrously, etcetera, all within the
period setting of the SCA. This would then mean that the person in question
might still attend events, but under a different persona. S/he would lose
any offices held. Mundane banishment on the other hand, would affect the
mundane person and ban him/her from attending events in the kingdom. This
should be decided by a court of chivalry, nothing less.

This spontaneous reaction comes from your friendly neighborhood Norman,

Subject: Membership requirements and new people at Pennsic
Message-Id: <3163@tank.uchicago.edu>

Mistress Niccola raises some legitimate questions in her recent postings,
but I think I disagree with almost all of her conclusions:

1. I agree that Pennsic, and other events, might be more fun if one could
exclude the people who only come to party and have no interest in the
Middle Ages. It seems to me that requiring membership would be a very poor
filter for that purpose--lots of members have no real interest in the
Society (and don't help with heralding, chirurgeoning, troll booth, etc.)
and some non-members do have such an interest. I am not sure that
requiring someone to be vouched for by a member would do much better--I
doubt the lady Niccola describes would have much trouble passing that
hurdle.

A better approach, where possible, is to get people to self-select, by
designing an event that will appeal more to the people you want to come
than to those you do not want to come. Our local group recently ran an
event designed to be low-key but considerably more medieval than events
usually are. We made that clear by the announcement and the seneschal's
flyer. So far as I know, not a single person complained about the lack of
silly contests, not having an elimination list, the pressure to keep
mundane things out of sight, or anything related. I presume one reason is
that those who would have complained did not come. Applying the same
principle to Pennsic is a more difficult problem. My present solution is
self-selection within Pennsic--an in persona encampment where anyone is
welcome who wants to play by the same rules we want to play by.

In general, I think the idea of requiring membership for things is a very
bad one. It confuses the SCA Inc., which is a California corporation, with
the Society, which is a social network of people with common interests.
Someone who has not sent his $20 to the Registrar has not contributed to
the Corporation, but he may have contributed far more to the Society than
someone who pays his membership and comes to events in the belief that he
is now an audience and it is someone else's business to entertain him. 

To require membership for participation is, in effect, to say that the
Board of Directors owns the game and the rest of us must pay them for the
privelege of playing. But the Society was not built by the Corporation
(although the Corporation has certainly played an important role in the
process). It was built by the combined efforts of thousands of
participants over twenty-some years. 

For a longer diatribe on this subject, see "A Letter" in the current (4th)
edition of the Miscelleny.

Mistress Niccola also argues that the war is a bad event to bring new
people to. I disagree. The war is the SCA on a large scale; for some new
people that may be frightening, for others fascinating. 

Vissivald, who is visiting with me at the moment, cites his own "wargamer"
story to balance Niccola's. Vis went into a war-game shop and asked if
anyone was interested in trying medieval tactical. Someone was, so a few
weeks later Vis carried him off to Pennsic IV. The gentleman is still in
the Society. Note, by the way, that Vis's story happened--in Niccola's,
the overheard conversation is real but the rest is conjecture.

Etienne d'Argent writes "But, basically, new people are "FUN", they do new
things, they have enthusiasm, they aren't stuck in the same-old-rut." I
would add that I think it is often easier to get new people to "do it
right" (by my standards of what the Society should be) than old people. To
the new people, wearing costumes and fighting with swords is magical, so,
with only a little effort, they can be persuaded to feel and act as if
they are really in the Middle Ages. For old people, dressing up in
medieval clothes and hitting each other with sticks is what they always do
on weekends--why should they feel (or talk, or act) any different than at
other times?

    The East has had two unbelted Kings.  As far as I know, no one
    ever expressed doubts over Their qualifications for the crown on
    that point . . .

I beg to differ.  The East has had a number of unbelted kings, all but one 
are now Knights:

Fernando
Girth     - knighted during his first reign by the King of Meridies
Bertrand  - knighted 2 years after his reign
Shannon   - knighted 8 years after his reign
Victor    - unbelted still
Hanno
Morguhn   - who reigned TWICE unbelted - knighted at Pennsic XVII


East Kingdom Crown Tournament is this Saturday, in the Barony of Carillion.
Perhaps this list of notable unbelted-Majesties will grow?  Good luck to all
fighting!

    They do not truly know what they are doing.  Thus, it is possible
    that they will drop the shield when they shouldn't, or let down
    their guard.  Even if you wait until the shield is in position
    before throwing a blow, they may still tire, and droop the shield
    unexpectedly.  In this manner, it is possible that your
    (admittedly slow) blow will contact them. 

This is why we call it SLOW work.  I meant SLOW.  Like slow-motion instant

they wouldn't be hurt.  Putting them in armor right away means they are going

Why do we need to put an end to people arriving earlier and earlier?  Why
should be not establish a permanet site for Pennsic?  

The problem with people arriving earlier than other people is that they hog
space by roping off areas for people who might be coming, but who do not show
up.  This deprives late comers of space to camp in.  

And I like the idea of a pemanent Pennsic site.  I dream of a site that has
adequate showers, reliable hot water, flush toilets, pressure inthe showers, 
potable drinking water (I'm one of many people who gets sick on Pennsic water.
I now haul my own.)  All these things I wish for, and more.  Laundry facilities
where all the machines work all the time, and there are enough to go around so
that I don't have to devote my whole afternoon to keeping my place in line.  A
laundry that has chairs to sit on.  Someplace airconditioned where I can 
retreat when all this "back to nature"-ness takes its toll.  

Of course, my greatest fantasy of all is my own private room with a bed that
doesn't have lumps and whose bedding isn't perpetually damp.  With my own
private bathroom with a tub to soak in when my legs are killing me and a
toilet I know nobody's thrown up on.  

How age changes us.  I used to scorn RV users because "they weren't really
camping".  Now one of my great ambitions in life is to become one.  

I  would welcome a permament, well provided for site.  I've been coming to
Pennsic ever since Pennsic VIII.  I've seen two bath houses built, new flush
toilets added, a second swimming hole made, water piped to the Tu Chucks camp,
a laundry built, camping space expanded, the store grown to provide all manner
of useful items and now occupying a tent as well as the building, ice carted
in, firewood cut, and so on.  I think the Cooper's are doing an excellent job
attending to our needs.

I think some other things could be done.  Expanding the water system,
definitely.  More faucets to more areas of the camp, more flush toilets, more
showers, an air conditioned site for the chirugeons, some place more suitable
for holding classes than the barn and bath house.  

And I think the idea of establishing a paid office for whoever autocrats the
war is an excellent idea too.  I sure wouldn't want to autocrat it.  And the
people who do so much for us are deserving of compensation. " All the fine words
and all the fine phrase never helped put food on the table," to paraphrase a
plaque hanging in my mother's kitchen.

	I'm trying to get a smoker built (that is, a box to smoke

period recipes for such items: jerkey, smoked fish, sausages (polish
sausage/summer sausage types), bacon, ham, etc).

	Does anyone know if cheeses were smoked in period, or is this
more recent, just done for flavor?

	Also, if anyone has suggestions for making the smoker,
references, etc., I would be interested in hearing from you.  My dad
has one, and I got info from him; he uses just a hot plate, with a pan
containing wood chips on it.  This seems pretty safe, as not much heat

Re:  Banishment, and restriction of attendance.

Basically, the SCA has no way to prevent attendance at events.
Other than the procedures any other group/individual has.  i.e. the
SCA, Inc., (or presumably a local group) could follow mundane legal
procedure, either by having the individual arrested (for a crime),
or by having a "restraining order" issued by a judge (if threat to
individuals could be shown).

The SCA, Inc (or presumably a local group) could limit the
activities of individuals (i.e. no fighting) or restrict the
membership.  But I see no way to limit access to "non-profit
educational activities open to the public".  (other than mundane
legal procedure)

Re:  Persona Banishment.

So what?  Basically, many people in the SCA don't have personas.  I
don't claim to have a persona, Count William the Lucky claims to
have no persona.  Many people I know don't have personas.

The people who have personas, and are willing to modify their
behavior because their "persona" was "banished" aren't usually the
problem.  They would probably modify their behavior anyway, if asked
under the right circumstances.  i.e. they're willing to play "the
game".

Re:  Copora suggested banishment.

Basically, this is suggesting we quantify what is probably the
maximum allowable (legally).  And limiting its use to specific
individuals (Kings/Princes).  i.e. we are limiting ourselves, both
to protect ourselves, legally, and to restrict our "game".

i.e. Should people other than the (King/Prince) be allowed to banish
someone?  Should a banishment effect all areas of the SCA?  or just
the local area?  Should a banished person be able to fight (at all),
or should their authorization be voided?  etc.

These seem to be the issues that need to be addressed, not "can we
keep people out we don't like", to which the answer is basically no.

I usually dump the leather onto foil or newspaper to cool.  I let is sit until
it comes down to a reasonable temperature and then fit it.  This takes a
little longer, but my freezer is full enough, and the excess wax has more
time to run off.

Be careful.  If the wax is too hot or has hot spots, you can toast the
leather and ruin the piece. While the above method works, it introduces
opportunities for uneven coverage, leaving soft spots in the armour.  For
large pices, I generaly buy a diposable (large) cookie sheet and I have an
old basting brush just for this work (I used to use a cheap paint brush, but
the glue kept melting :-).  Put your large piece on the cookie sheet in an
oven set to about the melting point of the wax (130 - 150 Deg. F) and let
it warm up.  Use the basting brush to baiste the leather with hot wax every
5 minutes until the piece will not absorb more wax. Check that the wax has
penetrated the piece.  If it has, take it out and let it cool, if not, wait
a bit longer and check again.

I don't know about *that*.  After hearing it for nearly 20 years,
I find I still react pretty strongly.

On the other hand--I agree: It isn't period, but to modern ears,
(mine, at least) it stll *sounds* period.  Part of the problem here
is: What is period?  As a 9th-century Dane living in Northumbria,
my idea of what a proper oath is will differ a lot from a 15th

Anyone can *accuse* of anything.  Fortunately--it don't think it can
be made to stick.  There have been times in the past--and you remember
those debates as well as I do--that a very good case could be made
for discrimiation, so don't be too sure that what is considered
innocent now will continue to be so.  A recent debate in this very
forum points up where some of *those* rocks lie.

In general, a very sound analysis.  Now all you have to do is get
the diplomats to pretty up the language.  (You know:  Diplomacy Dept.--
We do and say the nastiest things in the nicest way.)  Personnaly,
I think a lot of this amounts a tempest in a teapot.  While there 
need to be contingency rules in place--for the reasons I noted above--
I doubt that they will be invoked very often, and this is as it should
be.  Just remember--to go with your Latin--this is an organization that
votes with it's feet.

If *all* qualifications are met--why do they not receive the honors
they have earned?  As Mistress Hilary so wonderfully puts it:  We don't

it harms the Kingdom not to recognize that fact?

Interesting method.  Do all of your Peers, then, individually swear
fealty to a new King?  In the West, there is a set sequence, but
the various groups (Great Officers, Chivalry, Laurels, Pelicans),
do so collectively.  Possiblly this is a result of having more Peers.

In light of the individual oaths, does the King have a different oath
fo each of his Peers?  This would certainly be period, but it could
get a little difficult.

I would have to check, but there are similar general criteria here.  I
doubt (I'd have to look it up) that the time in residence is as long.

Not surprising.

Interesting.  I think it would be hard to get such agreement here.
It works as an effective safeguard against having a real new comer
win the lists.  Even Duke Paul of Bellatrix took the better part of
a year (he was actively training in various martial arts when he
joined the Society) to get good enough to win.

Very well put statement on periodness of names and why the requirements
should be relaxed somewhat.

However .. when you say that if XXndred (and the like) are proper names
and therefore XXn would also be a proper name ... well, you're ignoring
a linguistic fact.  That's an overly simple rule and won't always work.
For instance, just to be obtuse, "David" --> "Dav" doesn't work.  Tho,
"David" --> "Davi" does work after a fashion since I'm sometimes called 
"Davey" :-)

I have only taken a couple of linguistics courses so I am not able to
propose any better sort of rules.  I can only point it out as a problem.
I believe, but do not know for certain, that the underlying linguistic
rules will vary a fair bit from language to language.


The time difference between now & the time we're recreating causes us
all sorts of problems.  In this case we don't speak language as they
did and don't use names the way we do.  Therefore our gut reactions
and the like are "off the mark".  Probably the College has been too
strict in the past but it's better than being too loose.

P.S. My name would pass the College since I'm using my true name.  However
     I have no idea if "le casse'" would ever be used by someone in 
     period or not, or if my spelling of casse' is proper Middle French
     or not.  On the other hand it's a transliteration of a nickname

There have been kings of both the Middle and Meridies who were unbelted.
Ones I know of are Eliahu (the war king last summer) and Kane who wasn't
knighted until *AFTER* his *SECOND* reign ... he was knighted on the field
last summer at The Border Raids.

The only problem I know of is that the King has to have a Knight
help him in the Knighting ceremony.  A Knight must be holding or
helping to hold the sword.

In the Middle, the Oath of Fealty appears to change in small details
on occasion.  It is largely the same, but the wording or actions
change from reign to reign.

I don't know.  I do know that a certain recent King of the Middle did
cause a bit of an uproar and people talking about him.

All the belted fighters are automatically on the Crown List.  I have
heard but am not certain that if a belted fighter *ATTENDS* the crown
tourney s/he *MUST* fight in the tournament ... Except if s/he is
a Duke in which case they are deemed to have "paid their dues" and
can decline to participate.

Other fighters can be added to the list at the indulgence of the
Crown Prince.

We have previously required at least 3 months of membership prior
to participating in the Crown Tourney.  However in the most recent
Pale we've been informed this rule has been changed to simply require
proof of membership at the time of the Tourney.

I don't know about weapons in the Middle but have heard an interesting
thing about Meridies.  There the Crown Prince selects a weapon type
to be used in the Tourney.  And apparently whenever someone wants
John the Beer(er..Bear)killer they pick pole arms as the weapon...



It's amazing what you know about your neighbors when you live on
the border of a kingdom ...

Papworth's Ordinary of British Armorials is in print and available

Papworth costs about $120 at current exchange rates, including postage

Good point!  Master Yosef Alaric's favorite documented period oath of

Ah, but the qualifications of a King are not the same as the
qualifications of a Knight.  A King must be a wise and careful ruler,
slow to anger and quick to forgive, deliberate in his thoughts, and
resolute in his decisions.  In practice, he just has to have one good
day on the field.  A Knight must be the model of chivalry and honor at
all times, first in battle and last in retreat, unswerving in his
loyalty to the Crown.  It is often the case that these qualifications
occur in the same man, but not always.

Yes & yes.  In First Court, each peerage order is called into court
and the companions are given the opportunity to swear fealty
individually.  The Crown responds to each peer individually.  It takes
a while, but I think it creates a much stronger bond between the
individual peer and the Crown than would a group oath.  Great Officers
and Landed Baroncy also swear oaths in the same manner, and have also
joined the escalation in oaths.  Two reigns ago, Baron Settmour was
carried into court on a palanquin with armed guards, dancing girls,
and trumpets, flinging gold into the crowd.  Quite a performance.

  It might be worth noting that Eatern officers do not swear fealty,
but rather swear an oath of office.  The distinction may be a fine
one, but it is important.  My own oath, for example, tends to run
something like:

I am Arval Benicoeur, Brigantia Principal Herald.  I am Your voice and
Your ears, your messenger and ambassador.  I swear to fulfill the
duties of my office to the best of my ability, and to obey Your every
lawful command, saving only my duties to the Laurel Queen of Arms.  I
offer you my counsel and my aid in all Your endeavors.  All this do I
swear for as long as I serve the Crown of the East and You sit on Your
thrones, and should I fail in this oath, may my tongue rot in my
mouth.

...give or take a bit.

	Arval.

About finding period books:  I highly recommend using Books in Print.  Several
of the books mentioned are definitely in print, and may be ordered from the
publisher.  I have seen a recent paperback edition of A.C.'s 'Courtly Love'.

Penguin books has an excellent verse translation of the 'Orlando Furioso' in 2
volumes, in print as of a few years ago at least.  If anyone knows a source
for 'Orlando Innamorato' (to which the Furioso is a sequel), please mail me
info.

Speaking of the Furioso, Cariadoc mentioned an interesting anecdote about its
first English translation, in Elizabeth's court.  I would be greatly

Subject: inter-kingdom anthropology and others
Message-Id: <3141@tank.uchicago.edu>

I am writing in response to Hal Ravn very interesting queries about
inter-kingdom differences. 

Ceremonies: Parts of the original Middle Kingdom coronation oath (and
allegiance oaths) were also, and independently, lifted from Tolkien.  The
ceremony also included the "this is what it means to be a king" passage
from C.S. Lewis, "The Horse and His Boy." When I came back to the Kingdom
some fifteen years later and attended a coronation, what struck me most
was the process of accretion. Much of the original ceremony still
remained, but it looked as though every second or third king had decided
to add just one more bit, to "improve" it. The result was poetically and
dramatically much weaker than the original (you may want to allow for my
bias on the question). Recently Eliahu, with whom I had discussed the
matter, did a rewrite that seemed to substantially improve the situation. 

Unbelted Kings: The situation as I remember it in the East was that there
was a time when no unbelted fighter had ever been crowned--either the
winner was a knight, or he was knighted after winning. A number of us felt
that that was an undesirable situation, since it seemed to imply that
prowesse alone was a sufficient qualification for knighthood. At the same
time, it was hard to break the tradition, since failing to knight the
victor would seem to imply that he was particularly unqualified. The
problem was finally solved when someone won the crown who was unbelted and
thought the tradition was a bad one; he requested the king not to knight
him. All of this is by memory, and some of what I am describing may be
what I thought other people thought was happening, so to speak, but I
think it is essentially correct.

Another posting (by Arval) said that the East had had two unbelted kings,
Viktor and Morgan. Memories are short. I believe Fernando was the first
unbelted King of the East and Gyrth the second; Gyrth got knighted during
his reign by the King of Meridies at Pennsic, with (I am told) the
unanimous assent of the Eastern Chivalry.

The same posting asserted that the ratio of knights to population is lower
in the East than in other Kingdoms. I would be interested to see numbers.
I have occasionally tried to do such estimates, for particular kingdoms,
and do not have the impression that the East is strikingly different from
Meridies or the Middle. I have heard that Atenvelt has more knights and a
different definition of what a knight means than other kingdoms, but do
not know if it is true.

The posting also asserted, about the residency requirement, that "We
established this requirement because we believe that the East is a very
different land from the other 11 Kingdoms.  Much of what is important
about the East is not written down anywhere, but only exists as custom.  A
King unfamiliar with Eastern custom could not rule well." True and false.
Arval seems to imply that the other kingdoms were similar to each other
and the East somehow special. That was not true when the residency
requirement was established, and is not true now. The reason for the
requirement was that kingdoms are different from each other, not that the
East was more different than other kingdoms.  

Hal Ravn also seems to take it for granted that the West has more peers
than the East. I would be interested to see the numbers. The East has a
substantially larger population, and although it is younger, a difference
of two years or so is not all that large from a distance of over twenty.

Entering the Crown: In the Middle at present, all belted fighters are
allowed in the crown unless specifically forbidden by the King. Unbelted
fighters are permitted by invitation, with many but far from all being
invited. As far as I know this is the only kingdom that does it that way.
In the very early years, the rule was all belted fighters plus anyone who
had won one major or two minor tournaments since the last crown (I think;
details may be wrong, given that I am remembering events from almost
twenty years ago). In effect, we were using other tournaments as
preliminary elimination rounds to keep down the size of the crown lists.
At some point that shifted to the present system, where the king in effect
decides who would make a tolerable successor. On the whole, I think it is
a bad idea, for reasons that would take a while to go into. On the other
hand, it seems to have worked all right, and I like the idea of different
kingdoms having their own traditions.

Some more queries: How do the relations between peer and
squire/apprentice/protegee vary among the kingdoms? My impression of one
kingdom where I have lived was that an apprentice was not so much someone
the Laurel was teaching a craft to as someone the Laurel was sponsoring to
become a Laurel--thus it was considered perfectly normal for a Laurel to
take an apprentice who practiced an art the Laurel had no expertise in.
Someone else, commenting on a different part of the same kingdom,
expressed the opinion that apprentices and protegees were, in effect,
trading labor (doing the less pleasant parts of what had to be done in a
household) for political support. That is certainly not how I perceive the
relation, but I do not know how things vary through different kingdoms. A
couple of objective questions that might shed light on such issues are: 1:
Do Laurels take apprentices not their own field? 2: How common is it for
someone to become a peer without first being a squire/apprentice/protegee?

it.

finalist (I do not recall who it was) was also unbelted. There was some
feeling that a) the King should be a knight and b) both fighters were
worthy candidates, and it was unfair to give one a knighthood simply because
he had won a single battle, so the tourney was temporarily suspended while
both were knighted, and then continued.

<This posting was once munched by the line eater. I have witnesses.>
In the middle kingdom, Duke Sir Laurelen Darksbane was knighted on
the field *during* Crown Tourney. Neither finalist was belted, and the
feeling of the King was that it would be unfair to two honourable and
valiant men to knight only one, based on the results of a single fight.
Therefore, just before the final round, Crown Tourney was suspended,
both contestants were knighted, and the tourney was completed. (I
believe Laurelen eventually won.)

My lord.  In the first place, thanks for the small mead recipe.
It has aged beautifully in the last two weeks and tastes great.
Q: Do you ever use spices other than ginger.

But to the main point.  The most typicall problem I have seen
(in my very short experience) that most conflicts are between
people at their first event and 'old timers' who think the newcommers
know better.  It is very important to deal politely with newbies,
else they get turned off. (Such a case transpired with my brother.)

You do occassionaly run into people who *do* know better, but
for some reason or other bring an anachronism in.  At my first
event, some folks brought plastic plates and silver.  My response:
"My, what exotic enamel you bring." It is not generaly necessary
to bitch and moan at people unless they go out of their way to be
obmoxious.

        Good Mistress Niccola, (Milord Orlando please forward), Quite some time
ago you posted a horribly obnoxious, boastful message about your upcoming
victory at the Ice Dragon Pent.  I immediately wrote a response.  I deleted it.
I wrote another one a few weeks ago and deleted that too.  I have considered
long, and Now I finally feel ready to respond.  In that time I realized what
was going on.  (Please correct me if I'm wrong) As a Laurel you do not really
need to win for your own pride, and you certainly can't feel that you need to
embarrass and shame everyone else in the process by boasting and carping.  So,
why do you post such things?  Clearly you feel it is your responsibility as a
Laurel to encourage arts and good research, and you feel that this is a fun and
effective way to get lots of people inspired to work against you, thus raising
the level of work in the kingdom.  Bravo.  And certainly your posting hints are
good advice - especially your first one about documentation and your most
recent one about being wary of drawings.  Certainly that is why my lady spent
most of our recent vacation in England running from the Nat'l portrait gallery
to the V&A and so forth collecting hundreds of postcards and slides (not to
mention photographs of stuff in special collections that she needed
appointments to see) both for herself (Elaine Courtenay) and for Elaigne Kerr.
And speaking of Elaigne, I find it amusing that you seem so confidant of
winning the knitting because I know the best knitter in the Kingdom - the one
who made my hat (the documentation for which won this year's paper category).
And you should see her next project!

	Well... that isn't even true today, in all cultures.  Japan still
has a list of approved names... though it was ignored in the past and may
still be today.  A Korean friend's middle name was Korean for "oak",
and for a very good reason: his mother had several children that died
in infancy, and so she decided to give Chun Ro a good strong name...
and he lived.  So all his brothers and sisters have the same middle
name: Oak.  But I've never encountered a culture, other than our own, 
where names that were simply madeup were accepted, they always came
from somewhere, be it another person or a thing.  And most of those
names that are madeup are compounds of the like of Crazy Horse or
even Skallagrim ("Bald Grim") or even Kollskegg ("Black Beard").

	I was going to save this for another posting, but what the
hell.  My name, Kwellend-Njal, was made up.  With a twist: I went
back to Proto IndoEuropean roots for the elements.  My persona is
headed back to Iceland to see how my father's family is doing...
I'm completing the journey he started out on years ago.  kwellend,
as originally concieved, is from hwella, "wheel" and -land "land"
(surprised? :-).  I palitalized the h to a k, giving me basically
kwellaland, and then, in process as old as English itself, dropped
the repeated sylable, yeilding kwelland, meaning a circle of land,
or in my case, completing a journey.  (England comes from Anglaland,
and the two -la-'s in it were dropped by the same process.)

	Then I found out (after using it for about 4 years) that I
had to document the name...  uhoh.  What saved me was that I had
used (more or less by accident) good linguistic methods in generating
it, so it was easy to find an almost identical word, cwellend.  The
c -> k shift was simply orthographic and the a->e was trivial, 
since neither is stressed it sounds about the same in modern 
speach.  And, luckily (and it is luck that lets one slide by with some
thing like this) the word was an adjective, and perfectly period
one 'killer' (not one I would have chosen personally, but it makes
a suitably ironic nickname given my personality.)  After that came
the hard part...  :-)  but that's for another time. 


>Wanting to be considered a subject of a Kingdom other than that in which one
>resides, and the effects of same.

	Hmmmm.... ( I let the original expire without getting my comments
in, so I'll answer this one here.)  I'm of two minds here.  I started in
Ansteorra, and still have friends there.  I still get Blackstar in fact.
I also lived several years in the Midrealm and have lots of friends there...
as well as having friends in other Kingdoms due to relocation and such.
Indeed, if any of a handfull of people, regardless of where they lived or
where I lived, were to win Crown and come to Pennsic, I would offer them
my sword in the Battles, because to my Persona (as well as to myself)
this means more than loyalty to the Kingdom I'm living in.  In fact, given
this fact, I would not be able to accept a knight's belt and chain...
as the most I feel free to exchange with My King and Queen is an oath
of service (as with Eislynn) or an oath of friendship.

	On the other hand...  In the current middle ages as well as
in the ones we recreate, if you lived in a kings domain you were 
subject to his law.  I don't see how someone living in one kingdom
can hold an office in another, something that a change in the rules
of this nature would allow...  and something that is sometimes 
easy to forget is that this is game we play...  in the long run
does it matter that if my job relocated me to another area that suddenly
I am a subject of that kingdom?  I have my roots in the other, but I
can hopefully enrich both by the change.  (Am I making any sense?)

Enough!! I've gone on too long as it is.  Let's see what others have
to add.

===the following is a note from a fellow staffer here at Notre Dame=====

Gentles of the net,
Another comment on banishment, for what it's worth.
I feel that being in the SCA is a priviledge, not a right.  If
someone acts in a way that is serious enough for a royal to
banish them, they should have known better.  And certainly, in
some cases I hope the banishment is forever - not just for one
reign.  Let me give an example or two.
It's very easy to steal from people who are camping, especially
at a crowded place like Pennsic.  Thievery just shouldn't be
tolerated.
There's mashers and there's mashers.  Any of us who read the
mundane news know how ineffective the law is in dealing with
these lowlifes.  Serious problems (like rape or attempted rape)
should not be dealt with lightly.  After all, we don't have
period means of punishing people (death, maiming, need
I go on?)
Lastly, no fun to mention this, but there are lots of
children of all ages at Pennsic, and unfortunately child
abusers are a reality.  I don't know of any cases of this
(but I'm new) but don't you think someone who threatened
a child or abused a child deserves the worst we can deal
them? (not to mention pursuit of mundane law).  I'm all
for chivalry, and personal solutions to minor problems, but
I think we have to face the fact that there may be cases
where the strictest punishment is appropriate.

(aka Cathy Lindsay of Notre Dame)
Lorico, I hope that's not too long.  But I think it's a
serious issue and I think some people would like to pretend
that the world is as pretty as a medieval tapestry.  Sigh.
Thanks.


In response to Chelidon o Gaerddrych about camping
arrangements at Pennsic:
I find it nigh unto unbelieveable that you think a five
dollar fee (or tax or whatever) is discriminatory but hold
that those who can spend the summer at Coopers Lake deserve
preferential treatment!  For those whose mundane jobs don't
allow that kind of time off (or whose lives don't allow a
large time spent without pay) your proposed system is *much*
more discriminatory!  Requiring gentles to cough up $5 is
much more fair to everyone than giving preferential treatment
to those who for whatever reason (either because they're
students or teachers or anyone else who can camp out for long
periods) have the luxury of being there first.
I for one wouldn't mind a tax if it goes towards more showers!
Two Pennsics have shown me that the facilities there are very
inadequate in this respect.  (We can't escape our twentieth
century noses and standards for personal cleanliness, after
all.)

I certainly can't speak authoritatively about the differences among
Kingdoms, nevers having lived outside the East, but the feeling that
custom is more important in the East than elsewhere seems widespread,
and also seems to be borne out in a comparison of Kingdom law.  Most
Kingdoms put into law many of the things which are accepted as ancient
custom in the East.  This was the difference I was trying to point
out.

Now that's a fascinating question!  I really haven't done any hard
research.  It is certainly true that a comparison of month-to-month

and common opinion agrees.  However, I think some research is in

Subject: arts and science competitions
Message-ID:  <8905092001.aa02893@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>


Fro a number of years I took it as my special duty to feed and clothes newbies
in our area.  As I helped them learn about the SCA, eventually we discussed
arts and science competitions.  Few of them were thrilled by the concept.  Two
attitudes prevailed 1) I do it because I like it and letting other people
nit-pick my work isn't fun.  2) I'm new to the group and just started doing
this stuff so I could never win so I won't enter.  I tried to encourage people
to enter, but not being too enthusiastic about the system myself, I'm afraid my
persuasions lacked conviction.  Now my Shire is threatening to make me Minister
of Arts and Sciences and I've been thinking about this issue, and I have a
suggestion to offer.

Adopt the state fair system.  At fairs, all entrants are judged and awarded
either a blue, red, or yellow ribbon.  ALL entrants receive ribbons, except for
pieces that are utterly pathetic, which rarely ocurrs.  One piece in each
category is picked for a "first place" or "best of category".  One piec is
picked for "best of show".  Thus everybody gets feed back and appreciation for
their efforts. People with less skill can still win, because they get ribbons.
People with high degree of skill can be honored with best of category and best
of show awards. Sometimes special awards are sponsored by businesses and 
awarded on diferent criteria than the fair awards.  This means everybody has
lots of chances to earn distinction for themselves and be encouraged to
continue, rather than be disappointed and discouraged because their piece was
good enough.

I've noticed that arts and science competitions are generally pretty thin with
entries.  I would enter a lot more often if I felt I was getting positive feedback
instead of being nit-picked.  I bet a lot of other people would too.  By
adopting this system it would also be easier to reccommend people for arts and
science awards.  Instead of writing a letter of reccomendation that says
"George has made all these really neat things this year, and one of them won
once, but I think he should have won more"  could be replaced with more
objective criteria "George has entered four different pieces of armour in
competitions in the last year and has received three blue ribbons and a red
ribbon.One of his pieces took best of category."

This system would also make it easier for people to know and recognize the
achievements of other people, even in fields they didn't know much about.  When
I go up to embroidery, I can tell what's good, because I know embroidery.  But
when I look at leatherworking or calligraphy, I know almost beans about them.
All I can say is: "I think it's pretty."  But I don't know if the person has done
something difficult or easy, or even if it's period or not.  If I see a piece
with a blue ribbon on it I learn something.  "Aha, bright red is period after
all! Otherwise it wouldn't have gotten a blue ribbon."

I think we might see people entering more obscure items if they didn't have to
try and shoehorn them into some other category so that there'd be enough pieces
to judge among. I remember when a fellow painstakingly recreated lampblack ink
and did a small piece of calligraphy with it.  He had a two page article
documenting his sources and methods.  There were no other inks, dyes, pigments,
or any kind of colorants entered, so they put him in the calligraphy category,
even though it was the ink, not the writing he was entering.  Argh!  He didn't
win, but personaly I feel he should have been recognized.  But he didn't fit
the standard categories.   Everyone agreed he did a wonderful thing, and
calligraphers were hunting him down and asking for his ink, but no  award.

Assuming I do win the election to the post of minister of arts and sciences, I
am going to try and implement this system for competition.  Hopefully it will
spark people do more along these lines.  Our shire seems more interested in
hosting events and fighting than arts and sciences. As far as I can tell so
far, very little a & s is being done here.  (Except cooking.  We have a strong
and skilled cook's guild.One of our cooks has the great distinction of the
massed populace crying "We want more turnips!" "But nobody likes turnips," he
replied in bewilderment.  He has promised turnips for our next feast, lots of
'em.)

on face, no visor, spun-bowl top) is ~$60.  Add a visor, and you're talking on
the order of $80-85.  Things can go up drastically from there, depending on
what you want: kabuda, 'lobster-tail', mesh face, pig-face bassinets (sp?),
etc.
   Used helms are another matter.  I recently sold my old one (standby style)
for $35, having purchased it several years ago for $40.  I replaced it with a
better-fitting helm, about the same style, that cost me a case of Fosters Lager
(17.95) at last years Pennsic.  (The previous owner had just purchased a new
helm, and was _real_ thirsty...)  I reccomend looking around for a used helm
as a starter if at all possible.  Just be certain to repad it for _your_ head,
not theirs.

Subject: Is the Pennsic War Too Large?
Message-Id: <3149@tank.uchicago.edu>

First, I apologize for this being an ephemeral posting: David Friedman is
guesting me and I have no permanent access to the net. I am not likely to
answer any queries this posting might create, but hope the topic is of
general interest to some.

In a recent posting, someone made the claim that the Pennsic War was
getting too large.  I don't think this is true. It seems to me there are
three possible meanings for the statement.

1) The battles are becoming too large to conduct. From the fighter's
standpoint, I think this is patently false. The neat thing about Pennsic
battles are that they can be conducted at a size normally impossible to
us.  From a safety standpoint, a larger battle is riskier in the sense
that the likelihood of someone getting killed is larger with 2000
participants than with 500. It is also riskier in the sense that medical
response time for any battle is longer, since it takes a notable time to
stop a battle and get the appropriate personnel to the injured fighter /
waterbearer / spectator. From the first cause,  an individual's risk is no
higher personally; from the second,  the field/bridge battle becomes
riskier to fight in, but less risky than the woods battle, since the
terrain is gentler, and medical response time is still higher than for
someone in the woods.

2) The site is too small. It might be the case that there isn't enough
room to camp, isn't enough water to shower with, the woods are too small
to do battle in, etc.  I think the physical facilities are adequate -- the
Coopers keep expanding the available land, and they keep building more
facilities. It is the case that the Far Hill is a terrible place to be
camped for a lot of people: you essentially leave your campsite in the
morning, and come back in the evening.  I think there are things that can
be done about this problem:  with a new woods area to fight in,  more of
where we fought the old wolds battle can be used for camping; the hillside
could be landscaped so camping could occur closer to the main event area; 
a place for storing equipment (with a checkin/checkout facility) could be
set up in the main area; a discounted fee could be offered to people
willing to camp on the hill.

3) Nobody wants to autocrat an event with 10,000 people at it. I know I
sure don't. I think if Pennsic does become that size, we should pay some
of our people to do the work required. We do it for other parts of the
Socity, and here we have the advantage of being able to pay for help out
of the event charge.

Subject: Rolls Ethereal part 1 of 3

			The Rolls Ethereal
			------------------
 
At long last, here is the new edition of the Rolls Ethereal! The Rolls
are intended to be a sort of "phone book" for SCAdians on the Net, at least
those who are interested in being in it. Anyone who considers themselves
SCAdian, and who has some sort of Use/ARPA/Inter/BIT/etcNet access is
welcome to send in an entry for inclusion.
 
The SCAnet
----------
 
Just in case a copy of this falls into the hands of someone who doesn't
already know about it, the SCAnet, as I refer to it here, is the amalgam
of a Usenet newsgroup and an Internet mailing list. Those on Usenet who
are interested can subscribe to the newsgroup "alt.sca"; those on Internet
should write to: sca-request@mc.lcs.mit.edu to request a subscription.
Note that these are redundant; things posted to the one should make their
way onto the other pretty quickly.
 
How to get into these Rolls
---------------------------
 
Those who want to be listed should send the following information to the
Editor of the Rolls (currently Justin du Coeur, justin@inmet.inmet.com):
 
1) SCA Name
2) Mundane Name
3) SCA location (eg, Kingdom & Barony/Shire)
4) Mundane location (eg, city and state)
5) Titles & offices, if any
6) Interests
7) Net address
 
Some comments on the fields:
 
-- The only information that *must* be sent for inclusion is an SCA or
   Mundane name, and Net address. All other fields are optional (most
   people supply them, but for the privacy concious...) If you don't
   have an SCA name yet, but consider yourself a SCAdian, that's fine;
   just say so, and send an update as soon as you come up with an
   SCA name; in the meantime, you'll be listed under the Mundane name.
 
-- Please keep the data short. There is only one line available for Titles
   & Offices. If you have been in the Society for twenty years, and have
   accumulated dozens of titles, you can probably consider yourself an
   honored member of the Order of the Etc. Titles or Offices that you are
   particularly proud of should be listed *first*; if I have to trim the
   line, I give preference to things in the front. Likewise, there is
   only one line for Interests. If you are a Jack of All Trades, just say
   so. Particular interests should be listed first.
 
-- Don't make too many assumptions about my knowledge. Even if everyone
   in the Kingdom of New Oz knows and respects the Order of the Hippo as
   the highest award around, it's quite possible that I've never heard of
   it, so *don't* abbreviate it to "OHip" without explaining what that
   means.
 
-- Mundane location does not mean full street address. It is simply
   intended as a general locator, so that people can figure out literally
   where you're coming from. It isn't very obvious on the Net, and not
   everyone is proficient in converting SCA geography to Mundane.
 
-- For the Net address, Inter/ARPANet format (mumble@foobar.site.domain)
   is *strongly* preferred; this is fast becoming a world-wide standard,
   and is a lot more compact than giving the entire linkage tree from the
   backbone. If you *must* give a bang-address (...x!y!foobar!mumble),
   choose *one* best path, and list that. Again, I'm trying to keep this
   down to one line (thus saving me some typing). Also, remember to
   specify which Net you're on; "mumble@foobar" could be Usenet, BITNET,
   or an abbreviated Internet address.
 
Format of the List
------------------
 
After giving some thought to the matter, I concluded that there is really
*no* common standard formatter for the Net. Therefore this file is flat
ASCII. The only liberty that I have taken is form-feeds (^L) between
sections. You may format it to your heart's desire (for Unix users, the
simplest thing to do is just say, "pr ethrolls | lpr" (assuming you've
saved this post to the file "ethrolls"); this will give you a perfectly
readable, if not fancy, output). If you decide to port this to some 
fancy formatter like troff or Postscript, I suggest making it available
to the public by announcing to the SCAnet that you're willing to mail
it to people. DO NOT re-post the newly-formatted version to the list;
having a dozen versions of the Rolls posted in two weeks would be a
*very* good way to get us in dutch with the administrators of Usenet,
as well as those at mc.lcs.mit.edu.
 
The format of a typical entry (I use myself as an example), is:
 
Justin du Coeur ( Mark Waks )
  Barony of Carolingia, East ( Boston, MA )
  Baronial Dancemaster, Keeper of these Rolls
  Dance, archery, dance, autocratting, dance
  justin@inmet.inmet.com
 
The first line is my names, with the Mundane in parentheses. The second is
location, also with the Mundane in parens. Third is Titles and Offices,
fourth is Interests, and Fifth is Net address. Entries are in alphabetical
order by *SCA* name; those with no SCA name are in order by Mundane name
at the beginning. If I do not have Location, Titles, or Interests, those lines
will be left out, so don't be surprised if many entries have only three
or four lines. If I got my formatting software right, everything should
fit neatly into eighty columns; no margins are allowed for.
 
Multiple Entries
----------------
 
I have received a number of "care of" entries for the Rolls, where someone
not on the Net is receiving e-mail via someone who is. At the moment, I
am still accepting these, but I ask that this not be abused. *Don't*
send your entire group's names for entry under your address. It's fine
(for now, at least) to send your spouse's or Seneschal's entry c/o you,
but try to keep it down. The Rolls are getting quite large, and if this
gets abused too much, I'll have to cut out c/o entries entirely.
 
Likewise, I have received several "lists" of people on the Net, where one
member of a group sends information for everyone remotely connected to
the group. I believe that a lot of the members so listed are rather
peripheral, in the SCA or the Net or both. Therefore, I ask that people
send their own entries to me. It's fine to send information for a close
friend while you're doing your own, but any message containing more than
three entries risks being thrown out entirely. I'm sorry I have to do this,
but the only way that I can tell that someone actually cares about having
an entry is having them send it themselves, and it's no fun at all entering
the data for twenty people, suspecting that most of them aren't even active
SCAdians...
 
Accuracy
--------
 
There are no warrantees, express or implied, on this information. I'm 
printing it as I got it, this edition, and have made no attempts to
confirm that the Net addresses are currently valid. If your information
is incorrect, or you know *for sure* that someone else's is, send a
correction to me (justin@inmet.inmet.com).
 
Copyright
---------
 
Since a lot of people on Usenet are getting very picky about this nowadays,
let's make it explicit:
 
The Rolls Ethereal are Public Domain. You may print it, cut it up, remail
it, or what have you, freely and with no obligations.

Abbreviations
-------------
 
In most cases, I have spelled out awards and titles fully. However, there
are some titles that are either a) so common, or b) so long, that I felt
it best to abbreviate them. I have probably not been consistent in when
I abbreviate and when I spell out; forgive me if this troubles you at all.
One or two group names are also abbreviated, for the same reasons as awards.
The following are (I think) all of the abbreviations used in this book
(Except for the few where someone did send me something indecipherable,
like "OHip"). I have provided brief explainations, where I know them.
Anyone with a more authoritative knowledge of what awards are for, please
pass it on to me...

Last summer at Pennsic when we tried to get together ...

My impression was that quite a few people felt it wasn't "proper" to
mix computer talk in to Pennsic.  And truly, it's not proper to
actually mix the two.  At least not to any great extent.

Some of us did manage a small get-together, I forget when.  Actually
there was going to be two, but a high-level summit 'tween myself
and AMQ <@ rutgers> got 'em together and at the Settmour Swamp encampment.
They had a nice campfire and all.

I could see having a get-together this time around.  That would be
alright .. just so long as conversation doesn't concentrate on computing ;-).

I think that some of us will be part of some larger encampment which
wouldn't mind hosting such a party.  Of the ones I visited last summer,
both Carrilion and Settmour Swamp had reasonable encampments ... nice ones
in fact even if Settmour's was kinda crowded.

Message-Id: <11553@well.UUCP>


Greetings from Hal Ravn:

There was a recent posting wanting prices on helms.  As I was at
the same place as armorer Duke James Greyhelm last night, I inquired.

He makes helms for prices starting at about $140.  How much higher the
price goes depends on how fancy you want your helm to be.  (He mentioned
prices topping $1000, but that seemed to be the exception.)

To use a variant on an *old* blurb one saw in ads--prices are slightly 
higher East of the Rockies.

I went to the library on my lunch break (*), looked up a few of my
favorite books and chose the most beautiful first names

COMMENTS:

The dates listed are the earliest firm date I found for the name.
Many of them were in use before the dates given; many did not
become popular until after the date shown.

Accept my apologies if some of the languages are missing, 
or if I made some typoes or other errors; I was in a hurry.  
The point is that there are many beautiful names out there.  
Accents have been left out due to typographical constraints.

This is NOT a definitive list :-) nor can I guarantee that all these 
names would pass with any old surname/locative/patronymic (especially
some of the Gaelic names which are names of royalty).  
Also, remember that many languages are often pronounced in ways that 
(to Modern English-speakers) are unexpected.  
For instance, if I recall, Ablach is pronounced like AHV-lahkh, 
where `kh' represents a fricative sound not found in English.

Subject: Re: keeping debates to a minumum
Message-Id: <11657@s.ms.uky.edu>


It seems this group is giving me a nit to pick.  Ever since I've been involved
in sca I've found the group that does things and gets involved and then I've
found the group that likes to debate the minorest points along a campfire.

Although there are lots of people here that feel the need to be heard and have
wise amounts of information to pass across I do see the same problem here
about long discussions of unimportant points that really should be decided
by each individual for themselves.

I admit as a beginning poster here, I did get involved in wordy needless debates
and have seen a little bit smaller size in posting but I don't have time to 
read screenfuls and screenfuls of hwat religion is proper and which ones would
be appropriate.  I think that's up to the opinions of the individual.  

I would rather see screenfuls of information on how to help beginning fighters
since there are so many worldwide.

Could you please try to keep these debates to a minimum and rethink about 
whether personal mail may be a better way method of communication?  I just
don't have the time and feel I am missing something in worthwhile conversa-
tions.  If you could think about it, I would greatly appreciate efforts at
keeping postings down to a screen size or thereabouts.

Then again I may be making a request from a minority and debates do seem a 
little calmer these days.

This is the longest posting you'll see from me... 


Yours with TIME now for service (oh wow!)

Subject: Corpora comments on banishment
Message-ID:  <8905071234.aa11390@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

The idea of banishment is basically a way to legislate who will be allowed in
the SCA and who will not.  This bothers me.  I can see people being banished
simply because they're not popular with the local powers that be.  I am willing
to accept banishment of SCA personas for SCA reasons. For example, an officer
failing to carry out his office could be banished until such time as he had
caught up on his duties.  Banishment in such a case would basically be a
warning "Get it right, or you'll lose your office."

Banishing people, well, I don't go for that.  Yes, I've met men who couldn't
understand the word "no" too.  I think that such matters ought to handled on a
personal level.  A scenario could be,  Masher offends Lady.  Lady goes to her
champion and tells him about it.  Champion challenges Masher.  Masher doesn't
fight, so he has to get a Champion.  Everybody knows the Masher, nobody will
champion him.  Baron decides that everybody has a right to champion, so he
volunteers.  He decides also that justice must be served, so he fights with a
dagger and no shield and loses.  Masher has to apologize to Lady and promise to
stay away from her.  This is the period way to handle such affairs, and its
what chivalry is all about.  It also sends a very clear message to the offender
that his behaviour has made him unpopular and he'd better shape up, or leave.
It also means that anybody who wasn't aware of the Masher's behaviour is going
to hear about it.  Details need not be given:  Offense to a Lady is explanation
enough.

But people in the SCA are polite and tolerant.  They don't beat the daylights
out of somebody just because he's attempted to rape a woman.  So banishing him
is a nice neat way for them to avoid coping with the issue while getting him
out of their hair.  Some mashers are incurable.   Some mashers learn.  Remember
Gawain?  Gawain had a thing for the ladies.  Poetic justice was served out on
him by making him the defender of women.  Whenever a woman needed help in any
situation, Gawain was her champion.  Being forced to take the ladies' side
repeatedly eventually taught him to sympathize with them-and he became a gentle
knight.  He was still fond of the ladies, but he a was sensitive about it.

And then there is the situation:Banishment as a punishment for what mundane law
could prosecute.  In these situations, let the mundane law prosecute.  Passing
judgement on others is not a function of the SCA.  It is quite conceivable that
a person banished for a theft that wasn't mundanely prosecuted could sue the
SCA for denying him his rights without due process of law.  If we're going to
banish people we need to set up some kind of judicial proceeding to fairly
examine all points of view and determine whether banishment (or any other kind
of punishment ) is appropriate.  This is not medeival, the whims of kings were
law in period. But we live in the modern world, and modern American law says
you can't deprive a person of anything without proper proceedings.  That's a
can of worms I don't want to open.  SCA judges?  Yuck.  I'd rather keep things
personal.  The custom of duelling does have it's advantages, even if we modern
folk are so civilized we're shocked by the concept of using violence to solve
problems. 

Of course, what I expect to happen is what has been happening: SCA folk will
ignore unpleasant people to the best of their ability and eventually they go
away.  This seems to be  a reasonably workable system and I don't think the 
Corpora needs to concern itself with matters like these.  The Corpora ought to
confine itself strictly to those matters necessary for the SCA to function.

Subject: Corpora comments
Message-ID:  <8905071234.aa11393@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

The subject of names is a tricky one.  Various gentles have spoken in favor of
requiring documented names only.  they consider the phrase "period ambience" an
invitation to abuse.  We do need a standard, and at first glance I think
documented only is a good idea, but then I remember problems people have had.
Let me give an example, using a completely fictious name so that I won't be
intruding on anybody's privacy.
	
A friend of mine tried to register the name XXn.  The heralds refused.  Xxn was
only used as a part of names,  and his name would have to be the long form of
some other name, such as Xxnbio, or Xxnal, or Xxndred.  They wouldn't let him
use plain old Xxn, because it wasn't documented.  He tacked on a knickname, and
became Xxn of Vv, but they still didn't go for it.  "Xxn" is never used alone
they proclaimed.  Then, one day, quite by accident, he came across reference to
an obscure Celtic king named Xxn.  Therefore he was able to document it as a
period name, and they had to pass it.

I think that if Xxn is used in compound names there is no reason why it
shouldn't be used singly.  I'm sure Xxndred's friends called him just Xxn, so
why not let somebody else have it as is?  There are lots of other names that
can't be documented, that is to say, you can't point at an existing historical
person with the same name, but nonetheless would be recognized as a
comprehensible name by the poeple from its period.  So I think names that are
plausible variations or dirivatives of known period names ought to be
accepted.

And if we're going to insist on period names used in period ways, well, that
can be abused too.  For example, twenty-five per cent of the men in Normandy
during William the Bastard's day were named William.  Are we going to require
one fourth of Norman personas to be named William?

And what is acceptable documentation?  I picked my name from legend and it
passed.  Names that ocurr in legends in period could have been used by ordinary
people, and often were.  I have met a modern mundane woman with my SCA name,
showing that the boundary between legend and reality is thin.  And what will
we do about "legends" that might be history?  Is it acceptable to use an name
that is completely fictional, but was used in period?  Medeival writers often
invented names.  Can I use one of them?

An example: Hamlet.  Shakespeare
used the name, but it was not a name in currency any place in Europe.  It was a
derivative of an older Danish name, Amleth.  Shakespeare's play is a reworking
of an old Danish legend.  Can Hamlet and Amleth be used?  They were used in
period, at least in fictional pieces.  Or are they forbidden, because they are
fictional?  Or if I want to use the name Amleth do I have to prove the
historical validity of the legend?

I am willing to accept names that can be shown to have some kind of historicity
as their basis.  Something that came out of the blue with no connection to
anything is out.  I am also willing to allow the use of names from fiction
provided that the name is used in a period manner and has a period basis.
Maybe meeting somebody named Gandalf would make you think of Tolkien's work,
but I have met a mundane person with t he surname of Gandalf.  At first i was
startled, but then I recalled that all of Tolkien's names have historical
basis, so I got used to it.

  If somebody wants to use a name that's already been used and made famous 
by someone else,all they have to do is tack something onto 
it that makes it possible to distinguish among them.  This is already done
by people who have picked commonly used names.  People named John, Sean, 
and William are already dealing with the issue.  I have no objection to people
using names like "Loki the Weaver" because Loki is a name well known to have
existed in period, even if it was not in common circulation.  The addition of
the knickname, "the Weaver" serves to notify that this person is not claiming
to be the Norse god of mischief, but is merely named after him.

And people did invent names.  Maybe these names were considered odd by the
people around them, but well, most of our personas would be considered to be
odd by the people we base them on. 

I suggest that the writers of the Corpora rewrite their proposalon names to
clarify what is and is not allowed.  And that is the real key, it must be
expressed so clearly that everybody will generally agree on what's allowable
and what's not, that way people don't have to make up their own definitions,
only to run into to trouble because somebody higher up doesn't share their
understanding of what the rule means.

Since this posting is too long now, I'll pass on banishment and subjects at
this time.

Note that medieval fiction writers often made up quite fanciful names (by
the "linguistic rules" of their cultures).  There are books with lists of
such names available at more complete libraries; of course, books of "real"
medieval names reside at such libraries as well, and such names are more
easily justifiable to the heralds.  Reading through actual medieval English
documents, one of the most striking things is the lack of diversity in
names:  it seems like all men were named John, Roger, Henry or William
(+ maybe one or two others) and all women were either nameless or called
Alyce or Mary!  So perhaps a little more open-ness towards the "possible"
might be in order here, as actual practice tended towards the downright
tedious in many cultures.

Perhaps we can go to a "hereditary" system, in keeping with our "medieval"
inclinations ? :-) :-)    This overpopulation crisis would have been
amusing (had any of us foreseen it) to those at the first Coopers' Lake
Pennsic (VI), when the west half of the campground was continuously
occupied by non-SCA campers, and arriving on Thursday night brought
greetings from the dozen or so people who had gotten there earlier...

  To the assembled lord and ladies, Greetings!
 
 Addressing the first issue, (Why not one more time?) The Myth Of Carolingia.
I am but recently relocated to Carolingia from Atenveldt, I had heard one or
two rumours about general snobbery in the area, nonetheless, Society being one
of the few groups/Organisations I know I enjoy, I searched them out, and found
people that were at least as polite and helpful as anyone I have met in the
West, and more than a good many. there are differences, but they are the
differences of people from one coast to the other. At the worst I have
encountered minor aloofness, however I project that from time to time myself,
aside from being sometimes obnoxiously friendly.
 ON the Authenticity Police. Generally, Ignoring such things, is about the
most neutral position one could take. Mostly reaction should depend upon HOW
the Policia attack. If out-and-out obnoxious, I think that the best thing to
do is to simply ignore. I will stick to doing what I do, because I enjoy it.
I have had a Scot persona who lugged a Katana about(Had a good explanation
too!!), My "Alternate Persona" wears Garb more appropriate to the Greco-Roman
period, while my main persona is early C15. My favorite past encounter was the
lady who, when I arrived at an event wearing Levi's (Alas, I had nothing else)
commented: "Ah zippers! how wonderfully period!". I said nothing to this
simply chuckled and continued on, all the while wondering how she had missed
the Sony Walkman strapped to my boot.
 In response to the comment that we are not our personae, I must beg an
argument, My persona is DEFINATLLY me. In many ways. He is simply an aspect of
my personality, he is not particularly pleasant, which is why I am  not in
persona much of the time. Hmm...... That brings up a question, does anyone
  Alternate Persona. Sometimes an alternate persona is neccessary, My prime
persona does not fight, due to personal problems in his past. Ian Aelfstan
will not fight on the battlefield, however he does, not as himself, but as
another warrior, under another name, he generally wears a face guard that
conceals his identity for much the same reason he does not use his family
name. Another Question: Is this truly another persona? However , the reasons
for this are fully correct under his past. A few have noticed that there is a
similarity between the two, however one is OBVIOUSLY low born scum while the
other is a respectable lord, (Thank you people who respect this!) 
 I think I had a point when I started this, but I seem to have lost it.
(Ah! here it is! Sorry. it was buried in the lint.) 
 The basic idea is that this society exist for enjoyment, the enjoyment of
all. Anything that allows you to enjoy these Currnt Middle Ages, is good.

    Some background info: I am the Marshal of Marwick (Canton of Settmour
Swamp, East Kingdom); I am Squired to Duke Sir Ronald Wilmot; and I hold
regular fight practices.  Here's my two-cents worth about what you do with/to
beginners:
    Before any beginner even tries on someone else's armor, they must attend
several practices and just do UNARMORED slow work, the goal of which is to
build some endurance in holding up the shield, some control in swinging the
sword, and to demonstrate that they are really interested in fighting.  While
they are doing this, we are teaching them the basics of how to block, and the
basics of throwing blows.
    Some people have given up before getting into armor.  We save these people
time and money, which they would have thrown away on armor they wouldn't have
used. The ones that stick with it long enough, eventually wind up in armor (we
have some loaner gear), and if they STILL want to continue, then we help them
design and create their own armor. (Marwick also holds regular armor workshops,
also at my house.)
    To date, no one who has shown up at the Marwick practice, and persevered
through a few weeks of really basic training, and made it into armor, has then
quit.  We are proud of the fact that we turn out safe, easily authorizable
fighters.

     Things are pretty hairy around here right now, but I just couldn't
let this pass by without comment.  This reply is fairly long, fair
warning.

	   Chelidon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


          Unto my Lord Morgan,  and all the gentles of the Pennsic
     War Council,

          Chelidon o Gaerddrych does send fair greetings,


          My Good Gentles,

          I  have  read through your  proposal  regarding  camping
     space allocation at the Pennsic War.
          First and foremost,  I would like to thank you for  your
     efforts  in a most difficult and controversial  task.   Space
     allocation  has  always,  and will always be,  a  troublesome
     situation.  I applaud the effort expended by you all.

          I would like to bring up several serious reservations  I
     have with respect to your proposal:

          As  a basic overview,  I must state that in my  mind,  a
     simple  formula applies with respect to both the SCA and  the
     mundane world in general:   The more restriction and  bureau-
     cracy, the less enjoyment of the situation at hand.   Pennsic
     is my *vacation*.   In exactly the manner as the SCA  itself,
     if,  through humbug of one kind or another,  leisure activity
     reaches  a certain level of perturbation,  I will  simply  go
     elsewhere.  I get enough grief from the normal affairs of the
     world to want to deal with it in my time off.   I may be  off
     the  mark,  but I think that I am by no means alone  in  this
     philosophy.
          I of course understand that a certain amount of  regula-
     tion is necessary in any organization,  and for an event  the
     size  of  Pennsic,  a great deal of planning  must  be  done.
     Again,  for allocating some of *your* leisure time to perform
     this  planning,  I am most grateful.   My point is that  this
     "necessary" level of regulation and paperwork MUST be kept to
     an absolute minimum.

          Specific suggestions follow:


     I.   The $5.00/person site reservation fee at the time of the
     camping  site lottery unfairly discriminates  against  larger
     camping groups.   While it is fair and reasonable to expect a
     certain  amount of prior organization from  large  households
     and camping groups,  a certain percentage of the people camp-
     ing  with _any_ group will invariably be unable to get  their
     reservation  fee to whoever is handling the site lottery  for
     their group.   It would be foolish to ignore the fact that  a
     very large proportion of SCA members tend to be, like myself,
     disorganized nincompoops at times.   To deny this basic char-
     acteristic of our population is,  at best,  wishful thinking.
     For smaller groups, the amount of unpaid fees which had to be
     covered by the "space-holder" person might amount to at most,
     $30 or so.   For larger groups, however,  this total could be
     upwards of $100.   While I am willing to spend several nights
     before leaving for the war calling people who have signed  up
     to camp,  in order to confirm their names on my camp list,  I
     am not willing nor able to cover large amounts of fees out of
     my own pocket for people who, for one reason or another, were
     unable  to get their $5.00/person in by the time I  left  for
     the war.  Refusing to let these people camp with their house-
     holds, local groups, and SCA families for the duration of the
     War would be plainly unfair,  and degrade the quality of  the
     experience for many.
          I understand the purpose of the fee,  and fully  deplore
     the practice of knowingly filling one's camp roster with non-
     existent people simply in order to grab more land.   This  is
     clearly a most dishonorable practice.
          However,  by levying such a tax,  you are attempting  to
     legislate honor,  which is an endeavor doomed to failure,  in
     addition to being against the most basic spirit of the  Soci-
     ety.  If you treat people as if they have no honor, they will
     tend  not to act honorably in response to  your  legislation,
     and I think it unlikely that you will develop a system  which
     cannot be frustrated.
          If such a fee is retained,  I will be most disappointed.
     In that case,  however,  I would at least ask that the amount
     of such fees be reduced to $1.00/person.  While this may,  in
     your  judgement,  reduce the deterrent value of the  fee,  it
     would  at least reduce the inequitable discrimination  placed
     upon  large  camping  groups by such an  exercise  (as  noted
     above).
          In addition,  if such a fee is levied (call it an  Honor
     Tax, for lack of a better term), I will insist on knowing ex-
     actly what that money is used for (beyond the general "Build-
     ing Fund").   The process of adding a fee to the costs of at-
     tending  Pennsic which is not directly related to the  number
     of nights spent at the site is,  in my opinion,  a truly  bad
     precedent to set, and should be strongly discouraged.


     II.  The proposal to prohibit camping before Sunday, August 6
     (only  one week previous to the week of the War),  except  on
     the  site  of the battlefield has several  serious  flaws  as
     well.

          A.        For  those people (like myself),  with  large,
          cumbersome  encampments (I reside while at Pennsic in  a
          rather  sizable yurt,  with accompanying  detrius),  the
          thought of being forced to set up camp (an all-afternoon
          project,  at  least) three weeks before  the  War,  then
          repack a week later,  take down the yurt,  reload it  on
          the  trailer,  pull the trailer to another site,  unpack
          it,  put it up, and reestablish my household,  consuming
          at  least  an entire day of my vacation  time,  is  most
          distasteful.   In addition, there is at least one gentle
          I  know  of  who brings his equipment to the  war  in  a
          rented truck,   and who then rents the vehicle again for
          his trip home.   Are you then insisting that he rent the
          truck  yet a third time,  in order that he relocate  his
          campsite?   Now I know that what would in reality  occur
          would  be that some kind gentle would donate his or  her
          vehicle  to the project, solving the immediate  problem.
          The point I make, however, is that you must consider the
          large  amount of trouble and disarrangement you are  go-
          ing to force at least 120 people (by last year's  count,
          and  probably  more) to go through in order  to  execute
          your plan.

          B.        The  above  objections form the  least  of  my
          points on this matter.  Regardless of what I said above,
          I would be entirely willing to pick up and move my camp-
          site,  despite the trouble involved,  if this  were  the
          only consideration involved.
                    When I arrive several weeks early at the  War,
          and  spend  my  entire vacation there,  I  gain  several
          benefits  by  doing  so.   One  of  the  most  important
          of  these benefits is the relative solitude enjoyed  be-
          fore   Cooper's Lake gets too crowded.   I really  enjoy
          having   plenty of space around me for a  while,  before
          tents  fill   up most of the available space.   I  enjoy
          camping  just   under the treeline,  in order  to  enjoy
          shade during the  day, and the stars at night.   I enjoy
          an  unobstructed  view of the surrounding campsites.   I
          enjoy  the  ability   to be  secluded,  yet  visit  with
          friends   if I choose.   I  enjoy the quiet,  surrounded
          only by the  sounds of nature ,  and the mood this  puts
          me in.   I enjoy  being  within easy walking distance of
          the swimming hole  and  the lake, and being able to eas-
          ily  wander around the   vacant sites that I know,  will
          soon  be  filled with thousands of people  who  share  a
          common vision.
                    Of  course  I don't mind when the rest  of  my
          fellow   SCA   brethren  show  up,   and  I   love   the
          crowded  bustle around the barn and the merchants  area,
          meeting  friends  you  haven't  seen  for  a  year,  the
          buildup  to the weekend,  fighting for the  War  Points,
          and the sheer  impact of so many thousands of people all
          living their Dreams.  This is valuable to me, and one of
          the reasons I show up at Pennsic each year.
                    Yet equally as valuable to me is the  pleasure
          I  get in the weeks before everything gets  so  joyously
          chaotic.   If  I am forced to camp on the  flat  battle-
          field,   together with everybody else who arrived early,
          not by  choice,  but by compulsion, a large part of what
          I find  valuable in the War will have been taken away.
                    I  understand if the Coopers wish to keep  ev-
          erybody  who  arrives early together  in  one  place--it
          makes  things  much  easier for  them  logistically  and
          is  much cheaper in terms of overhead,  since they  will
          have  many  less  bathrooms  to  clean,  porta-johns  to
          empty,  etc.,  than if we were more  widely  distributed
          throughout  the grounds,   and they will also get a  few
          extra   weeks to  make ready the regular campsites  than
          they are used to.  Yet,  when I  arrive early, I am pay-
          ing  the same rate as for  my  regular campsite,  though
          the  site  you  say will be available is  a  great  deal
          less  desirable  to me.   I would be   willing   to  pay
          an  increased  daily camping fee for the   time  leading
          up to  August 6,   if this enables the Coopers to   open
          the  normal camping areas at the usual time.


          I realized how long this is getting, and though I have a
     number of additional points,  I will end my letter here.   If
     you  have any questions regarding my opinions,  feel free  to
     contact me, either through this account, or at home.

          In conclusion I'd like to add that,  although I feel the
     addition of further administrative procedures and regulations
     to the Pennsic War is a bad thing,  I would be willing to put
     up with the lottery system under certain conditions.   I per-
     sonally feel that there is nothing wrong in there being  cer-
     tain benefits in arriving "early" at the War.  If a person is
     able,  and willing,  to spend several weeks at Cooper's Lake,
     possibly  forgoing  salary during that period,  paying  addi-
     tional  camping  fees,  and living in a tent for weeks  at  a
     time,  why SHOULDN'T they have a greater selection of camping
     spaces then someone who arrives later?  SCA members shouldn't
     be penalized for wanting to arrive at the War early.  Many of
     us would arrive much earlier than we do, if our circumstances
     were different.  Many others of us are willing to accept cer-
     tain mundane penalties in order to achieve this goal.

          Yet,  I acknowledge that some people have problems  with
     the  way land distribution has been handled in the past.   As
     stated above, I see nothing wrong with certain advantages ac-
     cruing  to those who are able and willing to make the  sacri-
     fices necessary to arrive early at the War.  For those groups
     who have as a member a person who is able and willing to make
     those sacrifices,  or who are willing to sponsor a person  to
     do  so,  I see no problem with that group  getting  a  larger
     choice of sites than other groups.   What I find unacceptable
     is  any group taking more space than it really needs.   Grab-
     bing  additional  camping space at the expense of  others  is
     clearly dishonorable.   However,  camping space should be  at
     slightly less of a premium,  since the entire wood where  the
     Woods battle was previously held will be available for  camp-
     ing this year.

                    *         *         *         *

          I firmly believe that a fair and equitable  distribution
     of  camping land can be gained simply by requiring a list  of
     people  camping with each group,  as was done last year.   In
     addition, it must be made clear that during the War,  Encamp-
     ment Captains will visit each group,  and check their  lists.
     Camps would be required to show proof that a substantial num-
     ber  of the people on the list were actually there,  by  pre-
     senting numbered "camping tags"  which every person would  be
     given upon check-in at the Troll Booth,  in addition to their
     personal tags.   Groups unable to show such proof would  have
     their  site size reduced,  and the extra space would be  made
     available  for arriving gentles.   The decisions of the  Cap-
     tains would be final, with perhaps some form of appeal avail-
     able directly to the War Autocrat or a Deputy.   In addition,
     setting aside some reasonably agreeable area for single camp-
     ers  who  are not affiliated with any group is  a  very  good
     idea.   Groups can usually afford to send someone to the  war
     early,   if  no  individual  in  the  group  can  do  so   by
     his/herself.   Individuals do not have that option, so should
     be   given   an   alternative  to  camping   in   the   least
     desirable/accessible spots.

                    *         *         *         *

          Such a system would be infinitely preferable to any form
     of site lottery.  With a lottery system, discontent would not
     necessarily  be reduced,  but instead of some people  feeling
     general discontent at "those land grabbers,"  you will have a
     directed  discontent aimed at the people who  legislated  the
     situation, the same people who have the enormous task of run-
     ning the War.  If a few people at the War feel that they have
     been done an injustice by another group, no real serious harm
     is done to the War as a whole, and the groups can discuss the
     problem  if necessary between themselves.   If enough  people
     have the attitude that they have been wronged by the  persons
     "in authority," you have a situation where the efforts of the
     people  trying to keep the War running smoothly will be  hin-
     dered.  This would be a Bad Thing.  The job's tough enough as
     it is.

          This  lottery  system  changes nothing  as  far  as  the
     "Pennsic Land Grab"  goes,  except to eliminate the advantage
     of arriving more than a week before the war.  I disagree with
     the reasoning behind this move, and I most strongly  disagree
     with the penalties exacted upon people who want to spend more
     than two weeks at Pennsic.  In particular,  forcing everybody
     who arrives early to camp on a flat hot field with  everybody
     else who arrives early, and then forcing these people to pick
     up and move their campsites is indefensible.

          Please  consider  the  opinions  I  have  attempted   to
     present, and again, feel free to contact me for any reason.

                    In service to the collective vision,

Subject: Pennsic War: space allocation, etc.

Hi Folks;

  As it turns out, I am one of the East Kingdom's two representatives on the
Pennsic War Council, which is a group charged with coming up with clever ideas
to smooth the operation of Pennsic.  (I shudder to admit it on the net, but I
am also the seneschal of the soon-to-be Principality of the Lakes, if you want
to yell at me about that).  This council had a meeting at Cooper's Lake last
Saturday, April 29, and we think we came up with some good ideas.  I will post
a full summary when I get the official minutes from Claire FitzWilliam, the
autocrat, but I noticed that Dani had made a post about some of the stuff we
discussed at the meeting ("Pennsic Campsite Allocation Policy", 3 May 89), so
I thought I should throw in a semi-official version.  PLEASE NOTE THAT WHAT
FOLLOWS IS NOT OFFICIAL OR CERTAIN; as I say I don't have the minutes of the
meeting yet and my recollection may be incorrect, or some other circumstance
may force a change.  Until Claire officially announces a plan, nothing is set
in stone.

If you want to correspond with me about this stuff or anything else, please do;
I get mail at welling@morgul.psc.edu or welling@cpwpsca on bitnet.  Please
mention the SCA in the subject line, so I can tell the mail isn't work-related.

Of course, the hot topic is the space allocation policy.  Last year things got
rather out of hand;  we want to prevent that this year.  The Coopers also want
to put a stop to this business of people showing up earlier and earlier, year
after year, to reserve space.

We agree that, as usual, there will be the traditional block reserved for royal
encampments.  I *believe* we also agreed that there would be some space held
for last-minute, single-tent walk-ons.  All the rest of the space will be
assigned by lottery.

Before Sunday, August 6, SCA people will only be allowed to camp on the
battlefield.  There will be no SCA encampments in the areas where all the
tents will ultimately go.  This is to make it easier for the Coopers to do
things like mowing of the camping area, and to discourage people from coming
much earlier than that.

From some time Saturday August 5 until noon Sunday, August 6, groups will
register for the lottery.  A group is a list of people;  no person should
belong to more than one group and no group may register more than once.
There is a 5 dollar fee for each person not yet in attendence in each group;
that fee is to be paid when the group registers and goes directly into the 
building fund.  Obviously, the fee is to prevent people from registering many
times and to prevent groups from pumping up their rolls with non-existant or
unlikely people.  We argued long and hard to find a fee that would discourage
these things without being an unbearable burden on some people, and it's not
clear that we found one, but we felt something was needed.

At about 1:00 Sunday, they will start drawing the names of large groups;  as
each group is called it can go rope off an appropriate amount of space.  When
the large groups are done grabbing space, the small groups will be drawn in a
separate lottery.  There were about 120 people on-site at this point last year,
so that should give you a rough idea of how many groups will be participating.

Obviously, the purpose of the lottery is to make sure there is no advantage to
arriving early- as long as your group's name is in the hat when the lottery is
drawn, you have an equal chance at the good sites.  We are drawing in two
groups in order to improve the packing efficiency of the camping space.  It
seems clear that one wants to rope off the larger areas first, just as one
wants to put the large pieces of armor in a duffle bag first, or allocate the
large chunks of memory first.  The cut-off between large and small groups is
likely to be a group size of about 30 people, but this is *not* a hard figure. 
Ideally half the groups would fall in the 'large' class and the other half
would be 'small'; if the cut-off of thirty produces a split which is too far
from this we will arbitrarily and without warning change the number.

Hopefully, people will have sat round on Saturday night and worked out a nice,
peaceful partition of the camping space between themselves.  We will provide
maps to help this along.  It's our hope that this discussion period will give
groups a chance to keep their traditional sites.  The lottery is there to be
the final arbiter of any disputes;  nothing would please us more than to have
all the space allocations planned out before the first ping-pong ball is drawn.

The following Sunday, August 13, an assigned enforcer and a hand-picked band of
Dukes and other ruffians will go through the site, compacting encampments that
can't demonstrate that they're using their space reasonably efficiently.  We
hope that this will provide some additional space for new arrivals.  

And that's the plan.  Any comments would be much appreciated;  I will pass them
on to the powers that be.  There should be very little trouble with crowding,
both because of this new system and because the Coopers are making a good deal
of new camping land available this year.  There will be more tent space than
there has been in the past.

In other news (you will like this, I think), the Woods Battle is in a
completely new piece of woods this year.  It's state park land;  if you go up
the causeway and then fail to make the left up toward the high meadows you
enter it.  There is a plug of brush there, and then the old railway path
resumes and runs for some distance.  It's a great area, and substantially
larger than the current woods.  My understanding is that all the old woods is
to be available for camping.

Hope that helps,

	If someone has the ability to play a certain role, and wants
to do so, should they not be able to have the name to match?  Why
should what they are called in court differ from their persona?  Also,
how historically acurate must these names be is also a question that
enters my mind, as I think I asked before...

	Hmm, send along a few, I am currently trying to figure out who
I want to become in the SCA.

	Sounds like this happens only after a serious offense,

Message-Id: <11522@well.UUCP>


Greetings from Hal Ravn:

I know people at a small company that records tapes.  Most of what
they've done is filk, with some historical--i.e. "Lovers, Heros and
Rogues" by Moonwulf and some of Juanita Coulson's stuff.  *If* there
is a market for it, they could probably be persuaded to record tapes
of dance music at the right tempo with long cuts.  Just how much
interest is there in such tapes with professional recording quality?
Their normal market amount to 500 to 1000 copies of one tape.  They'd
also be willing to a "vanity press" tape if the market isn't big
enough to warrant production from their stand point.  How about it
people--just how desparate are you for period dance music?

Subject: Crowns and offices - do they mix?
Message-Id: <11529@well.UUCP>


Greetings from Hal Ravn:

Before we get too deeply into the question of Royalty holding offices,
I'd like to make a couple of comments.

Part of the problem here is that the amount of work--and length of time--
varies a good bit between Kingdoms.  Note that, for example, the West 
has 3 reigns a year (the only Kingdom to do so as far as I know), and
therefore our Kings and Queens serve for a *total* of only 6 months.

We also have Princes that are not heirs to the Kingdom thrones.  The
only other groups with experience that way are the Kingdoms that formed
by separating from existing Kingdoms.  As I understand, the East (isn't it?)
is about to form an internal Principality, but the West is the only Kingdom
with long-term experience this way.  The Prince's of the Mists and 
Cynagua (and--I presume--Oertha and Lochac) have 6-month reigns, for
a total of about 9 months official involvement.  They have rather fewer
demands on their that (outside observation) than the King and Queen.

Therefore, it seems to me that a King or Queen could well turn over
any but a Great Office of State to a Deputy (under supervision) for
the duration of a Reign and a Prince or Princess could probably do the
same--with the caveat that this also applies to Principality offices.

In Kingdoms with longer Regins--especially where the Crown Tourney is
held closely following Coronation--this may not be practical.

Perhaps all of the discussions on the Corpora should start with a
discussion about differences among the Laurel Kingdoms.  We're not
all *that* homogenous, you know.

   Why not? I have a friend who would like to use the name "Fern", as this

This one, I have a bit of a personal experience with - here in An Tir we
had an unpleasant experience with a man (please note, the omission of the
word "gentle" is deliberate) who didn't understand the word "no".  Especially
in regards to his conduct with the company of a lady.  The actions required
in this case were apparent.  The first time, he had been warned, even the
second time (actually being ousted by his clan) and lastly, he was asked
to leave.  All this occured before this individual was able to do any 
*real* harm... just scared a couple of ladies.  As far as I am aware, I
don't think he will be returning again.  (Please, don't ask me to elaborate
much more on this case, see that would not be meet)

This is the kind of case that *should* be banished, but then, I feel that
this was obvious.  Proven theft...maybe (Especially if they've thieved 
`me ALE! :-) circumstances taken into account -  Banishment is a pretty
hard sentence. I think it should be reserved for the most severe cases.

In order to prevent any further confusion/misunderstanding, I will post the

Subject: Period names and Personas
Message-Id: <20255@uflorida.cis.ufl.EDU>

Unto Luwenth the Leud, fair greeting from Majir the Blatant! ;)

I suppose the best place to start is to say, Hey! slow down a second.
It's been said before, I'll say it once more - you are only *required*
(and even that might be too strong a word) to make an *attempt* at
period garb.  Nothing about names or personas.  It took me 5 years to
settle on a period name and persona.  It wasn't that important to me
before then.  When I decided it was time to create one, it just all
fell together from all the things I learned and all the opinions I
developed those first five years.  A little research filled out the
details and pulled it together.

The name I finally chose is Marie Eve Clouet and yes, it is different from
Majir the Blatant.  When I arrived at my first even, I was asked "What do
we call you?"  I wanted to be called something different than my real name
but something close enough to it that I would recognize when someone was
calling to me.  Majir is just Marji with the letters switched.  It's made
up, absolutely and completely.  I TRIED to find some *real, period* name
that came close to it and failed.  When I was apprenticed not too long ago,
I was called up in court as Marie Eve - but I will *always* be known as
Majir.  One can even take the case one step further - My first name is
Marjorie but I can't tell you the last time anyone called me that.  It's
usually Marj or Marji.  Legally, i.e., driver's license and pay checks, 
I am Marjorie.

As for how serious your persona gets, that's up to you.  I wear the style
of clothes that an upper class/noble woman living in the late 1500s, early
1600s would wear.  I suppose if I fought, I would attempt to wear the
armor that would have been used at that time as well.  However, while
I have two younger sisters, Marie Eve has two older brothers and no sisters
at all.  Those brothers are purely imaginary - I have no friends in the
SCA whose personas are those of Marie Eve's brothers.  One of my sisters
is in the SCA, within the same barony at that, but there is no relation
between her persona and mine.

Creating a solid, period persona is a lot of work for ANYONE in the SCA,
old or new.  "Oldcomers" just know the research ropes a little better, I
suppose.  I suppose it also depends on whether you want a serious persona
or a less serious, social type.  Majir the Blatant has a bit of persona,
but it doesn't hold much water...

I think it would be nice if we could make up our own names and such (I
really like the name Majir) but who becomes the arbiter of what maintains
period ambience and what doesn't?  By limiting name registration to what
can be documented, we escape a lot of problems.  I think that this is the
most practical thing to do.

So relax a little, Luwenth.  You don't get kicked out of the SCA if you
don't have a water-tight persona worked up in six months :-)  It's also
much more satisfying if you create a persona because _you want to_ than
because someone expects it of you.  Pardon the expression, but you're the
one who has to sleep with it...

Yours in long-winded service,

Lady Marie Eve Clouet
or just li'l `ol me, Majir the Blatant

Subject: Poetic Form
Message-Id: <8208@pucc.Princeton.EDU>

Last night, M'lady Dorigen asked me to read some Hebrew poetry to
ascertain whether it was, in fact, a sonnet. (As it turned out it
was: a 1221, 1221, 345345 type.)  While reading, I noticed that the author
had split a word in two at the end of a line in order to maintain
rythm and rhyme scheme.  I pointed this out to Dorigen, and she said
that this was the first time she had seen anything like it in period
poetry--although the practice is not unknown today.  (Dorigen is a laurel
in poetry.)  My question is: Does anyone know of any other period poetry
that does this?  Even more specific, does anyone know any period Sonnets
that do it? The poet in question was Emanuel of Rome and he lived, I think,
during the 13th century. (The poem was 'Regarding her Eyes')

)[M'lord describes some period tales that could offend modern

)The question I am raising is whether your opposition to censorship
)applies to what would currently be labelled racism and sexism as well
)as to bawdry? Should I tell my stories straight, censor them, or only
)tell the ones not too offensive to modern taste?

	A good question, and one that strains the limits of our
ability to act in persona.  Not being part of a group that 
is sensitive to such things (southern hillbillys being made fun of
but seldom laughed at, and the amerind side being too remote to
hurt on those few occations where I do run into that kind of prejudice) 
I can't tell how such stories would be taken.  The only solution that
comes to mind is to step out of persona for a moment to point out
that the following is a period tale that some may find offensive, 
but I can also understand why this is offensive to Lord Cariadoc.
Short of this I see only two real choices, to tell or not to tell.
(With the side note that censoring them would involve removing much
of the story in some cases, and censoring them by merely changing the
stereotypes involved isn't a solution.  I don't think either is aesthetically
pleasing to the storytelling side of *me*.)
	
	My personal inclination would be to go ahead and tell them.  If
need be, have someone 'planted' in the crowd to raise, if possible, these
objections in a (non-violent!) period manner.  You can then gage the
reaction of the crowd to the tale and to the person objecting and decide
if it is best to continue or move on to another tale.

	I think that storytellers in period, particularly ones outside of
their own country, faced something of the same problem.  There, however,
it would have been easier to shift the maligned group in the case of 
racist stories. (Sexist tales probably required no such modification...
unless you were performing for Elisabeth!)(And I'm not even certain then.)
In period the storyteller would have simply chosen different tales for
different crowds.  I fear that you'll have to do something simular here too.


)One consequence is that, when I recite a poem (by Malkin) containing
)a reference to Odin, I immediately follow it by an "explanation"
)interpreting Odin as a Djinn or Demon, who the Northmen falsely
)believe to be a God--not only is such an explanation (I think)
)appropriate to my persona, it may be necessary to cover myself
)against accusations of heresy or blasphemy. On one occasion I got a
)very hostile reaction from a Norse persona, along the lines of "I
)don't say nasty things about your god, you shouldn't say them about
)mine." It was fairly clear that the reaction was coming out of 20th
)century ideas of religious toleration. The question I want to raise
)is whether expressing intolerant views on religion is appropriate as
)a reflection of what our personae would have been like, 
)or whether it is behavior that should be self-censored so
)as not to offend modern sensibilities.
	
	Again, I would say that the period storyteller had much the same
problem.  There are a lot of Norse persona's in the SCA, would a period
storyteller use those words knowing that the crowd contained some of these
hot-headed, dangerous (and potentially cannibalistic!) people?  Perhaps
phrasing it so that the heathen can laugh knowingly at your ignorance of
the power of Odin while making it clear that your faith is in Allah would
be an appropriate responce.

Subject: Dolmetsch

Margaret MacDubhSidhe asks about "Dances of England and France, 1450-
1600" by Mabel Dolmetsch.  Well, use it if you can't find anything
else but...
Dolmetsch was a very early redactor of period dances.  There wasn't
much prior research for her to work from, and she invented a lot.
It is probably better to use her material than not dance at all,
but Arbeau isn't that hard to come by or make some sense out of.

It would be better to track down some of the simpler period sources
and interpret for yourself - it isn't all that hard, and the learning
process can be quite interesting.  I would suggest finding a copy
of "Orchesography" by Thoinot Arbeau (it is available in paperback
from Dover) or "Dancing at the Inns of Court" by James Cunningham,
which contains the original manuscript for a number of almans and
pavans, as well as commentary, as a good place to start.  I don't
have my list of sources here at work to give publishers and such,
but these shouldn't be too hard to track down.

One of the interesting classes promised (threatened?) for a collegium
to be held in Storvik (Washington, DC) in September is to distribute
the text of a period dance to several different people/groups of people,
for each to interpret separately.  Then we will see how similar/different
each version is.  This should be lots of fun, and very educational...

What we've been doing every year has been a charging-man shoot with

50, 60 and 70.  As near as I can figure out, the geometry is a mess.

and get you the info.

	Something you can do, without even leaving your school, is simply to
go to the library and see what heraldic and name and language sources
exist there.  I've found that most libraries have something interesting,
even, at times, things that better stocked libraries may have missed.
I've found three interesting sources that I'm exploiting now, a previously
unseen armorial, a book (looks like someones thesis) on the origins of
nicknames found in the tax rolls of Warwickshire (which proved to be the
crutial point in getting my name approved by the kingdom college of arms)
and a complete (through 1904 or so) list of knights made in England, with
date and order and an occational comment or two.  As Princeton has a wonderful
library I'm sure I`ve just scratched the surface (I haven't even looked at the
language dictionaries, which I understand includes one on Manx!)  And at that
I recall a book or two I saw at the University of Kentucky that I'd like to
get my hands on today.  Check your local library.

eight people coming to the workouts and dropping to just the one person
within a couple of months (before he started armored combat training.)
He also had a useful background in one marshall art, useful in that 
his sensei had done an excellent job of teaching him basics such as 
stance and *why* that stance worked... making it easier to teach him 
new things.  His sensei had also worked on exicution with his students,
drilling them with basics for far longer than most, until they really
were nearly automatic.  This also helped with Guseppi's training.

	Indeed, the group I've been training here are probably *very*
tired of the unarmored stance and delivery drills, but until they
get some armor or we get them to some loaner armor we're stuck.  I think
only one of them could wear my helm, and she's been too busy with classes

	Indeed, I'm fairly certain it would not, as it was very individual-
ized.  But as we had 8 start (and then find other "things I need to do"
though some simply left the area to go to college) and only one get to the
point where the training I described was needed, it worked ok.  If it was
a case where there were more people I'm certain that the technique would
have changed.  I would have probably have gone to a system more like what
was used in my fencing classes in college, having the students working
with each other on drills and such, and much less personal attention.  But
that is something a group marshal can't always provide, personal training,
and why squiring to a Knight is often attractive, returning service for
training that you can't get anywhere else. (Not to mention the fact that,
at least in my case, you can learn a lot more with the knight!!  :-)

bestows no order of precedence on the wearer, nor does it admit him/her into 
any order.  There is definitely a relationship between knight and squire, 
although there are probably as many definitions of it as there are 
knight-squire relationships in the SCA.  All we've done is take one, specific
form (the red belt) and indicate that it represents one, specific type of
relationship.

RE : Chain-mail Bikinis.
	I confess I've never made one, however if I was to take a stab at
it, I'd make the top pieces of two coifs, fasten them together, add a strap 
and build it up from there.  I'd recommend making a padded bikini to wear under
it.  Perhaps you could cover the edges with rabbit fur or something.  Carrie 
Fischer (Princess Leia from "Star Wars") complained that the "brass brassiere" 
she wore as Jabba the Hut's slavegirl roasted her breasts in the hot sun.  
Wendy Pini (the Elfquest artist) has a chainmail bikini that she wears when
she does her Red Sonja impersonation at SF-cons.  One time several of her
"friends" stuffed it in the ice-machine for an hour just before she was to
wear it in a costume show.  They used a candle to warm the straps, the part
she would grab it by, back up to room temperature.  The rest of it was still
ice-cold.  The announcer was introducing another contestant when suddenly
everybody heard this loud whoop.  He grinned evilily and said, "The real
Red Sonja wouldn't have let her bikini get stuffed in the ice machine." and
then continued on with the contest as if nothing had happened.

	To The Queen's Taste by Lorna Sass (still more cooking)
	The Housewife's Jewel by ??

look at me... I've been in the Society for more than 8 years, gotten
awards and so on, which a completely non-period name.  This is pushing

Even so, I'm living proof that not having a "real" name doesn't

Subject: Rialto badges
Message-Id: <9539@watcgl.waterloo.edu>

Unto the great and wise folk of the Rialto, Arnora Dunestan sends her best
wishes...

There's been a great deal of talk on the net lately about a gathering of the    Rialto folk at Pennsic this year.  My lord Ragnar Thorbergsson and I have
been in touch with Lady Ariel on the subject, and are both in favour of such
a gathering.  The point I wish to open for Rialto discussion is this :
Both my lord and I wear emblems I made myself, with a piece of netting on a
badge, with the word "Rialto" embroidered underneath.  What would the general
consensus be if I was to take ideas for a badge for all the Rialto folk ?
We have been bantering about the idea for a while here, and have opted for
the following design (forgive my lack of appropriate heraldic terminology) :
On a field azure, a net or, in base the text "Rialto", (possibly with the
date next to it.)  This is the design as it currently sits, but I am flexible
and open to ideas of interest warrants it.  I will look into prices here
immediately, so if you wish to order any, you can either let me know at
kbmurph@watcsc, or at nnpeterson@watcgl.

I know that there are several of my esteemed contacts in the Rialto who have
voiced the worry that the Rialto is too strongly resembling a "secret
society", and I concur with the worries.  These badges are not intended
to be used as devices for such a society, merely as an easy, semi-formal
method for recognizing each other at events. (one of the beautiful aspects of
being Canadian and SCAdian is that there are very, VERY few net contacts, so
everyone asks about the emblem I currently wear !!!)      

These badges, should the idea be acceptable enough to make it worth my while,
will be available at Pennsic.  I will be there under the banner of ...
hmm, not sure at the moment whose... well, I'll be there under SOMEBODY'S
banner.  I will be certain to look up those who have placed orders no matter
what.

Never done it before with holes, but as one who bakes inside his
leather body armor this sounds like a good idea to me. My only
concern would be whether adding enough grommets to do any good 
temperature-wise wouldn't add too much extra weight.

> Anybody made boiled leather and want to give me advice?

Quick run-down on how to boil leather (at least my technique).
Make a double-boiler type arrangement with pans that your
leather pieces will fit in. Use paraffin as the wax. I added
Stearic Acid (I think that's right) as a hardener so that the
wax won't leach out of the leather later due to heat. I've
also heard of people using candle-wax hardener, but I don't
know what this is. Bring the double boiler up to a temperature
where the pariffin is melted (it will become very clear) but not
boiling. Submerge the leather piece completely in the wax until
the bubbles stop. At this point the pores in the leather are
full (if I understand the principles correctly). Take the piece
out, let the wax drip off, then form it and place it in the
freezer. You may have to put it in the freezer briefly before
forming it as leather directly out of the boiler is very soft
and won't hold a shape. Some hints: Dye the leather first, and
experiment with some test pieces for color. My cheap leather 
didn't take the black dye too well, but the Cuir Bouilli
(boiling in wax) process really made the black deep and dark.
Second: Pieces too large to fit entirely in the wax can be
worked through from one side to another as long as each area
is in the wax long enough to stop bubbling (tiny bubbles btw).

Most sewing/material places have silver grommets although these
tend to be on the small size. I've gotten large silver grommets at
army surplus places. Look in the tent area...

This has gotten long, but let me close with a plug for Cour Bouilli
armor. I made mine maybe 6 years ago and it has held up
tremendously since. It is still very hard and provides as much 
protection as steel. If you don't have the skills or facilities
to work in metal, boiled leather is a great alternative. It is
even a valid first choice for much early and transitional period
armour.

I must disagree, my lord Sirhan.  The SCA is a medieval recreation
group.  It is perfectly reasonable to require each member of the
Society to conform to that definition at least to the extent of taking
the effort to choose a correctly formed, medieval name.  For someone
new to the SCA, this process requires about an hour's work checking a
history book or two, or a good name dictionary, and finding a name
which is existed the Middle Ages.  The problems arise, almost
uniformly, when people fail to do take that basic step.

An additional problem arises from the phrase "proper period and
cultural ambience".  How on Earth is this to be defined?  The current
College of Arms policy boils down, essentially, to "if you can
document it, it's acceptable.  If not, then not."  What is an
objective definition of "proper period and cultural ambience"?  Who
gets to decide if it "sounds medieval"?  The choice really appears to
come to having standards for medieval names, or having no standards at
all. 

Finally, I would like to note that you have stated a common
misconception:

In modern America, it is certainly the case that parents can name
their children anything they want, and often make-up names with no
basis at all.  This was not the case in most times, in most places.
In particular, it is not true today in many countries, where a child's
name may need legal approval (France, USSR, Argentina, and any who is
Catholic), nor was it true in medieval Europe.  Names formed a
distinct class of words in each language, and it was very rare for
names to be added to that stock.  There was some variation, but it was
not random: It followed certain linguistic rules in each culture.  As
the SCA is trying to recreate those cultures, their naming systems are
something we should at least try to use.

Greetings!

The second draft of the new Rules for Heraldic Submissions has been
mailed to the College of Arms for commentary.  I will be sending
copies to commenting heralds in the East, and I suspect some other
Principal Heralds will do the same in their kingdoms.  If you wish to
get a copy and comment on it, I urge you to contact your principal
herald.  The more commentary Mistress Alisoun receives the better the
final rules will be.  This draft is scheduled for about 6 weeks of
review, after which a second draft will be issued for final review &
comment.  The new rules will be presented ot the BoD for their
approval at the October meeting.

The new rules represents a substantial simplification and
re-organization of the existing rules.  Many special cases have been
eliminated or merged into existing rules, and the document as a whole
is much more readable.  The most significant simplification is the
wholescale elimination of the major/minor point method of counting
difference between pieces of armory. It has been replaced by a system
which requires two differences, each of which would have been
sufficient for primary cadency in periuod heraldry.  The draft of the
rules proposes a list of the types of changes which would count as
such differences.  No more must every pursuivant take a course in
differential heraldic calculus!

I will try to get a copy of the text of the rules onto the net.  If I
do, I will let you all know, and will be happy to mail out copies.

I recently found a book in the library titled "Dances of England and
France 1450-1600", by Mabel Dolmetsch, published in 1949.  It contains
such curiousities as the Earl of Salisbury Pavan and Galliard (with
music for each), several basse dances, pavans, galliards, the coronto,
la volta, and most of the branles from arbeau.

It gives, in full, "The Manner to Dance Bace Dances" by Robert Coplande
(circa 1521), as well as many other period references, and provides
music for most of the dances.  The text indicates where the music has
been arranged by the author, and where it is original from a manuscript.
 It also provides a short bibliography of source material.

Is anyone familiar with this work, and can they provide me with
additional information about the author, and other works in this vein? 
(Apparently she also wrote books on Spanish and Italian dances of the
day). 

Thanks to all!

To Dani and Cariadoc: Thanks for posting the information on Pennsic.  Pardon
me if I heave two or three big sighs at the prospect of the land lottery,
though.  I admit something has to be done about the land grab, and that some
system is better than none, but still... It looks as though the only people
who will ever get a decent place to camp are those who don't have to work
during the month of August.

Whatever are we going to do?  In my shire we're thinking about drawing straws
to see who has to make the trip out early so we can get a place to camp.  Last
year we had 100 people in our camp, from 10 different groups.  This year, we'll
be up a creek if we can't get someone to get out there two weeks ahead of 
everyone else.  And will it be three weeks next year?  Four?

To Cher de Bellevue: Cariadoc is the person to talk to about Digbie and other
period cookbooks.  (Cariadoc: Have any new ones this year?  Bring extra copies
of your Miscellany, too, because everyone who's seen my copy wants one.)

To Richard de Lacy: Welcome back!

On the new Corpora: 

Does the question on residency affect just one's Kingdom of residence, or does
it ask about the territory (shire, barony, etc.)?

On non-period, invented names and names from fiction: If you wanted to be a
real weenie about it, you could document most of Tolkien's names from Old
Finnish, Anglo-Saxon, or any of the other languages he used as a basis for
his languages.  I object to names from fiction (we have a few of these already,
but they've been going by those names since AS 2), personally, but see very
little wrong with a name that has a period "ambiance" about it.  The only
question I have as an ex-herald is: How does one judge "ambiance?"  What may
sound pretty okay to me may sound horrendous to the next herald.

On restricting the Crown and Consort from holding any offices at all during
their reign: This worries me, partly because it makes sense, and partly because
it forces some of us to choose between service to the group and service to the
Kingdom.  If I ran the circus, I would probably concede that Kingdom offices
and major group offices (seneschal, herald, marshal, A&S officer, exchequer)
might take up too much time, but I really can't see that archery captain,
chatelaine, lists officer, etc. constitute a huge drain on one's energy.  (I
admit I'm biased, and since I've never been on the throne, I could be very
wrong.  Still, I love doing our shire's newsletter and would have a hard time
giving it up if I became Queen sometime.)

Would the ex-Royalty on the Rialto be so kind as to tell me what it's really
like?  Does the restriction really make sense, or would you object to being
shut out of things you really like to do?  What if you're nearly irreplaceable?
(I said NEARLY.)  What if you're the fifth officer in a 5-person group?  Is it
fair to dissolve the group because one of them is Royalty?

I have discovered, from my own experience, that the fantasy (dream,
whatever you wish to call it) is much better for me when I know
that what I am doing could have happened, and probably did.
Admitedly, in my case, research wasn't a problem.  I was interested
in Medieval history long before I joined the SCA.  When I signed
up, I knew exactly who I wanted to be, since I had already
invested considerable day-dream time on said personality.  When I
got involved in the SCA, I went and did some more research (for fun).
As a result, I can document my persona's history.  Not as the life
of any ONE person, but taking possibilities from several simultaneous
personalities.
Example- My persona was born in Kai-Feng Foo, and resides in Southern
France of 1050 or so. Impossible?  No.  There existed a large Jewish
Community in Kai-Feng, which traded heavily with Indian-Jewish
Communities in Calcutta, Madras, and other major ports along the
coast of India and Persia.  These communities traded with Jewish
communities in Cairo.  From Cairo, trade branched throughout the
Islamic World and into Southern Europe.  All the trade families were
in some way or another related to their trading partners (distant
cousins, occasionally reinforced by marraige).  All my persona did
was keep going along the trade route instead of stopping at the next
port.  Unlikely, but not impossible.

Same here. In fact, I would like to take this on step
further.  I am soon to return to Charolingia (my home town of Boston),
but my entire SCA existance so far has been spent in Carillion (sort of
central Jersey).  As a result, I would like to maintain some kind
of leige-loyalty to the Baron of Carillion.  How?
(A neat aspect of all this is mariages accross Barony lines.
In period times, this was only possible with permission of the local
nobility.  A good source of court-schtick possibly?)

Subject: Living in one Kingdom and being loyal to another


 
Greetings to the Rialto from Debhain Argonon.
 
I have been reading the SCAnet for some time, holding my peace all the
while.  But this is a topic on which I must speak.
 
I am a college student, and, as such, I move around alot.  I started in
the SCA in the East Kingdom, am now in the West Kingdom, and will be in the
fall (God willing) in the Midrealm.  Does this mean that I have to switch
loyalties each time I switch schools?  I should think not.  What good would
my Honor be if I switched loyalties every few years?  Instead, I have added
the quality of Mercenary to my persona.  My (SCA) family lives in the East
and to them lies my ultimate loyalty, but in the mean time, I serve who ever
pays the rent, so to speak.
 
I may have chosen this path to peace for the internal conflict of shifting 
loyalties, but I invite each of you to find your own way.
(Or do what I did. See if I care.:-)
 
 
 
					In sevice to my Clan,
						  to my Chief,
						  to the rest of my family,
						and to who ever pays
						the bills for my mercenaries,

The question is what is meant by "proper period and cultural ambience". This is
a fudge sentence that could mean almost anything. In my interpretation, it
covers the system we have now. You don't need to document that there existed
a person with exactly the name you want. Spelling is optional. But in a dif-
ferent interpretation, the above fudge could open the way for monstrosities.
There are enough of those already...

Well, after eight years, you were hardly a newcomer any more. Getting names
past is a problem if you can't document it - but it's not a treshold for
newcomers unless they themselves choose to see it that way. The potential for
problems will remain as long as we have *any* rules about names, because there
will always be someone who wants something that's not allowed. The present
rules have the good side effect of forcing people to learn a little about
medieval names, if they want to register one. But nobody is forced to do that
in order to participate in the SCA.

>Also, the process of naming people is a very subjective thing. Parents have

Again, I disagre There were strong traditions about names in the Middle Ages,
much stronger than today. Parents would choose the names carefully according
to their cultural traditions. Sometimes the name was thought to have an
almost magical meaning, giving the child the qualities of the person they
were being named after (or of an animal, e.g. Biorn = bear). Other practices
existed, such as the Germanic/Scandinavian variation system (see my article
in the Compleat Anachronist #36).

If we are here to re-create and learn about medieval culture, then we should
follow those traditions as best we can. I can see so reason not to do it,
except perhaps if a person is not interested in the middle ages, in which case
he/she doesn't belong here anyway.

>So long as people are not actually claiming to be the fictitious character I 
>do not see the harm in using the name.

Well, if I meet a "Gandalf Grey" or an "Arwen Undomiel", I will certainly
think of the fictional characters, regardless of who the bearer of the name
is claiming to be. The reference to the book is there and cannot be avoided.
I prefer to keep my elves and hobbits in the local Tolkien group, and to 
make a difference between fictional characters from medieval literature and
the "real people" that we ourselves are supposed to be.

>I feel that one should be allowed to be considered the subject of the
>kingdom that one calls home.

I would like to agree. Every person has a place where he considers himself
to belong. American military personnel who live in Europe remain Americans.
People will not resign their citizenship until they feel more at home
somewhere else.

But medieval kingdoms were not nations in the modern sense. Nobility was
international. For a nobleman, the most important fact was *who* his liege
lord was. A "foreigner" was a person with bonds of fealty to the king of
another realm. And fealty had consequences other than keeping the emotional
bonds to one's homeplace.

There are four options, if you are living in Awayland but feel like you
belong to Homeland:
a.) Swear fealty to the king of Homeland only.
b.) Swear fealty to the king of Awayland only.
c.) Swear fealty to both kings.
d.) Don't swear fealty.

The a.) option means you remain a foreigner in Awayland. You cannot hold
office there, or receive peerage from its king. Also, this option would
not be open to just anyone. An Awayish noble couldn't just decide to
swear fealty to the king of Homeland, in order to escape the Awayish
king - that would be treason.
In the a.) option, the noble woulbe in trouble if there was a war with
Homeland. He would suddenly find himself an enemy of the land where he is
living, his property will be confiscated and himself will be taken hostage.

The b.) option is the least complicated one. The noble simply becomes a
subject of a different country, with all the duties and privileges 
appertaining thereunto.

The c.) option makes the noble a legal problem. Both kings now have claims
on his services. The natural cause for them is to try and win the noble
over to their side, and to mistrust him if they can't. In war, the noble
had better stay neutral lest he commit treason. (Witness Enguerrand de
Coucy who held lands in England and France at the same time, and stayed
neutral in the war).

The d.) option means you are in no-man's-land. Without fealty there is
no privilege. No office, no peerage. You don't belong anywhere.

So much for the middle ages. In SCA terms, implementing these possibilities
would be nice but impractical. On the theoretical side, it would result in
so many multiple "citizenships" that few people would know where anybody
belonged. It would get the kingdoms all mixed up. In a place like Drachen-
wald, where the people are drawn from all over the USA, I fear it would
mean chaos. (Witness the difficulties of the crusades, when knights from
all over Europe found themselves together in Palestine, but all served
different kings and took this as a licen not to serve or obey the local
authorities. Finally, a new kingdom had to be created to sort this out.)

It might be feasible to allow peers to swear fealty to any king they
choose. But it would not work with officers. Allowing double fealties
could be left up to the sovereign. As I said, I would like to agree, but
the whole idea smacks of something that could create an impossibly
tangled "legal" and feudal situation. Very period, but not good for the SCA
as a society.

Good gentles,

When you are trying to find a SCA group in an area and you are a member of the
SCA, please consult your Tournements Illuminated for the name of the kingdom
seneschal.  Call or write the seneschal and they will tell you about any group
you might be interested in.  They can give contact people, event info, anything
you want to know.

If you are not a member, please give as much info as possible about where you 
are.  Generic College is not readily found on a map.  City name or geographic
region is much more helpful.

By the way, Digestifier, perhaps you could include an address, such as the
Office of the Registrar so that people who come across the SCA on the computer
have some official resource to contact.  

I wonder, how many people's first encounter with the SCA is through SCA

While not directly applicable to the posting above ...

	Prior to a baronial arts and sciences competition, the various
powers that be kept exhorting us lowlifes to create and enter projects.
While all well and good in and of itself, there were also some people
bragging about their entries to the point that us lowlifes on highly
limited funds, barely experienced in the society, and not too talented
in such things besides, knew that we had absolutely no chance of winning.
To answer this crying need for appropriate competition, Slag von Zeig
and myself crafted "The Masterpiece." Bending a length of 9 ga galvinized
fence bracing wire into a 1" split ring was the easy part. For we then
had to carefully flatten the ends with erratic blows with a ball-pein
hammer. By this point, the ring was more than a bit eccentric, and we
distorted it further by overlapping the ends. With the utmost artistry
and a dull drill bit, we pierced the overlapping irregular lobes. After
repeated attempts at forming a rivet from 14 ga steel wire failed, we
put a length through the holes, and hammered the living bejabers out of
the whole assembly. This we dubbed "The Masterpiece" and adding a quickly
scrawled note reading: "They had rivited chain-mail in the Medieval Ages,
and this here is one." We then proceeded to show it to our friends, who
ooh-ed and aww-ed over it. We entered it in the arms and armor part of
the competition and pointed it out with great fanfare to acquaintences
from far and wide. Finally, we celebrated long and loud over our "narrow
loss" to a "fine, fine, project" at post-revel.

	The key was that we presented it in as serious of a manner as
the hucksters in "The Emperor's New Clothes" and it became a game for
all who became involved. Critical comments as, "What wonderful gouges!
Did you perchance use vice-grips?" basically made it a fun time for
us who couldn't do well in the "real" competition, and we too had
something to celebrate at post revel. As an aside, all the judges but
one recognized the nature of our entry and made humorous observations
about it. I entered a well-made, but uninspired coif. Slag had some
other "serious" project as well.


More to the point ...

	Perhaps the resources of the fisher-folk could help the poor
soul with a coif sans documentation? I displayed mine without such
paperwork a number of years ago when that was not particularly damning
for such things that were regaurded as being of "common knowlege," so
I'm afraid that I can't really help on that one.

There are recordings of period dance music.  The ones I have are

*Dances*, Calliope (Nonesuch CD 9 79039-2)
*Terpsichore: Renaissance and Early Baroque Dance Music*, Ulsamer Collegium
 (Archiv CD 415 294-2)

but the problem with such recordings is that they are designed for the
listener, not for the dancer.  The median length of the tracks on the Ulsamer
Collegium disk is around one minute, which is barely enough time to demon-
strate the steps, much less let people dance their fill.  If you use such
recordings as these, you may have to do some serious editing to get some
more iterations.

I would, if it please the people of the Rialto, like to echo the original
poster's request for recorded dance music, especially recordings with tracks
long enough to dance to.  (Yet another reason to support your local consort!)
Perhaps some group in the Known World has made such recordings?

Well, it doesn't help WRT to Playford, but The Carolingian Dance Tape has a
number of pieces from Arbeau (including a reasonably brisk version of
Bransle Official), as well as several of the more common Basse Dances
(including Lauro/Castille la Nouvelle, Venus/Reale, Verceppe, and Geloxia).
The tape is pretty ancient (1976), but I believe that copies can still
be obtained from Baron Patri. If there is interest, I'll ask him if I
can post his address here...

For Playford, there are some decent recordings out there. I have one
named "Country Capers" (as I recall), which has a number of useable pieces
from the first edition of The English Dancing Master.

While I'm on the subject --

This would be a *great* topic for short articles for The Letter of Dance.

Subject: Pennsic Campsite Allocation Policy

Here's what I've heard about this year's plans to allocate campsites at
Pennsic.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  What you are reading now is third-hand information
about a policy which is not yet official.  I would rate it as reasonably
reliable rumor.  I am posting what I've heard for your information, but
would strongly advise against people doing more than talking about it
until more official word is forthcoming.

1.  Pennsic officially begins August 12th.  On August 6th, everyone
currently camping at the Coopers' campground will be asked to move to
the battlefield.  In other words, NO BENEFIT will result from camping
there from the beginning of June, or even the beginning of August.

2.  A lottery will be held.  On August 6th and 7th anyone who wishes may
enter the lottery on behalf of a group.  First chosen from the lottery
gets first choice of campsite, second chosen gets second choice, etc. 
(A large map will be available to aid in this process.)  People are free
-- indeed encouraged -- to make private arrangements such as trading
sites, posting notices saying "please don't ask for this spot because
our group has been camping here for fifteen years", etc.  If they can.

3.  Only one person need show up for each group in the lottery.  (A
group may be any size, and is expected to take an appropriately sized
piece of land.)  That person will have to pay the $3/day or whatever
camping fee, but the rest of the group will not, till they show up.

4.  HOWEVER, there will be a *fee* of $5 per person for each group in
the lottery.  So if you're putting in for a twenty-person campsite you
must *pay* $100.  The money is not a deposit.  It is an extra charge for
the privilege of reserving a good site.  All money paid into the lottery
goes directly into the Building Fund.  (An extra $5/person isn't that
much, but it *should* discourage people from claiming too much land on
spec.)

5.  The tentative plan is for there to be a tiered lottery.  That is,
first there will be a lottery for large groups (tentatively defined as
over thirty people) and then another one for small groups.  The
reasoning is that there are a lot of good campsites which are
inappropriate for large groups, and that this will avoid problems of
small groups setting up in the middle of a large field and making it
unusable for a larger group.  (This part of the plan seems somewhat
abuse-prone to me.)

6.  On August 12th, the autocrat will come around to make sure that
nobody's taken too much land, and to ask those who have to pull back and
make room for latecomers.  To facilitate this, the number of tents which
will be at the campsite must already be on the ground at that time.  Not
necessarily set up, but there.  (This part of the plan seems impractical
to me.)

So there it is.  It's certainly a better plan than last year's.  It's a
composite of a number of the plans that were suggested in the wake of
last year's 'experience', and addresses some of the issues
intelligently.  My opinion is that whether it will work or not depends
on the degree to which the autocrat has the time, inclination and
ability to administer it fairly and creatively, and the degree to which
people do or do not try to exploit loopholes in the system.

Subject: Re: Dance Music Recordings

The Book of the Month Club (and associated book clubs) has a
two-cassette (or three-lp) set of rennaissance dance music, consisting
of forty minutes each of Arbeau, Playford and Praetorius.  A good deal
of the material in the first two is danceable, although you may have to
do some splicing to get reasonable lengths on some of the dances.  The
Arbeau section, in particular, contains *all* the dances whose music
appears in Orchesographie (in forty minutes).

Subject: Pennsic Archery War Points

Here's what I've heard concerning archery at the War this summer.  Don't
take it as gospel until you've heard it from the mouth of a horse of an
appropriate color.

There will be a clout shoot and a charging-man shoot, both slightly
different from those of previous years.  The clout shoot will be a
ten-yard diameter circle at a range of 100 yards.  (Slightly larger than
last year's, at a longer range.)  (For those who aren't familiar with
this shoot, the circle is a wall of hay bales about two feet high,
representing a castle wall.  One point is scored for every arrow shot
within this circle in thirty seconds.  I believe that arrows hitting the
front of the front hay bales or the tops of the back bales are deemed to
have bounced off while those hitting the back of back bales or the tops
of the front bales are deemed to have gone in, but I might have the tops
reversed.)

The charging-man shoot this year will include *six* targets, at 70, 60,
50, 40, 30 and 20 yards, each consisting of the silhouette of a man. 
(In previous years it's been a viking, and an arrow hitting anywhere but
the axe or the small shield has counted as a point.)  I'm told this will
also be a 30-second shoot.

I have personal doubts about the latter shoot.  For one thing, it seems
more practical to me, if there are six targets, to make it a six-arrow
shoot (one at each range) than a timed one.  For another, I'm not sure
how practical the setup will be in terms of everyone on the line being
able to get a reasonable shot at each target -- some of the angles will
be *real* strange.

Well, time to start practicing.  *We'll* practice, if it ever stops
raining :-)

Subject: A source for Celtic Sources

Greetings (Failte)!

A number of people have sent requests for my Celtic bibliography.  When I get
the thing together, should I post it to the Rialto for general consumption, or
should I limit circulation to the people who've sent me email to request it?

I thought I'd take the liberty of posting the source for some of my best
sources: Sam Wenger of Three Geese in Flight Books in Woodstock, NY.  He has
everything -- he even just sold a facsimile copy of the original Book of 
Taliesin!  Write to him or call him and request a catalog; the new one will be
out shortly.

Sam and I have been doing business for 6 or 7 years now, and he can find me
things that no one else has ever heard of.  He deals exclusively with the
Celtic/Arthurian realms (though he has a small sideline in the local history
of his part of New York).  Here is a minuscule sampling of the things he just
received on Celtic art:

Frank Delaney: The Celts (from the BBC series)
Celtic Art (the new book published by Thames and Hudson)
Irish Hands: Scribes and Irish Manuscripts
The Book of Kells (the paperback Thames and Hudson facsimile)
Celtic Art and Classical Mutations
Rediscovery of Ireland's Celtic Art Past (Celtic Revival; Yeats and friends)

Here's how to contact Sam:

He does mail order, and he pays the shipping if your order comes to more than
$100.  People in Coill Tuar or Frosted Hills might want to just drop in and
marvel -- he's right on the main street in Woodstock.

Enjoy.

In a recent posting, Dani gave some information about Pennsic land policy,
with the warning that it was third-hand and might be wrong. If it is more
than about a month old, it is wrong, since I spoke with the autocrat
(Baroness Clair) about that long ago, and at that time her plans were
entirely different from what was posted. Of course, they may have cha.L)Vxsince.

On the subject of the charging-man shoot, the original idea was to reproduce
what would really happen if archers were shooting at a line of charging
men--in which case you would have a given amount of time before they reached
you, not a given number of arrows. Before Pennsic 1, we actually timed a
fighter in armor running, in order to decide how much time you had at each
target. The timing and spacing have been changed since then, on the basis of
other considerations--I believe they "slowed down" the charging men because
people were having a hard time getting an arrow off in three seconds. So far
as I know, there have been no other problems with practicality--we have been
doing it this way at every Pennsic I can remember. Some positions in the line
are more favorable than others, but the difference is not that great.

Incidentally, while on the subject of Pennsic, I will be doing an in-persona
encampment, as usual. Anyone interested in participating, or with questions,
should get in touch. People who want to drop by during Pennsic are of course
welcome, provided they are willing to stay in persona while inside our

Greetings!
In reply to Luwent the Lewd's (sorry if i messed up the spelling, my
commodore demon box has awful resolution) comments, I think that we are
trying to create a persona of someone who Could Have Been lurking about
between 600 and 1600.  you're right, trying to recreate a -Real- person
would be difficult, if not downright impossible, besides the fact that
there are not enough real period people to go around.
I also would like to know about residence of various kingdoms, baronies,
etc., also being a student.  Right now I'm in the Barony of Andlecrag,
Middle Kingdom, but may end up in a different canton this summer, and
possibly in a whole other barony, depending upon how various possible
plans turn out.  Does one simply swithch Baronies with no fanfare?
Also, what does one do about attending meetings, etc, of a new canton?
Especially if the residents of the new canton may have heard some things
about me (in relation to an ex-boyfriend, nothing to do with SCA) from a
present member ( but I think he's better than that :) )?

I think the issue here is names, not personae.  The SCA
does not require a persona for participation.  All we want
is an *attempt* at garb. 

In particular, I think the issue here is REGISTRATION of names.  
In the SCA, you can call yourself whatever you want, as long
as it is not presumptuous or otherwise offensive, regardless of whether
it is authentic.  What I think the BoD is concerned with is whether
you can register (with the Heralds) a name that is made up, taken
from Tolkien, etc.

Since registration of a name is not required for participation,
it seems to me that this is not a barrier to new members.
And, of course, your local heralds should be there to help
you when you choose a name to register, so inability or unwillingness
to do research should not be a barrier to registering a name.
The name you register is that name by which you will be
called up into court, but need not have any relation to what
people call you, or to your persona-l fantasies, etc.

Some heralds, well, I anyway, find it puzzling that people should
want to register Elvish names, random names, and other stuff,
when so many beautiful and authentic names exist.

Fortunately, it does not happen often.  It is very serious, and, of course,
applies to the real-life person, not their persona, if any.
(We wouldn't want some crook who gets banished to come back under
a new SCA name.)

I think that as long as the name has the "proper period and cultural ambience"
it should be passed.  Requiring documentation for persona names, I feel, is
unnecessarily limiting, especially for newcomers to the society.  I had
a very difficult time trying to get my name passed (it took me eight years).
Also, the process of naming people is a very subjective thing.  Parents have
been known to make up names for their children simply because the combination 
of letters sounded good.  Why then, should we be restricted from using the
same process in choosing our names?  So long as people are not claiming to
actually be the fictitious character I do not see the harm in using the name.

Doesn't the fledgling kingdom require the consent of the parent kingdom to
become a full kingdom?  I cannot see allowing a section of a kingdom to become
a separate kingdom, if by that action the parent kingdom would lose its status
as a kingdom.

>Wanting to be considered a subject of a Kingdom other than that in which one

I feel that one should be allowed to be considered the subject of the kingdom
that one calls home.  For example, my knight, Atai Sir Yoshina, spent several
years in the Midrealm (at the request of the USAF) but always considered 
himself a subject of the East.  There are quite a few SCAdians whose jobs
require them to change addresses from time to time.  Are we to require that
these gentles change their fealty with their address? (no matter where I live,
I shall always remain an Easterner)

>Restriction on Sovereign and Consort from holding any other offices (except
>territorial Baronetcy) during their reign.
 
I cannot see that a reigning Soverign or Consort would have time to hold
another office. (and if they do they're doing something wrong!)

I think that I have said enough for now.

Eowyn Eilonwy of Alewife Brook gives greetings from Carolingia to all who
read these words, and especially to Ulfin of Wyrmgeard, who seeks advice
on weddings.

I have attended three SCA weddings that I can recall (as opposed to
modern-world weddings of friends in the SCA), and will try to recollect
their peculiarities for you.

The first occurred several years back (perhaps a decade by now -- one loses
track), between Lord Taran of Windy Hill and Lady Lark of Esherwood, both
of Carolingia (Boston area).  Their SCA wedding was held sometime after
their modern one, as part of a revel here, in a hall of no special
significance.  As I recall, both principals and their attendants were
attired in fancy new court garb, and somehow each was led forward to kneel
on pillows before the assembled crowd -- and, come to think of it, probably
before our Baron, since this may well have taken place as an adjunct to
Baronial Court.  While the bride and groom knelt, facing each other I
think, the heads of their respective households took turns offering
promissory blessings.  It went something like this: Baron Steffan ap
Cennydd, head of House Silverwing (to which Taran belonged) offered to set
up their first son to train to be a knight; then Baroness Kathryn Goodwyn,
head of House Goodwyn (to which Lark belonged), offered to set up their
first daughter with proper gentle training and a good marriage.  Then
Steffan tried to top that by offering something for their second son....
    By the time Steffan and Kathryn had reached about the fourth of each
type of offspring, Taran begged them to stop, pointing out that while
he welcomed the opportunity to inherit from his kin, he would prefer to
wait until they died before cleaning them out completely -- he's a herald,
so he put this more wittily than I can recall.
    Then Cardinal Lord Michael of Winterskeep (who holds no ecclesiastical
rank in the modern world, as far as I know), spoke a short time on standard
(dare I say canonical) wedding topics, and then I believe they gave each
other vows before the assembled company.  I apologize that I cannot recall
more, but it -was- quite some time ago.

The next was still some 4 or so years ago, the wedding of Lord Harold von
Auerbach and Anne (I've forgotten her full SCA name), both of Stonemarche
(NH -- well, technically at that time they were both from one of the shires
which preceded Stonemarche, because the NH shires combined to form that
barony only a year and a half ago).  Their wedding was held as part of an
All Saints' Day revel in that shire -- I believe some time after their
modern wedding.  This took place during the reign of Sebastian and
Sirillian, which will date it for anyone with a good memory, because the
King and Queen were there and he presided.
    The event was held in a small church, and most of the activity took
place in the hall under the sanctuary, but the wedding (and later, court)
occurred upstairs in the sanctuary.  For the wedding, we were all called to
come sit in the pews and bear witness.  Seats had been set up in front for
the participants, and the royalty were already there.  Harold and Anne, in
nice court garb I believe, came forward with a few attendants and asked the
King to recognize their marriage.  They presented a marriage contract
(presumably calligraphed by Harold, who's good at that sort of thing)
setting out the terms of the dowry and such, and swore that all the terms
which could be fulfilled before the ceremony (e.g. gifts of cattle) had
been.  Sebastian then spoke a few suitable words, explaining that a king
cannot cause or enforce a marriage, he can only recognize it, and I think
offering them non-sectarian good wishes.  I believe sometime in here Harold
and Anne spoke vows to each other.  Again, my memory of details fails due
to the passage of time.

Most recently, a royal wedding occurred in the East.  A year and a half
ago, when Gavin Kilkenny of Kilcarrin won the Crown for his (modern-world
wife of a few years) Sedalia MacNair, he swore at Crown Tourney that he
would marry that lady (SCA-wise) before taking the throne.  At their
Coronation, a year since, the wedding occurred.  As usual for the East, the
outgoing monarchs held court and gave out awards and such, and when they
asked if any further business existed, Gavin came forward (with an armed
honor guard) to claim the Crown.  The various appropriate folk swore
publicly that Gavin had won the previous Crown Tourney and was the Royal
Heir, and despite the outgoing King's recitation of the burdens of the
Crown, Gavin was still willing to become King -- indeed, he swore on the
Stone of Scone (or a reasonable papier-mache' facsimile thereof, carried
into court and deposited before the thrones for this purpose) that he
would.
    But Gavin's predecessor (one of the Morghuns?  I've lost track) noted
that an apparently unfulfilled condition of his accession was his vow to
marry Sedalia.  Gavin stated he was prepared to marry her then and there,
and Sedalia came forth attended by numerous ladies in waiting, so the King
directed them to wed immediately according to their "barbarous northern
customs".  What I recall of the wedding (I hadn't slept the night before,
so I was a bit woozy) was that Gavin and Sedalia both stood on the "stone",
and Earl Sebastian Nightwind (one of Sedalia's longest friends in the SCA)
came forward wearing a baldric of MacNair tartan and claimed to be the
representative of the MacNair of MacNair (Sedalia's presumed clan chief),
and to bring word from that worthy that this member of his clan was in fact
allowed to proceed with this wedding.  There was some mention of dowry, at
which point the ladies in waiting all displayed the lengths of fine cloth
and fancy trim they had been carrying.  Then Gavin and Sedalia spoke their
vows while still standing on the stone, and then they were crowned.  Soon
thereafter, the flunkies returned to remove the "stone" so the nobles
wishing to swear fealty to the Crown could do so unobstructed.

I regret that I cannot give you further details of these occurences;
mayhap someone else with better memory will be able to fill the gaps I
have left.  Good luck and best wishes to you and your lady wife..

Greetings my friends,
Two comments today:

1)Meeting at Pennsic is a good idea.From my experience last 
year let me sugjest that we meet a t some easily found spot ,such
as at Ekerhardt's cart  (on the field between the general store 
and the main merchant area, or some such place that does not require 
travelling clear accross camp to find.

2)As far  as meeting at Noreascon 3, - agood idea -put a notice in the
newsletter (this can be done at the information desk).I will
be hard to find since I'll be doing Hotel Liasion  this year but 
I'll be registered in the Sheraton under Janet C.Johnston.

To Cynthia from Isenfir, who wanted to know what to bring to Pennsic:

The best list I've ever found is the one in the Known World Handbook; Arastorm
the Golden wrote the article, and though I can't remember its title, I do
remember that "Waggonloading for the Compleat Idiot" is right next to it.  It's
worth the $$$ to get the Handbook from the Stock Clerk, or send me private
email and I'll send you an extensive list of the goodies I bring.

The basics are these: 3 or 4 warm-weather outfits, something for cool weather,
something waterproof, a tent, a sleeping bag, lots of money (especially if you
plan to eat at the Inn rather than cook your own), a box of garbage bags, your
feast gear, and a large water container.  Are you camping with a household or
a territorial group?  Do you have access to any communal supplies?  We can
talk about this offline and save everyone the disk space, unless there is
sufficient interest to make this public.

To Robyyan Torr D'Elandris and everyone else who's been thinking about meeting
at Pennsic:

I too would love to meet the faces behind the messages; I know most of the
East Kingdom posters, but would love to see the rest of you too!  Please don't
open another can of worms on my account, but was it really decided once and
for all that we "netters" would hang fishnet around the camp so that we might
be recognized?  (I wander a lot; it would be a sad thing if one of you came
to visit me, saw the net, and I was out looking for you!)

Thursday night is traditionally the Archers' Social and Friday night is usually
Clann Party time, but I'll happily come to a gathering at any other time.
Those are just my suggestions; if the Rialto gathering happened on one of 
those nights I'd try to come anyway.  (I might have to "do" someone's SCAdian
wedding on Friday, too.  Please try to avoid Friday night if at all possible.)
What do the rest of you think?  It really isn't too early to plan; everyone
else who has stuff to do is already talking about it!

To Padraig Cosfada o Ulster: Paisano!  Glad to hear from you!

I actually had sources -- none of them in the fiction bins -- for what we
found on Celtic weddings.  I have to get the bibliography from Seosamh since
he has all the books, but I'll email the list to you as soon as I'm able.

We didn't find anything on Druidic ritual per se; our ceremony itself was a
construction based loosely on what we know from the symbolism and even more
loosely on modern ritual.  We actually announced the nature of the ceremony to
our guests, in order not to offend on either a religious basis or on the basis
of authenticity -- we wanted to construct a ceremony that might have been.  I
will include what we found, and where.

We did find a lot about Brehon laws on marriage; they came from a couple of
excellent sources (albeit 19th-century ones).  Because of the oral nature of
ancient Irish record-keeping and the number and savagery of the English laws
and actions against Irish ways, a frightening percentage of the knowledge is
lost.  There are few -- if any-- primary sources from ancient Ireland, though
we have some from people who had been to Ireland and wrote about it.

This posting is long enough.  Talk back to me!  I'd like to hear from other
Celts who've engaged in research.

Greetings, good gentles.

As was previously announced in the Rialto, Caid is hosting this years
Known World Heraldic Symposium, which is being held in conjunction
with a scribal symposium.  Details have appeared in all kingdom
newsletters.  The event will present classes in both areas, and will
publish proceedings in both areas. 

I have spoken with the gentles running the event, and they are short
of both classes and articles for the proceedings.  Anyone interested
in either teaching a class at the Symposium, or in writing an article
for its proceedings, please contact me for details.  They are
particularly short of material for the scribe's proceedings.

Thank you.

Subject: Lady Niccola's challenge

I'm sorry I won't be in the East to see this year's Ice Dragon Pentathalon.
Here are some tips on how to Lady Niccola.

First decide whether you want to beat Lady Niccola in one category, or overall.
It is easier to beat her at one thing (she, after all, has been working on
several projects, so can't spend as much time on any single project), but it
would be more satisfying to beat her overall.  The easiest category to beat 
someone is "miscellaneous"--research an area no one has been working in, and
add a new facet to SCA re-creation.  Of course, the judges will probably know
nothing about the field, so you'll have to back up the 3"x5" card with lots
of documentation.

If you decide to go for broke and try for an overall victory, you will probably
need more than the minimum five categories.  Have a couple of extra entries,
to protect yourself against a really superb entry from someone who is only
entering one contest.  I'm sure Lady Niccola is preparing more than five
entries.  Some of your entries will probably have to be in a field in which
you are not already expert, which means you'll have to do extra research 
and make some practice pieces.  One of the great things about the Ice Dragon
arts competition is the way is induces people to try things they wouldn't
otherwise have done.  Many Myrkfaelinnites have acquired new skills and hobbies
preparing for Ice Dragon.

Use good materials.  If you are poor, choose projects that can be made out of 
wood, steel, or other fairly inexpensive materials.  Don't try to fake 
gold, silver, and other expensive materials--the results come out looking like
stage props.  The biggest problems with materials are often in the garb
competitions, in which flashy outfits are sometimes made out of low-quality
synthetics.  You're better off with a well-researched, well-constructed garment
(perhaps from an earlier period or a lower social class) made out of sturdy
cotton or wool.  The judges do notice details like hand stitching, so try
not to take too many short cuts.

It helps a lot to meet regularly with other artisans.  One reason that the
Myrkies take more than their share of Ice Dragon prizes is that they regularly
get together, both in the official arts meetings and in Mac's shop.
When several people are working on similar projects, they swap tips about
how they managed to solve technical problems.  The extra enthusiasm often
gets people past the depression of a botched attempt or an apparently endless
project.

I hope that these hints help someone (other than Lady Niccola) win.
I'm only sorry I won't be there to see the competition--it sounds like it'll be
the best year yet.

(In case you're wondering about my credentials in offering this advice,
I did win an Ice Dragon Pentathalon once, thanks mainly to the urging of Lady
Niccola, and the support that Myrkfaellin gives to fledgling artisans.)

Subject:  Regarding the new _Corpora_

Greetings!

Several times in the recent past, I have mentioned plans to excerpt my
letter of comment to the Board on the draft of the new _Corpora_.  As I have
already stated, each and every individual associated with the SCA will be
directly affected by this document for years to come.  I feel very strongly
that it t behooves us all to discuss the new _Corpora_ here and, more
importantly, to write the Board.

It was brought to my attention not very long ago that the letters of comment
received by the Board were surprisingly few.  This saddens me, because the
Board specifically requested input from the Populace on a number of important
points.

So many SCA'ers bitch about how the Board often fails to solicit our opinions.
Well, this time the Board has done so.  So, I don't think we should pass up
the opportunity!  They *are* listening.

So, after considerable thought, I have decided that it ain't worth my time to
excerpt my letter of comment, unless sufficient interest in a discussion
exists.

In an attempt to determine whether anyone's interested in discussing the new
_Corpora_, I am listing below those topics which the Board specifically asked
for input on.  If anyone on the Rialto wishes to discuss any or all the topics
listed, please indicate so somehow (including by writing directly to me).

If it appears that we can get a viable discussion going, I shall type up the
relevant clauses from the draft in their entirety and post them (NOTE:
information regarding these same issues has appeared in recent _TI's_).  These
can then be seen by all, and discussed accordingly.  It would be at that time
that I would add my own commentary.

However, it should be noted that whatever discussion takes place here won't be
as important as, nor heeded as well as, writing directly to the Board.  It
seems to me that anyone who takes the time to work up a posting should be able
to print it out.  If one were unable to put the printout in letter form, one
could always write a quick cover note and attach the printout of one's
comments to it.  The important thing is not to pass up this all-too-rare
opportunity to have a direct effect on the course of the Society in the near
future.

Do think about it, please!

       TOPICS THE BOARD HAS REQUESTED POPULAR INPUT REGARDING:

"Non-period," invented names (i.e., names which are derived from literature or
invented, and which, while not actually authentic, maintain a proper period

parent Kingdom to fall below minimum.

Banishment (the Steward is especially interested in input on this topic);
under what conditions it should be implemented, and how.

Wanting to be considered a subject of a Kingdom other than that in which one
resides, and the effects of same.

Restriction on Sovereign and Consort from holding any other offices (except
territorial Baronetcy) during their reign.

A number of other new restrictions, of differing types, on Crowns/Coronets.

Some aspects of requirements for elevation to the Peerage.

Some aspects of awards/orders, especially as regards Provinces.

Subject:  Lots of little comments (2nd attempt at mailing)

I MAILED THIS A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO, AND IT SEEMS TO HAVE BLACK-HOLED.  IF THIS
POSTING APPEARS A SECOND TIME, PRAY FORGIVE ME!  --CHER

Greetings!

Lots of little comments, this time around...

LONGSHIPS:  Large-scale model longships have been built and burned several
times in Trimaris, usually for a simulated Norse funeral.  Most notable
amongst these was the longship burned at the end of the first reign on Duke
Baldar Longstriter.

MUSEUM REPLICAS, LTD.:  Being in the South, their stuff is readily available,
and I see it all the time.  For the most part, their blades are very good.  I
regard Museum Replicas as the most reasonable alternative for large blades,
for SCA'ers.

WEDDINGS:  I wholeheartedly agree with everything that's been said about
imagination and planning beforehand.  In my experience, SCA weddings can be a
lot of fun.  In the instances where the SCA wedding and the mundane wedding
were coincidental,  potential tensions between the SCA and mundane guests were
eased by the bride and groom simply making sure that there were a few people
whose sole task was the performance of introductions.  It got everyone talking
to each other, which really helped.  A good example (and a quick anecdote as
well) is provided by describing some of the arrangements for the wedding of
Lady Caitlinn Emrys and Sir Eric von Rabenscold, now Baron and Baroness
Wyvernwoode.

The wedding was essentially Cavalier, and was held at an event.  It was the
mundane as well as the SCA wedding.  As I remember it, those gentles who
comprised the formal escort during the ceremony (including providing the arch
of swords for the recessional) acted as ushers.  They introduced the bride and
groom's parents and other assorted relations around, and seated everyone.  The
mundane guests were seated together, which made it easier on their nerves.
:-)  The only hitch I ever heard about concerned Lady Caitlin's father, when
he was being seated (and who told me this himself after the ceremony).  He was
escorted by Elina Thrymsfostra (surname/sp?), who was dressed in male garb
(including rapier), and who was part of the formal escort.  Cat's father
looked down to see that Elina's arm was bent, which deepened somewhat his
already-existing quandry as to whether to take Elina as a male or female in
this instance (since he fully understood what was going on):  was she offering
him her arm? Was *"he"* offering "his" arm?  What was the correct course of
action?  How to proceed?

Then Cat's father realized that Elina was simply resting her wrist on the
pommel of her rapier, and *that's* why her arm was bent...

One other note, prompted by Awilda Halfdane's remarks in Dig. #317:  I have
read (although I freely admit that I forget where) in early America that
affianced couples were allowed to keep warm by cuddling together in bed.  This
was done with the parents' knowledge, and was supposedly a fairly common
custom.  No doubt little imagination is needed to figure out what some of the
results of this custom were...

YANG THE NAUSEATING:  Will always be remembered for his famous exchange of
remarks with one Crown:

                 Crown:  "You speak *treason*, sir!"

                 Yang:  "*Fluently!*"

BAWDY STUFF/CARIADOC'S POSER:  First, my compliments to Li Kung Lo for his
recent remarks.

All SCA performers have a number of things to consider when choosing a piece,
and all performers should try to maintain a sense of appropriateness with
respect to time and situation when making their choices.  I think this is
fairly clear, and that everyone recognizes it.

There are two aspect, however, which are in my opinion often overlooked:
degree of comprehension; and "environmental programming."  By the former, I am
referring to the fact that, since the gentles sitting out there listening
represent interests in many different cultures, many will be unfamiliar with
any given culture's style of presentation.  As an extreme example, lots of
European types would be bored silly by a samisen player, no matter how fine
the performance.  Lack of familiarity in various and sundry forms (not knowing
the language, for instance) makes comprehension, and therefore appreciation,
difficult.  I wish it noted, however, that I also think that exposure to new
and different things does one good, so I personally try not to be pay
attention (assuming that I can hear and that my meal isn't interrupted for too
long... :-) ).

By the latter, I meant two things:  1) like it or not, we do not completely
park our 20th Century sensibilities at the door when we attend an event-- they
are ingrained in each of us at a sub-conscious level; 2) what was appropriate
in the context of one culture might not have been appropriate in the context
of another, even if they were contemporary.  This is the bind I think Duke
Cariadoc gets caught in.  There have already been several excellent
suggestions made for working around this situation.  To them I would add
another:  if one wishes to remain completely in persona (a la' Cariadoc's
description) have oneself introduced to the audience by another party.  The
party performing the introduction could, for instance, introduce Cariadoc
as an Islamic story-teller, working in a few brief comments explaining the
attitudes the audience is about to encounter.  A warning about the
explicitness of the material (or whatever) could also be worked in.  It could
be *great* schtik, serious or funny!

MEAD/TANNIN:  Apart from tea and North Florida ground water, the three best
sources of tannin I know are:  acorns, acorns, and acorns.  However, acorns
are *much* more potent than tea as far as tannin goes.

You might want to try this:  gather *lots* of acorns.  Remove the caps, put
them in a big pot of cold water, and boil.  The water will turn brown,
indicating the leaching of the tannin in the acorns.  You can use some of this
water in your mead (or whatever).  Change the water; boil again.  Do this
until the water no longer turns brown.  Dry the acorns; toast if need be by
spreading on a cookie sheet in roasting at 400-425 degress for about 15 min or
so.  Grind acorns into flour, combine with unbleached white flour, and make
into bread.  You will have a very period peasant's bread, as well as all the
tannin you could want.

SIR KENELME DIGBY:   I am *sick and tired* of not owning a copy of Digby!!
Can anyone suggest where I can get one?  There are excellent bookstores
locally, so if someone can name a good source, I should be able to order one
no problem.  Thank you!

I agree with Arval that Friday night would be a good time to meet
at Pennsic.  I would also suggest, since there is only so much time
and so many parties, that we limit our party time - say to a
"cocktail hour" or something like it.  That way we can get together
for a little while, meet in person, and then go back to long-winded
discussion when we get home and logged in :-)

Since many schools are letting out sometime soon, and many of our
students will be out of touch for the summer, I think it would be
a good idea to settle on something soon before they're all gone.
It may be imposing, Arval, but could we maybe say that Herald's

meet there?

Subject: Early Period (a publication)
Message-Id: <May.2.17.24.59.1989.16665@elbereth.rutgers.edu>

A while back, Lord Kwellend-Njal posted information about a
publication called Early Period.  I followed up on his info with a
letter to the publishers, and found out that the magazine still
exists, only the address had changed.  I subscribed and ordered the
sets of back issues and I must say, I'm very impressed!  

Basically, the articles deal with pre-1066 topics of interest to
persons with early period personae in the SCA or similar organizations
(quote from the cover).  All articles are published with sources
(Yay!), and the topics range from Viking Musical Instruments to 
Adapting Early Style Helms for SCA Fighting to Roman Women's
Hairstyles to Early Period Tents to Pronouncing Welsh to ... you get 
the idea.  I got those titles just by flipping through issues at
random; there's lots more.  Also included are recipes for feasts,
patterns for shoes and embroidery, etc.  This looks like a must for
anyone interested in early period personae and provides something hard
to find for early period, documentation!  

Subscriptions are $10.00 per year (comes out quarterly), and each of
the two sets of back issues is also $10.00 (there are 10 back issues).
Ten bucks may seem steep for a quarterly, but each issue is about 30 
pages long.  It is available from:
		David & Rebecca Wendelken
		P.O. Box 631
		Rome GA 30161

I was told that the next issue is at the printers now, so I'll be 
looking for it and will post a review when it comes.  

Disclaimer: I have no connection with this publication other than
being glad I discovered it (Thanks, Kwellend!).

	Well, if I want to join the SCA (and I do), and I am told that
in order to have a persona, I am going to have to do a bit of
research, possibly in an area that the local library is not going to
have *any* information on, then I am going to be that much less likely
to attempt to enter into the group, so as a weeding out tool, this
could be affective.  However, if one feels that one has a unique
personanlity, and one has tried to find someone that they can relate
to/play the part of, but has been unsuccesful, then what are you
supposed to do?
	The way I understand it (and correct me if I am wrong), it is
not required that you take up the role of some person that actually
existed, but merely someone that could have existed, given the times
in which you decide to "be" from.  If I have to go and find this
person that has all my traits, and that I think I can dso a good job
of "being", then I am going to be sitting in the library for a good
long time.  Also, how precise does this have to be?  Are we going to
recreate these peoples wardrobes?  Their armour?  Their squires,
ladies, lords, and whatever?  Suddenly, it becomes more of a staged
play, than a free-form group of people, all trying to be someone that
they have always wanted to be.
	What it all comes down to is the fact that this means a lot
more work on the beginning SCAer, on top of the tough descision of
what areas they want to participate, howe involved they are going to
get, etc.

>Banishment (the Steward is especially interested in input on this topic);
>under what conditions it should be implemented, and how.

	Fisrt I've heard on this topic, can someone clue me in???  Are
you as a person, or you as a persona, banished?

>Wanting to be considered a subject of a Kingdom other than that in which one
>resides, and the effects of same.

	This affects me directly,as a college student, home and home
(one school, the other parental) are about eight hours drive away,
which is quite a few baronies, to say the least.  I have friends who
live on one coast, and go to school on the other.  Does this mean that
for nine months, I am going to be a subject of one kingdom, then find
a way to get either expelled, or other methods of being able to
participate in another kingdoms events, for the time that I am there.
	Also, if there are two places that I am living, which
Kingdom or Barony do I chose to be mine, and which do I belong to?

	Just assorted thoughts on assorted topic...

Let me first state that I am not Daryl (or Isamu Torinaga), I am his lady love,
his reason for living, the cherry on his proverbial sundae, but I digress.
The reason I have invaded your network is to pick the multitude of brains 
accessing this network and gather information concerning the moors.

The Moors as a people interest me but the timespan (600-1600 A.D.) is a little
daunting for one poor researcher to tackle without a specific area (or time 
period) to focus upon. I consider myself somewhat of a freethinking neofeminist
individual so I already realize that my persona may have to be a widow or an 
outcast. Stuff happens.

Are people interested in having a party for the Rialto at Noreascon? I'd
love to meet some of you (it just never seemed to work out last Pennsic).
Write to me if you're planning on being there and are interested in a

I was going to answer this by email, since I wasn't sure quite what was
being asked, but my response bounced, so I'll just post it.:


Before moving on to the heart of your question, I'd like to comment on
the first
part by noting that a) It is better to sing.  b) There is a surprising
amount of
good period material.  c) A good compromise for a folk singer is to pull
out
material from the seventeenth and early-eighteenth centuries, as most of
the
audience will think them period and the ones who know better will
probably not
find them jarring.

As to sources for songs, I'm not quite sure what it is you are looking
for. 
Period ballads?  Songs with the right feel to them?  Simple melodies or
complete arrangements?  I am particularly interested in the traditional 
Child ballads, myself, so I'll give some comments about those.  The
definitive source for traditional melodies is Bertrand Bronson's "The
Singing
Tradition of Child's Popular Ballads" (1959-1972), which many good
libraries
will have.  Not too many of the tunes are period, but he identifies
those that
are.  And, as I suggested, slightly out of period is only slightly bad
:-).
There are a good many traditional ballads (See Francis James Child's "The
English and Scottish Popular Ballads") which do not come with tunes, but
you can
follow the period custom of stealing contemporary tunes (See Claude
Simpson's
"The British Broadside Ballad and Its Music") that seem to fit.  Note
that what
you'll generally find is a fairly unadorned melody line.  A warning
about the
traditional ballads:  The ones "everyone knows" are almost invariably
nineteenth
or late-eighteenth century.

I can give more specific comments if this is the sort of thing you were
asking
about.  If I've missed my mark, please give me some examples of what
you're
looking for.

Good lords and ladies;

I think that a Pennsic Rialto party is an excellent idea.  The big
problems are when & where.  I would recommend Friday evening as a good
time.  It won't conflict with the major activities of the war
(battles, Great Court, etc.), and we aren't going to find an evening
at Pennsic when there isn't SOMETHING going on.  As to where, that's a
trickier question.  It would be good to have it someplace central &
easily recognizable, like herald's point (this is a possibility, but I
can't promise just yet) or one of the inns.

Message-Id: <2946@lindy.Stanford.EDU>

Vnend's method of training a new fighter is almost the opposite of
what I am used to.  Normally "we" (whoever that is) get a new
fighter used to weapons/shields long before they ever get into
armor.

The Bay Area (Pric. of the Mists) has two (or more) "slow work"
classes, where new fighters are taught the basics of stance,
movement, throwing shots, blocking, etc.  All this before they get
into armor.  Basically, the idea is to teach them the basics while
they are "getting their armor together".  Hopefully, they will be
less confused when they do get into armor.

Also, a lot of people drop out before they ever get into armor.
This keeps them from needing to get armor together, and saves the
trainers from having to train them in armor.

It sounds like Vnend's method work fine.  But it may not work as
well with groups of people, or when there is a high drop out rate.

The following is another posting from Niccola.  As you can see, she's clearly
getting out of hand.  She's got a big posterboard with boxes representing
projects.  She's pasted gold stars next to her entries.  She's got a tiny
little purse with about a zillion little stitches in it.  She comes to our
"arts" meeting every week and gloats over her coming victory.  'Cmon folks,
if she doesn't get some good competition, we're going to have to widen our
doorways in Myrkfaelinn so her head will get through!

We're doing the best we can.  Robert of Ferness made a respectable coif,
but Niccola pressed him about documentation, and he had to blushingly admit
that he was hoping to get it from her husband.  She scoffed at his approach,
and waved her posting about documentation at him.  She made everyone read it.

Everyone in Myrkfaelinn is planning projects to try and humble this
mad-woman.  She's tracking our projects on her posterboard.  I think it's
just to make sure no one gets ahead of her.

Please, somebody make something really neat, and brag about it on the net.
We need get her under control!  - Orlando

To everyone who sent to tell me they would come to Ice Dragon and give me
a run for my money: thank you. It will be a pleasure to meet you and beat
you. I hope you get your friends to join you. I would be very sad not to
have to kick a lot of butt to win.

Thought you'ld like to know something about my entries, so you can plan
your strategy. I am certainly going to enter a piece in knitting- a
reliquary bag like the ones in Sitten and Chur (Switzerland). The real
ones are stranded color work in silk at 18 stitches to the inch and come
from the 14th century. I have just done a test piece of a small
drawstring bag, but got only about 16 stitches to the inch and plan to do
a second test with the next smaller needle size.

Aside from any prizes offered for knitting by the Hael, I will personally
make a gift to the person who presents the highest scoring piece of
knitting if it is not myself. If you would like this prize, I seriously
advise you to go to the library and take out Richard Rutt"s *A History of
Handknitting*, Interweave Press (I think). It's full of great stuff and
you're going to need it if you're going to have half a chance.

My Lord Cariadoc,

The way to survive as an entertainer basically means knowing your audience and
presenting a good mix of materials.  If children or other people of delicate
sensibility are present, drop out the more explicit material.  If you've got a
party of rip roaring drunks, the sentimental songs of love are unlikely to go
over well. An it's perfectly all right to make comments that are in persona
even if they are chauvinistic, as long as they are performed in such a way that
people realize it is the persona speaking, and they are not being insulted.  In
this way you can include tales that you don't approve of, for whatever reason,
but can present a variety of pieces suitable for a variety of tastes.

 Basically, remember that entertainment is like a dinner:  If every course 
included cinnamon, everyone would soon be tired of cinnamon, no matter how 
well they liked the spice.  Vary your material.  Tell a  mixture of tales,
with a little explanation to warn the audience of what's coming up.  "Next I'd
like to tell of lovestory that I have often heard your Frankish troubadors
perform,"  and "This is tale popular with some of the more wicked of my people,
perhaps you will find it amusing."  Such lines  let you, in persona, educate
people as well as entertain them. By such devices you can tell them when and
where a song was performed, and whether it's period or not.  Patter of this kind
provides a graceful link between pieces, and whether the audience realizes it
or not, they're learning something.

And by the way, I did not say the Horde was the first non-europeans, obviously
there were a few scattered about before then.  Only that the Dark Horde opened
the way for them.  It was after the Horde formed that SCA experienced a large
increase in non-Europeans, and people accepted the idea that non-europeans had
a place in the SCA. And the Horde does maintain it's patronage of belly dance,
the Horde dancers winning awards for their skills.  I will confess that I have
heard the Horde's version of the origin of belly dancing, but as it gyved with
what I remember  at one of my very first events, I accept it as basically
true, if biased account.

Yes, this all happened a long time ago, and everybody has thankfully mellowed
out a lot since then, and maybe it was really never more than a tempest in a
tea cup, but for the people immediately involved it certainly seemed important.

Message-ID:  <8904291738.aa20587@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

Some gentles have written to suggest that if pearls were so popular in the
Middle Ages, they couldn't have been very valuable.  I would like to refute
that by calling their attention to the modern jewelry market.  

Today, diamonds are the most valuable gems, and diamonds are what the jewelry
stores sell, surpassing all other gems.  Human nature is not much changed, I'm
sure the kind of motivations that compell people to buy diamonds today
compelled people to buy pearls yesterday.

And pearls did have more uses that just their ornamental value,  I have seen
various recipes ascribing various magical properties to pearls.  Even today a
substance called "pearl creme" is being marketed on television as a way for
women to appear younger.  

Let me relate a few of the tales about pearls.  I have no idea how old some of
these ideas are, or how current they might have been in our period, but they
give you an idea of the mystique of the pearl.

Pearls maintian youth and beauty.  Cleopatra was supposed to have bathed in a
concoction made of ground pearls and mother's milk.

Pearls dropped in wine will disolve, and the resulting beverage can be drunk to
restore youth, vigor, and virility to men.

Pearls will nullify poison.  A pearl dropped in a glass of poisoned wine will
disolve, deactivating the poison.  

Pearls worn on the person will guard against disease and disaster, especially
water disasters.  

Pearls, if eaten whole, will make the eater wise.

Pearls, eaten whole, will prevent illness.

Pearls, worn on the person, gradually  change color to reveal the nature of the
wearer.  Pearls worn by pure persons will maintain their luster, pearls worn by
imperfect people will yellow and dull.

Some of these superstitions have basis in reality.  I have never tried it, but
from what I have read, vinegar is a strong enough acid to dissolve pearls.  And
pearls do maintain their luster better when worn regularly-the human skin
provides oil that maintains their moisture content.  On the other hand, I have
a necklace made of mother of pearl that has not yellowed noticeably in the years
I've had it, so maybe not.

)                                      Nicolette Bonhomme

	I've fought in a few units, ranging from a two-man team to a unit
about thirty strong.  Only one of them, a five man team at the "Flail for
Ail" in the Steppes back in A.S. (doing conversion in my head) 18, had even
*fought* together before.  The larger units, at the last two Pennsics, were
units that came together there (though most of us joined earlier) and were
still effective (surprisingly so.)  

	A part of the problem has already been addressed, it is often
difficult to find a time when everyone *can* meet, even when they are
geographically close enough for this to be practical.  The Steppes was
a large Barony with plenty of people, but not that many fighters (though,
myself excluded, we more than made up for lack of numbers with quality!)
Other than there I have been in places where there really weren't enough 
us, (or anyone willing to organize...) to form a unit.  Dragon'smark 
had, throughout most of my time there, about 5 authorized fighters,
three of whom were Dark Horde, and going to fight with the Horde in
battle (not that the Horde doesn't accept help on occation, I've fought
with them and had a lot of fun.)  Here I find myself in the hinterlands of 
one Barony and with most of my friends in another, but basically, once again
not in a good situation to practice group tactics.  So I've always been
in the possition of finding a unit to attach myself to a the last minute.
(This isn't usually a problem, as people are almost always willing to 
accept another shieldman, and for some perverse reason I *enjoy* fighting
in a shield wall...)

	There *are* units in the area.  The Wetlands Alliance (I know 
Settmore Swamp and Carillion are in it, I think Rusted Woodlands and
Bhakail are as well) should be able to field a large force, and, from
the pictures I've seen, do field a reasonable one.  They could field
a *huge* (for our purposes) force, but various households, rather than
fighting with their Baron, prefur to fight as a separate unit.

	There are also units that seems to fight together well enough that 
they must be practicing together.  Calantir seems to get some practice
before the war, and the Barony of Septemptria (in Ealdamere, in the Midrealm)
look like they get some practice in.  And various households also seem to
practice some group tactics.

	I don't know that we are *that* off from period practice.  While
it sometimes looks (especially in modern battle diagrams) like there were
large units in the field in period battles, mostly these were constructed
much as ours are, from several small bands.  If I remember correctly,
one of the more potent units on the field at Hastings was the professional
core of Harald's army, numbering a whole (correct me if I'm wrong) 200 men.
The rest were were the southern fird, raised only in the last few weeks
to combat the incoming armies.  And maintaining this large a permanent
fighting force was unusual in period, normally the king would only
have his personal household.  This changed as time went on, but seems 
to be the pattern throughout our period.  Most of an army was individuals
fulfulling feudal duties, some with a small retinue.  The more powerful
the vassal, the larger the retinue.  To a certain extent, we are very
accurate in part of our recreation. :-)

	As for what it is like...  Perhaps another posting, this one has
gotten a bit long...

Truly a poser, milord Cariadoc.  On the one hand, if you were to
be strictly in persona, I think you would be more than "intolerant"
of alternate relgions, although I may be wrong in that.  I do know,
though, that the various religions would not give rise to any sort
of harmony, and thereby they would provide ample opportunity for feuds,
duels, and such.

Thus, we have a good example of the clash between authenticity and "fun".
It would not be "fun" to argue with all and sundry not professing one's
religious beliefs, and would probably wear on those gentles upon whom
such argument is inflicted.

My personal view is that, in the interests of providing an enjoyable
time for all, one should not press one's beliefs too strongly.  This seems
a ripe situation for "live and let live", for the problem is actually
untenable in any other manner, I belief, 'cept one - murder all whom is
not of your belief.  Since they are "dead", it is obvious that if you
encounter them afterward they are merely spirits and therefore not worth
spending one's time striving against.

Last year, shortly before Pennsic, someone posted a 'what to take

and would like to start preparing now (lots of garb to sew!) Could that
person, or anybody else who wants to volunteer, post suggestions?
  
Also, could whoever posted the mead recipe repost it? For some reason
large chunks of alt.sca never make it to Virginia, and this recipe is

Greetings from Hal Ravn:

This is a procedural note.

The site I see alt.sca on doesn't really carry "alt" groups, but I
have a special arrangement and I get the postings as mail.  To post,
I have arranged with a friend--Harry Henderson, an "inactive" member
of the Society--to post things I mail to him.  That's why these postings
have TWO signature blocks at the bottom.

If you reply to Harry, he will forward the message to me.  But the
courteous thing to do--this is from the standpoint of bother to him--
is to send mail directly.  My e-mail address is in the first .sig set
below.  If you need a full path, take the one at the top of the posting
and add "pacbell" after "well"--our two machines talk to each other.

Subject: the pearl/diamond controversy

The discussion between Awilda and Cariadoc is getting a little acerbic.
I hope this doesn't escalate.

I have read some comments here that argue for pearls being of high value
based on their popularity - this doesn't seem quite right to me.  If a
stone is widely used, as pearls seem to have been, it is not likely the
most valuable stone available.  

One argu
ment for the value of pearls is that people died getting them - diving
holding one's breath is hazardous.  Pearls have been around a long time -
a pearl of great price, and all that.  As another has already pointed out,
they are immediately attractive - no faceting required (polishing??  I don't
know how pearls are processed).  Diamonds are just grey pebbles.

Along those lines I have a question - how were diamonds used, and what did
they look like before faceting?  When did faceting begin?  Cariadoc?  Anyone?

Subject: Crashing at people's houses and SCA weddings

In one of the recent Digests, Nicolette Bonhomme asked about the etiquette of
crashing at people's houses.

When people crash at my house after an event, I'm usually far too trashed from
working at the event to be much in the way of company.  This is a shame, as I
live alone and love to entertain.  The people who've made the Guest Hall of
Fame after staying at my house include:

everyone who brought his/her own towel

the person who brought the raspberry coffee

the couple who bring bagels, cream cheese, and honey butter everywhere they go

all the sweethearts who washed mountains of coffee cups and helped put out the
trash after the initial crowd was gone

The people who helped make a big breakfast for the crowd

the people who stayed behind to socialize after the work was done

If any of you recognize yourselves in that list, thank you!  I hope you'll
stay with me again next time, and that you'll make yourselves at home.

On SCA weddings: I think they go off best when they're constructed with one
period in mind.  My SCAdian husband and I (who are friends mundanely) are both
9th-century Celts, so it was relatively easy for us to research wedding customs
in Ireland, and make the rest up as we went along.  (We discovered that the
early Irish recognized many different types of marriages, but that's the topic
for a lengthier posting.)

We were married at Pennsic XIV, at sunset.  Since we lived in different camps,
his procession travelled halfway across the site to meet mine.  Other friends
of ours joined the processions as they went along, until we had a veritable
parade once the two groups came together (including Ariel the greyhound, two
ferrets, and a cow and pig we had "raided" from the nice man living next to
Horde Camp).  The entire wedding army proceeded back to Clann O Choda camp,
where we were married by one of the Druids of our Clann.  We drank from the
chalice, bound the cord, declared ourselves to be married, and the celebration
began!

We put on a small, informal feast: roast meat, beer, and assorted other 
goodies (thankfully, someone else in our household took care of all that).  All
our friends came to perform for us -- we had singing, dancing, stories, and
merrymaking late into the night.  We received lots of beautiful gifts, and we
gave small tokens to everyone who came.

It was a wonderful time and a truly great experience (someday I hope to have a
mundane wedding that's half as much fun as that was!), but an incredible
amount of work.

Milord Ulfin: If you're interested in more information, please email me
privately.  I could ramble on and on, and I suspect you're interested in some
of the details of how we managed to pull off this little drama.  The two
major factors in its success were: a devoted and hard-working household, and
LOTS of advance planning.

Thanks to everyone who responded when I mentioned that a second persona just
didn't work for me.  It has nothing to do with my appearance, the quality of
my research, or any of that: but I'm a Celt and will always be one.  I like
the fancy clothes, but I don't wear the attitude well.  Slainte!

a longship, based mostly on the findings of an arch. expedition in 
Orkney, but haven't had the time to do more than very general research
into what materials would be best for the model etc., but it is 
something that will get done One of These Days.

	Can someone out in Ansteorra ask around about the progress of that
project?

	Well, to a certain extent I disagree.  While filling the

in the finer points of a High Guard, a general discussion of training

information via mail if it becomes appropriate.  But for getting

	All of the things that we discuss are generally of interest to
only a subset of those reading them... that is a strength rather than
a weakness.  I have no interest in dance, but find the discussions of
period dance to be very interesting.  I'm reasonably certain that 
even people not interested in fighting as a personal activity would
find some of the details of what is involved interesting.  

	Although I've been fighting for several years, it was only 
last summer and fall that I found myself in a position where I needed
to train someone.  (Our Knight's Marshall fell and suffered a 
non-permanent back injury, our local knight was too busy in Pharmacy
school to train someone, and that left me...)  We took things very
slow- I *didn't* want Guiseppe trained the way I was (Go to fighter
practice for a few weeks and watch, then put loaner armor on him 
and show him what it was like to get hit... :-(  )(I exagerate
(slightly) but I recieved *very* little formal training when I
started, just lots of sparring.)  We started him out just getting 
used to moving in armor, then spent the better part of a month
just on shield work before I let him have a weapon.  By the time
I was leaving the area we had been sparring at half- and 
three-quarter speed for a few weeks, and we finally went full
speed one weekend.  Though he was a bit startled at the difference
that going full speed made (both in his performance and what it
was like fighting me) his shield work held up well and his offence
was acceptable.  I hope his training continued after I left, but I
haven't heard in a while.

	Anyone else??

The Longship Company is, as I understand it, formed around a core of
Marklanders but not limited to that group.  It is a sort of
corporation, with members owning relatively expensive shares, the sale
of which actually paid for the boat.  I believe that it is actually a
"short ship", seating something like 30 rowers.  I have not seen it
myself, but have friends who have rowed in it.  Apparently it is
frequently available during Disclave for pleasure tripping, though
normally I believe its use is restricted to members and their guests.
I used to have their address around, but I have lost it.  I think they
are working on (this is old data) another ship, this one larger, but
am not sure.  Their existing ship was not actually built by the
company, but by a local boatbuilder who was intrigued by the project
and did it for cost.

That's all I know about the longship company.  I have seen photographs
of other modern longship-like boats--but don't have much data on any
of them.  I think there was an article in the Smithsonian about a year
and a half ago about some guy in the midwest who was building a
longship.

Unto Nicolette Bonhomme does Orianna vander Delft send greetings:

Whew, where to begin?  I assume that you know about "bringing your own"
(sleeping gear, towels, toiletries, etc.).  I also recommend to anyone
crashing at someone's house that you call them in advance, say the week
before the event, introduce yourself (if you don't know them), let them
know where you are coming from and what time you will be arriving (I *hate*
staying up until the wee hours of the morning for someone who never
shows!), and get specific directions to their house (we've had some fun (?)
driving around strange cities in the dark of the night).  *Hint:  If
possible, get a street map of the city or town where you will be.  AAA
membership is one of the best investments I ever made for getting maps!*

Gifts:  that's a toughy.  What I have gotten in the habit of doing with
people I don't know is bringing something for breakfast.  A gallon of
orange juice or a dozen fresh croissants is always a welcome addition when
you are feeding several dozen strange people breakfast.  If you know the
person, you might bring a small token (their favorite
wine/beer/liquor/soda) or some such.  One thing that I have had happen when
I autocratted Crown in Thescorre and had a number of people crashing is a
couple of people did my dishes for me, both Saturday and Sunday mornings.
That was probably the *best* gift I have ever received (I *hate* doing the
dishes).  If I can't afford a present, I at least try to send a thank-you
note the week after I have crashed to thank the person for their
hospitality.

Finally, when you are actually crashing at someone's house, respect their
house rules.  Many regular crash houses post a list of the house rules for
their guests so strangers feel more at home and less apt to disturb the
normal run of things.

Message-Id: <2943@tank.uchicago.edu>

A good deal of what Awilda Halfdane says about the Horde and
Northwoods is exaggerated, to say the least. Par exampla:

The Dark Horde "opened the way for non-European personas." (Awilda)
In fact, at the time the Dark Horde first appeared, the King of the
Middle was a non-european persona.
"In those days North Woods did (not?) drink, smoke dope, smoke
tobacco, fool around, or Have Fun, and by God, nobody else was
either."
I don't know about smoking and fooling around, but during my second
reign the main organization engaged in making fun of the king was the
Mummer's Guild of Northwoods--including the Baron. They stole most of
their material, incidentally, from a certain comic strip featuring a
short king.
"They introduced and continue to maintain the art of belly dance in
the Known World." The first belly dancers I saw in the Middle were
Lady Morna (later fourth queen) and Morgana. They, or other personae
of theirs, may have joined the Horde later, but at that point they
called themselves, as I recall, the Northwoods Dancers' Guild. 
"Gentles who were foolish enough to drink a beer at an event were
politely (and coldly ) informed that It Was A Free Country, And You
Can Do What You Like, But We Don't Do That Sort Of Thing Here." I
never saw it. One of my activities at the time was brewing mead (that
was before I decided that part of taking my persona seriously was not
drinking alcohol in public), and I cannot remember any hint of
criticism or hostility from any of the Northwoods people. 

"not long after I joined the SCA, some where back around AS X  ...  
When I first joined I was warned away from those terrible people, the
Dark Horde.  There were some real sore tempers about the whole
affair." From which it follows that all of your report, concerning as
it does the events leading to the sore tempers (c. AS4-7), is
hearsay. I was there when it started, and that is not how I remember
it.

I realize that some of this is quite critical, but both Yang and the
Northwoods people were friends of mine, and I do not like hearing
either group slandered on the basis of second-hand gossip from
fifteen years ago.

Awilda also repeats (in another posting) her assertions that pearls
were more valuable than diamonds in period, and that diamonds became
really popular only in the nineteenth century, as a result of
advertising by the De Beers Cartel. In defense, she writes:
"I have not specifically researched this topic, but after many years
of reading history, original sources, and talking to people, I have
seen a definite pattern develop. which I have referred to both
jewelers and financiers, and had them support my position."
In other words, she has no evidence to offer to support her
assertion. If she would like to cite her "original sources," I would
be interested to read them. I provided a quote from Cellini on the
value of gemstones, which made it fairly clear that in his time
diamonds were one of the most valuable stones (after ruby and
emerald); he referred to pearls as "fish bones."  

As some more casual evidence, John Evelyn in the poem "Mundus
Mulieribus" (1690) refers to diamonds five times, pearls twice.
Randomly consulting jewelry books from my library, I find references
dating the rise of the diamond from about the 15th to 17th centuries.
Looking at period pieces, I see pearls used with a profusion
inconsistent with their being among the most valuable of gemstones. 

English Medieval Lapidaries (EETS 190) contains seven lapidaries,
ranging from the eleventh to the late sixteenth century. I can find
one mention of pearl (as Margarita), eight of diamonds (as Adamas).

I am looking for documentation on wooden swords of state.  I once had a book
on European swords with a great deal of documentation of beautiful ceremonial
swords made of wood (including a couple of photographs such swords surviving
from circa 1300's, thru 1500's).  Unfortunately I have long since lost the
book and can't remember the title (never a lender or a borrower be).  I would
like to produce such a sword (perhaps in black walnut with inlay), but I want
to have documentation again so that I can make a recreation rather than just a
fantasy creation.  If anyone out has such a book, could you please give me a
title? Thanks in advance.

Subject: Censorship in the SCA, not just Bawdry
Message-Id: <2949@tank.uchicago.edu>

Almost everyone seems to be against censorship of bawdy songs, so I
thought I would raise some related issues. I am a storyteller, and my
persona is Muslim. The period sources from which I lift my material
are sometimes sexually explicit beyond what is usually accepted in
modern American culture. For example, there is one story involving a
Caliph and two slave girls. One of them has given him an erection,
and they are arguing about which gets the benefit thereof, quoting
Islamic law back and forth ("the hunter who has roused the game
.."). The stories also embody views on race and gender not generally
approved of at the moment. Black males are portrayed as ugly but very
sexually attractive to women, women (sometimes) as almost
pathologically unfaithful. As some of you may know, the frame story
of the 1001 nights starts with two cases of queens having affairs
with blacks. In each case queen and lover are killed. The next part
of the story revolves around the point that it is impossible to keep
a woman faithful. (The same theme, incidentally, occupies one canto
of Orlando Furioso, so it is not only an issue for Muslim personae).

It is not, incidentally, that the story is consistently misogynist;
Shaharazad, after all, is the heroine, and there are other strong and
attractive female characters. One of my favorites is the young lady
who is brought into the presence of a man who has been enchanted into
the form of an ape. She immediately asks her father why he is shaming
her by bringing her unveiled into the presence of a strange man, and
when her father expresses surprise, explains that the ape is an
enchanted man. How does she know? "Well, Daddy, I never happened to
mention it, but I'm a powerful enchantress." She is later killed, in
a heroic enchanters' duel with the Djinn who had enchanted the man.
On the other hand, I cannot offhand think of any cases of black males
who are portrayed favorably in the Nights.

The question I am raising is whether your opposition to censorship
applies to what would currently be labelled racism and sexism as well
as to bawdry? Should I tell my stories straight, censor them, or only
tell the ones not too offensive to modern taste?

I have a second and related question. My persona is, and I think
ought to be, an Islamic Chauvinist, with a low opinion of the
cultural level of Western Europeans ("Franks"). He also strongly
diapproves of polytheism, both as a violation of God's commandments
and as an intellectually indefensible position ("contrary to the
teachings of both the Prophet and the Philosophers"). My general
policy is to let those attitudes show, subject of course to the
prudential restraints that would have applied to my persona, given
that he is living mostly among Franks. By doing so, I help keep
myself and those I deal with conscious of the fact that my persona is
not a 20th century person.

One consequence is that, when I recite a poem (by Malkin) containing
a reference to Odin, I immediately follow it by an "explanation"
interpreting Odin as a Djinn or Demon, who the Northmen falsely
believe to be a God--not only is such an explanation (I think)
appropriate to my persona, it may be necessary to cover myself
against accusations of heresy or blasphemy. On one occasion I got a
very hostile reaction from a Norse persona, along the lines of "I
don't say nasty things about your god, you shouldn't say them about
mine." It was fairly clear that the reaction was coming out of 20th
century ideas of religious toleration. The question I want to raise
is whether expressing intolerant views on religion is appropriate as
a reflection of what our personae would have been like (Cariadoc in
fact suspects that some Franks are cannibals, although not the Franks
he knows), or whether it is behavior that should be self-censored so
as not to offend modern sensibilities.

Subject: The Letter of Dance

Well, it's almost May, and the first issue of the Letter of Dance is drawing
terrifyingly close. Therefore, two announcements:

First, How to Get It:

The Letter of Dance will run every 6-8 weeks, assuming I get enough articles
to maintain that frequency. It will include articles on dance, dance
reconstructions (both new and well-established dances), and a letters page
where we dancers can talk about dance to our hearts' content without boring
the Rialto.

A subscription to the Letter will cost $12. For this money, you will receive
one volume of the Letter (8 issues), beginning at the start of the volume
unless you specifically request otherwise, as well as a year-end tape of
music to as many of the year's dances as I can find public domain music for.
For a subscription, send a check for $12 US, made to "Mark Waks", to:

		The Letter of Dance
		c/o Mark Waks
		82 Montclair Ave.
		Waltham, MA 02154
		(617) 891-3057

Those outside the US should contact me about prices, so I can figure out 
the mail costs. It will probably be about $18 for Europe.

The first issue will be out in mid-July; I'd like to have a good idea of
how many copies to print by mid-June, so spread the word and send in
subscriptions today!

Feel free to direct any and all questions about the Letter to me, either
by telephone or (preferably) email.

Note: Saltatio policy -- By request of Baron Patri, I intend to send 
complimentary copies to those gentles who subscribed to Saltatio before it
folded. If you believe that you fit in this category, please talk to me...

Merchants (particularly those in New England) who might be interested in
retailing the Letter, talk to me; I'd like to have a couple of people
merching the Letter at Pennsic.

Second, How to Help Out:

The Letter of Dance *needs* articles! Lots of articles! If this project is
to succeed, I need things to print. If you have anything at all to say, talk
to me. Articles on how the dances were done, about garb and how it affects
dance, about the evolution of dance in period, about how dance is done in
the Society, about period dance music and how to turn it into something
usable by a modern musician, about the fine and arcane art of dance 
reconstruction, and about just about *anything* else are all welcome.

Also, I will need music for the year-end tape. If you have a period music
group that is willing to record some music, or know of someone who might
be so willing, talk to me. Note that I am only using *legal* music;
contributions of copyrighted recordings are unusable unless I can get
explicit permission to use them.

Please, this is a chance for the dancers of the Known World to start really
talking to one another, but it won't get off the ground unlesss someone
starts talking first. I would like to have articles for the first four 
issues lined up before the first goes to press; that's a lot of pages,
and, while I have a number of articles, I need *more*!

Feel free to reprint/pass around/whatever this posting; the more people who
know about the Letter, the better...

Subject: Heraldic Display Competition
Message-Id: <Apr.27.13.00.39.1989.14336@paul.rutgers.edu>


Greetings to all from Arval Benicoeur, Brigantia Principal Herald.  

At Pennsic War this summer, I am sponsoring a contest for the best
display of group heraldry.  The contest is open to any East group:
baronies, shires, canton, colleges, households, guilds, a knight and
his squires, etc.  The main requirement is that the armory displayed
must be registered with the Laurel Queen of Arms, or at least have
been approved by my office.  Entries will be judged on the splendour,
variety, and authenticity of the display, and on the quality of the
workmanship.  Some further details appear in the May Pikestaff.

The purpose of this competition is to encourage groups, especially
large territorial groups, to use their arms more prominently and
diversely.  

The main prize for the competition is an oak war chest, being built by
Sir Andros ap Anlawdd, to be painted Master Berowne of Arden with the
armory of the winning group plus various kingdom armory.  A second
prize will be a supply of heraldic stationary, to be provided by Lady
Dorren of Ashwell.

Please talk this contest around, and try to drum up enthusiasm.
Anyone who wants further information, suggestions, or whatever, is
welcome to contact me.

As the Brigantia office is currently a bit shorter of funds than I'd
like, I am asking for donations toward the construction of the war
chest, particularly from the larger groups in the Kingdom.  One panel
of the chest will be painted with the arms of the donors.  Please
contact me for details.

Good cheer!

	Arval.

The BMDL (Barony Marche of the Debatable Lands) Barony Birthday last month was
also the tenth anniversary of the current Baron's reign.  During court the Baron
was called up to explain himself.

You see, he has a lovingly crafted Viking persona but, as witness after witness
was able to show, he does all his Viking on land.  Most inappropriate.
Naturally the King (with a little help from the Baron's 'friends' had to take
action.

So the Baron is now a member of The Longboat Company.  Said membership gives him
(and his guests) the right to help crew the longship.  He also has Orders from
HRM to take such a sea voyage in the near future.  In garb.  And to bring back
pictures to prove it.

(Now in response to the person who was asking about developing a lion-tamer
persona ... :)

Subject: My ride on a Longship


Unto the good people of the Rialto does Mustapha al-Muhaddith send his
wishes for peace and prosperity.  

I was hoping that someone with more familiarity with the Longship
group could tell this tale, but as it appears that no one is forth
comming, I will tell it myself.

The Markland Mideval Militia, or rather a special Longship company
does in fact own a Longship (in fact more than one).  As one of my
friends is a sometime captain of the Longship, I aranged to take a
journey on it one time.  We took the longer of the ships (a 24', 30'
boat (my memory fails me), I understand that the shorter one will fit
on a trailer and hence has made the journey to the lake at Pensic.
And I was given a first class birth.  First class birth consist of
bench seats with a large wooden bar in front of the passanger.

They have both a canvas and a nylon sail, and we took the nylon sail
on this day (it being lighter and more managable).  This of course
prompted the very quotable line "(-: If the Vikings had rip stop nylon
they would have used it ;-)".  The voyagers, there were about 12, were
divided up into three teams, each team had at least one experienced
member who sat in front and directed the rowing.  We rowed out of the
harbor past some of the most expensive houses in Alexandria, VA.  I
understand that there is something that makes the people there nervous
about a Dragon boat passing by them.  I personally am far more
offended by the modern boats with there large wake, I feel there is
something picturesque about a viking long boat, being a true sailor at
heart.  The coxswain directed the rowing by chanting "O-o-o--din,
O-o-o-din" over and over again.  It was hard work, and I was glad when
my team was taken out of the rotation.  There were three teams, and
two sides of the boat, so at any time there were two teams rowing and
one team resting.

When we got out into the middle of the bay we rested and ate our
lunch.  As the wind was behind us we then hoisted the sail to try and
sail back twards the harbour.  As longboats do not have a keel they
can only run (for those of you who are not sailors that means moving
with the wind directly behind you, actually one of the slower ways to
sail on a boat with a keel).  As we got closer to the harbor we kept
tilting the angle of the sail and playing with the rudder till the
boat was actually sailing on what was pretty close to a beam reach
(right angle to the wind) or at least a not very broad reach.  We were
all pleased as that meant we didn't have to row until we were very
close to the docks.  

I believe the Longship company made the boats themselves, or at least
they had them made for them.  I will try to get in contact with them
to find out how it was done and where plans could be found if there is
any interest.  

	Pleasant voyaging to all,

		--Mustapha

	M'lady, I see that you are in Caid.  If you have transportation,
I can suggest an excellent way to learn about Society heraldry.  Do
what I did, start helping out your Kingdom herald (hi Arval :-)  

	While I suspect details vary from person to person, both of the
Kingdom level heralds that I have known had a lot of work to do... and
usually set aside at least one night per week just for paperwork.
This always goes better if there are more hands to carry (and fold,
and cut-&-paste, and collate, and staple...) the load.  (Don't 
forget addressing and licking envelopes!!)  In the process you'll 
learn a lot about SCA heradry both in your own Kingdom as well as what
is happening elsewhere.  The Caid being a 'small' kingdom, with any
luck the Principle herald lives somewhere near you.  From helping
simply file and fold your first few times you can work up to commenting
on in-kingdom submissions (if you have access to something to do 
research in, I happen to have a well stocked library at my disposal,
but there are people out there that have a lot of stuff on their 
own shelves.)

	The newsletters (I believe Crown Prints has an ad this month
in fact) also contain the address from which you can order the SCA
Ordinary and Armorial, along with the various Updates.  All together
these now run about $50.  There is also a an excellent (to my eye) 
booklet out there entitled something like "An Illistrated Dict. of
SCA Heraldry."  I thought that it gave an excellent idea of the 
variety of charges in use in the Society.  Doubtless there are
other excellent sources that people can point out to you.  Good 
luck!

Subject: Cariadoc's corrections to my mead posting

I wish to thank Cariadoc for his careful reading of my mead recipe.

As he correctly points out, 
	1) tea is not period.  I have done several of Digby's recipes,
	with reasonable success, but my best meads have used tea.
	Can anyone suggest a more period source for tanin (preferably one
	mentioned in a period mead recipe)?
	
	2) allspice is New World.  I didn't check this, but I believe he
	is correct.  Again, I tend to use the spices available rather than
	worrying as much about authenticity as I probably should.  Anyone
	who does care should choose a recipe from Digby and follow it
	closely.  I recommend starting with one of the lightly spiced ones.
	
	3) My primary source is Digby, who was slightly post-Elizabethan.
	I never was too good with dates.  I seem to remember having seen 
	an earlier source somewhere, but can't think where it was.  I may
	have been mistaken.
	
As an aside, I find Digby's cake recipes excellent.  I particularly like his
"Plumb Cake" and his "Excellent small cakes" (cookies).

Subject: Dark Horde vs. Northwoods

Awilda, some minor corrections:

As a ex-Northwoods SCAdian, back when Yang was active, I have to point out that
Northwoods people were known to  drink, smoke dope, fool around, and have fun.
It was not unusual for us to sing Imperium compound ourselves at post-revels.

Of course, many of us were into SCA in a big way (Northwoods had 24 hours of
SCA activities a week, every week during the quarter--actually there were more
hours of activity, but some of them overlapped).

I think that Northwoods acquired a reputation in much the same way that
Carolingia did--by doing many things, they did some of them much better than
their neighbors.  People began to feel that people fell into to two classes:
those who were interested in authenticity, and those who were interested in fun.
My own impression is that those who were careful about authenticity were 
also those who had the most fun.

Northwoods at that time was known for service.  When a new group 400 miles away
was putting on their first event, 10 or 20 of us attended, and volunteered to
do kitchen chores, cleanup, entertainment, or whatever the group wanted to
help them make it a success.  I can't remember how many "away" events I ended
up pushing a broom.  I have seen other groups in the SCA give major service 
awards for what Northwoods expected of every member.  Of course, those who were
interested in serving the SCA beyond what everybody did, generally ended up 
with Kingdom level offices, and did get Awards of Arms after a year or so.  

Incidentally, "away" events in those days were often very far away--usually
400 miles through snowstorms.  Of course, the Middle was bigger then, as were 
the other two kingdoms.

Greetings and salutations from Diego Mundoz, historian of the Barony of
Carolingia, the East!

	My lord, I remember clipping, and may still have in my files, a news-
paper photo of a Viking "long-ship" built in the New World in the early years
of this decade. I believe it was done by a non-Society group in the
Wisconsin/Michigan/Minnesota region (SCA names ?); crewed by about 80 (??).
	While I have no documentation I remember a story that something
similar was done by another group on the East Coast, perhaps the Chesapeake
Bay area. (Marklanders, maybe.)

	Can someone else add to the tale, please?

				Yours in service to safer travel,

				Diego Mundoz

Subject: personas, performances, etc.

        Unto the good gentles of the Rialto Li Kung Lo once again sends
greetings! First, I would like to throw in two cents worth on the current
discussion of alternate personas, and then a word on the responses to my
posting on period music performance.
        My position is moderate on alternate personas. I can see Cariadoc's
point of view, wishing to do one as well as you can, and I can also see the
fun of Elizabeth Braidwood vs. Lizzy. (I'm sure I would appreciate them both
at the right place and time!) Sometimes I feel like both, because my persona
is precisely a period alternate persona. There are times when I feel
"homesick" or at least far enough from the inquisitors to expound on Taoist
philosophy, to dream of an obedient woman with bound feet, to reject chivalry
for victory through treachery, or just to be revolted by overcooked,
overwatered saffron rice.(which sometimes makes me wonder how "your" culture
survives) There are other times when I play the acculturated worshipful
Christian squire, who will defend the honor of a lady in distress, who is
loyal to the crown, and who might be called upon to lay down his life in
defense of the holy land (sorry Mustapha...).
        I suppose Li Kung Lo and John Lowe, esquire, are my alternate
personas, but they also represent the changes of a man throughout his
lifetime,socially isolated, and forced to adapt, not just to survive, but also
to have a sense of belonging. If it were not for fealty to my liege and the
pure love of a fair lady I should be nothing more than a renegade exile. I was
born, as Justin du Coeur said *quite* Chinese (I'm touched that you think so),
but I shall die *very* British, and I hope and pray, a knight! Why have an
alternate persona when you can experiment with change? After all, the knowne
world is a big place!
        Regarding my posting on performance, I tried to avoid making my own
feelings clear, because I wanted to hear from other people, and I have, both
in person, on the net, and by email. I wasn't expressing an opinion, but
rather the feeling of being caught between a rock and a hard place. Some peer
says, "Your majesty, you should hear this lord sing, he's a bard!" The crown
says, "Play minstrel!", and Eliane de sans Asile (a loved one of mine, who's
favor I proudly bear), leaves the room in disgust. How would you feel?
        I guess on this one I'll make my camp with the purists. Trust me, I'm
going to learn to sing in Middle English and Provencal, so I may express my
courtly love as a man should.(I refuse to sing Chinese, I've got enough
problems already.) Anyway I've got some idea of what the concensus is, and this
is my perception of it:

1. Carolingians are *not* stuffy A-cops, and we're not particularly more
authentic than any other well established group, but we are trying, and it is
our attempt that makes us seem that way sometimes.

2. This is an issue throughout the knowne world, but the people who don't want
to hear folk or filk at events are mostly quiet, because they're trying not to
spoil everybody else's fun. Also, they don`t want to be called "stuffy".

3. I'm more caught in the middle than most. Performing arts are like that.
I'll bet nobody twists your arm to do modern calligraphy on scrolls for court.

4. Like it or not, folk and filk are acceptable (read: they're being
performed) at feasts and bardic circles throughout the knowne world, and most
people don't have enough of an ear for period melody to know or care. Those
who have devoted a great deal of effort, even years of study to period musical
performance have characteristically received less recognition and cooler
audiences than performers of filk and folk music.

5. What do you do? Spend your summer learning Provencal. I'll be back...

                                             In Service to the Song,
                                             Li Kung Lo, OT

[Why don't me and that guy with the pointed ears get down on a session? Man,
that would *sound*...]

Subject: Personas and persons
Message-ID:  <8904260750.aa16890@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

My Lord Cariadoc,

You point out and apparent discrepancy in my discussion of personas.
Specifically, I say that people should feel free to try their best two do two
or more personas if they want to, while later in the same article I describe a
couple of gentlemen who are so thoroughly real that they would disrupt my
version fo the Dream.

There is no discrepancy.  I see no reason why people should not have as many
persona as they want.  Persona are characters we invent.  We give them an
illusion of reality by thoroughly studying the milieu from which they spring,
but they are only an act, a nd we all know they're and act and play along with
the game.

The two gentlemen I described were not personas, they were people.  They were
what they were every moment of their lives, in every inch of their bodies.
They never quit playing the game.  They did not put on costumes, they wore
clothes that were perfectly natural to who and what they were.  They did not
assume manners of another time and places, their manners and attitudes were
their own.

At first I thought the blue-eyed samurai was a persona.  Because, well, he was
Caucasian and I made the mistake of assuming Caucasians could not be samurai.
His persona was so well done I went up to him and complimented him on it, and
discovered it was only his second event, and he had only a hazy notion of what
a "persona" was, he was just being himself.  We continued a friendship, even
though he rapidly dropped out of SCA and went back to Japan where he could live
the reality instead of playing the game.

And Julious is a much older, more mature, more developed person than that young
samurai was.  I can't imagine him being interested in people who don't take
things as seriously as he does.  Julious does not "play the game" either.

We do.  Even if someone does such a thorough job on their persona that they win
the Academy Award for Best Actor, Best Historical Drama, and Best Costume, they
are not their persona.  At some point they take off the costume, go home, and
relax, and say, "Thank God it's another year till Pennsic...Maybe I'll make a
pavilion for next year.."

Those people are the ones we give our awards to.  How can we compete with
people who inherit their artifacts?  Some people in the SCA are excellent
bladesmiths.  But they fall short of Julious' heirloom sword made by the
Imperial swordsmith and given to Tokugawa Ieyasu by the Emporer.  And that
sword was  later given to his ancestor as a reward for his service. That sword
is one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen.  It stays in its vault except
for the rare occassions he feels a guest has proven themselves worthy of
looking at it.  

Yes, such a person could bring a lot to the SCA.  But he has his own students
(one of whom was the first American woman to be liscensed as a samurai by the
Emporer).  He has chosen a different way to live the Dream.  I respect that,
and while I admire him, I cannot do what he has done.  Nor do I think he can do
what I have done.  We are different people, each loyal to their own inner
selves.  We follow different paths.

Subject: Downtrodden Medieval Women

Greetings to all and sundry who read this missive.
And greetings in special to the lady who was unsure of joining in a society
which echoes a period in time where ladies were quite limited in what they
were allowed to do.
In truth, it is possible to find locales where this condition is less a
burden.  Such is the reason why Cynthia du Pre Argent is a French Basque.
Basque women served on the town council, and even assisted the Mass. (One must
remember that even to this day, the Pyrenees are remote, and it is likely that
few clergy passed through on a regular basis!)  The women had their own sphere
of influence, and the men spent most of their time up on the peaks, or near
peaks, with the sheep.  An elaborate whistle language was developed so that
they could communicate; I have seen it demonstrated on the babble-box, and it
could say things as complex as "one of the lambs is caught in a rift; I will
be an hour late for supper."  They also have an elaborate although flawed idea
of where children come from: they are curdled, just like the cheese which is a
mainstay of their diet.  But I digress.
For those who are curious, I reccommend the book "The Return of Martin Guerre"
which is a rather dry scolarly book.  I hear that it was made into a pretty
decent movie, but I have not seen it.  There is also the book "The Circle of
Mountains" which is the doctorate thesis of some woman whose name I do not
recall.

Subject: Quick and Easy Alternate Persona
Message-ID:  <8904260807.aa17581@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

Everyone agrees that doing a persona well requires lots and lots of work, and
very few people manage to pull it off well.  So of course I had to search my
memory to come up with an example contradicting conventional wisdom.   

The particular case I recall was Midrealm Twelth NIght while Hugo and Caitlinn
were Prince and Princess.  Sylard of Easgleshaven had been outlawed for the
kidnapping of Lord Robert.  (And thereby hangs a tale, several of them in
fact.)  Wanting to attend Twelth Night, but not wanting to be arrested, Sylard
came disguised-as a ninja.

Ninja were uncommon back in those days, and people weren't quite sure what to
make of him.  Nobody spoke to him, except Stepann who thought, but wasn't sure
that just maybe it was Sylard. All his attempts at communication were met with
Japanese monosyllables and polite bows.  Frustated, he wandered away and went
around accosting people to see if they knew who that mysterious stranger
in black was.  Nobody knew (well, I knew, but then I was crashing with him and
had seen him getting ready. And I wasn't telling.  But it was hard not to
laugh).

His prescence had a very strange effect on people.  This solitary figure,
masked, lurked quietly in the corner.  It was a crowded hall, but there was an
empty space around him.  People worked their way through the crowd rather than
pass next to him.  After a while of being ignored and avoided he got bored and
drifted over to a large group of people who were chattering non-stop at one
another.  They were occupying the middle of the room, so anybody passing
through perforce became a part of their group.  Suddenly people noticed the
dark figure hovering on the edge of their conversation.  Silence fell.  They
looked at him.  They then tried to pretend he wasn't there and resume their
chatter.  It was awkward and died, and the group dissapated.  The ninja was
left standing by himself in the middle of a ten foot circle. A man entered the
room, started to cross the circle, paused, looked at the ninja, and went the
long way around, through the crowd.

This went on until dinner time.  At which point the Fool's Court pardoned
Sylard and he unmasked.  A great shout went up from the populace.  They were
astonished.  It was wonderful.  And then the dragon challenged Sylard...but
that doesn't have anything to do with alternate persona.   

That alternate persona lasted for one night and was a lot of fun...the costume
wasn't anything special, the prep work that went into it wasn't much either.
If I recall correctly he didn't even have a real sword, only a boken or shinai.
Yet the illusion worked.  It seems to me that the principal ingredient
necessary for a successful persona is the ability to act.  All the research
does is reinforce the act.  And an impressive costume will temporarily blind
people so that they don't realize there is no persona.

Subject: Fighting Units/The Horde

Greetings:

One of the most coherent units I have ever seen (fought with, gotten beat-up by)
was(?) The House Elandris under the command of Baroness Saint Lady Morgan
Elandris, and trained by Ino Sir Ogami.  They were(?) one of the most feared
and respected units in the Known World (you mean you don't remember "The
Black Leather Band"?)  As a unit, they wiped out both The Killer Elete and
the Dark Horde in the woods battle at Pennsic VIII (I was there, I saw)
Several of their members have gone on to become peers and royal peers.


I could not stand by and read anyone write bad things about the Horde,
and not say something to defend(8-{)) them.  At Pennsic XI I spent a lot of 
time in Hordecamp in the evening (until *very* late) drinking and singing and
telling stories and lies, etc.  At Pennsic XII I was not spending nearly
the same amount of time there, and they wanted to know why.  Well, I told
them that I had been having a difficult time finding my way home after an
evening in Hordecamp.  They said not to worry.  I noticed, later that
afternoon on the map near the main gate that a new road had been added called
"Diablu's Crawl".  Well, they had built a road that went from Hordecamp gate
directly to the back of my tent (moving 2 other tents in the process) 
One side of this road had a rail that was waist high, but the rail on the 
other side the rail was about knee high (just the right height if you're
crawling)
Well, I think that this has gone on long enough.

Well, I'm not with the SCA, but I may be able to help. I'm into buckskinning,    and also have a freezer full of hides. Your friend has several options,      
depending on how much time he wants to spend, how much cash he wants to spend, 
or how understanding his wife is :-)

1. Send the hides to a commercial tanner or taxidermist. Here in Ohio, many of     the taxidermist will tan out hides. I have been told that it runs approx. 
$11.00 ( american) per hide but I have not recently checked on it. 

2. Purchase a home tanning kit. These are available from companys like TANDY 
   Leather, or many of the shops that sell muzzleloading supplies. They are 
   rather easy to use, and provide a commercial-like tan.

3. Brain tan them yourself.  This gives a very exellent hide, similar to a 
   fine grade of flannel. it is also VERY  messy!!!. The general idea is 
      1. scrape all of the hair off of the hide
      2. rub in a paste made of brains. 
      3. strech the hide out to dry on a frame. While the hide is drying, it
	 must be continually worked by rubbing it untill it is dry or it will 
	 dry very hard. 
      4. After the hide is dry, it is smoked over a fire. This will prevent the
	 hide from getting stiff if it gets wet. 
 this is not intended as a how-to to brain tan a hide, but it gives you the 
 general idea of what is involved. for more information, check with some of 
 the firms that carry  buckskinning supplies. They will cary some books that
 can give you detailed instrutions (they are too lengthy to type in!!)

I, too, have not researched the question, but I have a thought which
might reconcile His Grace's comments with Lady Awilda's.  Most of the
major sources of diamonds in the world are outside of Europe.
Therefore, in period, one would expect diamonds to be rare.  The
evidence of popularity of diamonds to which Lady Awilda refers occurs
at the about the time when one would expect diamonds from other
sources to be reaching England in significant number.

On the other hand, the art of gem-cutting was not fully developed
until after our period.  A few styles of cut gems are found in period,
but for the most part, stones were merely polished.  Pearls, which
come pre-polished, would thus have a greater allure.

Just speculating, of course.

Subject: Staying Alive
Message-Id: <2895@lindy.Stanford.EDU>

Basically, there are two different places you need to "stay alive"
in combat; The Tourney Field, and in Wars.

Staying alive in Tourneys:  Get REAL GOOD at defense.  (and use
Sword and Shield)  If you become good at shield work, you will
become more confident, allowing you to concentrate more on your
offense.  i.e. your shield should be "automatic".

Two ways to train defense:
1)  When practicing, spend some time "defending", i.e. take 20-30
seconds during a fight to "defend", not throwing any shots.
2)  Get someone to play "watch my sword" with you.  They just throw
shots at you, and you just block.  This help them learn to throw
good shots, teaches you to block good shots.

Staying alive in Wars:  Pay attention to where you are.  (and use
any weapon combination you feel comfortable with)  Basically, don't
get stuck in situations that aren't to your advantage.  i.e. if you
have a Round Shield, don't get stuck in the middle of a shield wall.
if you have a Pike, don't run around in the open.

Fighting as an individual in a War is basically a game of manuever,
staying out of fights that don't do your side any good.  Look for
places where you can fight to your advantage, or where the extra
body will help your side.

Example:  Attack the end of a line of the enemy while they are
engaged with a line of your troops, hopefully you can kill the end
person and help "turn the line".

Example:  When the enemy charge the gate of a castle, and are
pushing in, charge into the back of your line and help push the
enemy back out.  But when you are done, pull yourself back, out of
the line.

Think of yourself as a "reserve of one", and try and use yourself to
the best advantage.  This is much different if you are trying to
fight with a group as someone is probably issuing orders, but don't
be afraid to say "I'm not very good at 'whatever'" if the leader
wants you to do something you think isn't what you are good at.
i.e. don't contradict the "order" just that you probably aren't a
good person for that task, and someone else who is good will usually
volunteer.

Using Pikes/Spears/Glaives:  Basically, there are two very different
weapons, those with only points, and those with edges (and points).
I will talk about "Pikes" i.e. weapons with only a point (and no
edge).

If you have face thrusting:  Keep the point aimed right at your
opponents eyes.

Also, any time your opponent engages you, try and disengage, you
have length. i.e. start the fight over.

Enough for now,

Greetings my lords and ladies!

Three comments today:

1.Addressing David Prosser's comments on bawdy singing,
I feel that we are lucky when anyone makes the effort 
to entertain us.However , I have on occassion found myself
stuck (that's because getting up and leaving would have been
noticed and therefore very impolite) in a concert where I did 
find the entertainment offensive.I guess ,period or not ,
I simply  do not find any humor in songs about rape or drunkeness.
However ,situations like these , when you can't simply leave,
I think are rare, and discouraging performers in any 
way is too high a price to pay , since there simply 
are not enough willing performers.

2.O a related topic,I am a singer , classically trained and would
enjoy singing at some events ,however ,I know only a few appropriate
songs and am always weighing whether it is better to sing a folk
song or two that may not be period or to simply not sing at all.

Would anyone on the net be willing to send me either some music or 
source of some songs?I am a lyric soprano, and prefer  sad, romantic 
ballads.
If in paper you can send them to
Janet Catherine Johnston
Box 62 -MIT Branch PO
Cambridge,ma 02139
A response to this request will be repaid many times in song.

3.Also I would like to connect with a musician willing to 
do some accompaniment. I live on Plum Island, So  I think 
I could reasonably rehearse with someone in a range from Boston 
to Portsmouth.

Few if any of the duties of the Crown are relevant to how we choose our

Message-ID:  <8904261807.aa07335@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

I've had a few weddings myself, but none of them were SCA.  I've attended
several weddings af SCA folk.  There are two ways to go about it.  Have one
wedding mixing mundanes and SCA folk, or two have two weddings one in garb for
SCA folk, one in mundanes for family.  I've seen mixed weddings that failed and
mixed weddings that succeeded.  By doing this at Pennsic you've apparently
decided to keep mundane and SCA separate. That's the easiest way to handle it.

Well, to describe a successful mixed wedding.  Bride and groom wore matching
green and white garb that was from, hm, 14th century? And the bridesmaids and
groomsmen were also color coordinated, but not style coordinated.  It was too
expensive to get them all togther.  The bride made her and her groom's costume.
She also did two fabulous card woven sashes to wear with the costumes.  The
wedding took place in a small Tudor style chapel and was limited to a small
number of people-all of whom were educated to know what to expect and the
minister modified the service to more closely resemble a medieval service.

The reception was open to a LOT of people, and and mixed.  Many of the mundane
guests came in costume.  The couples parents were in costume.  Music was
provided by tape recorder and was mostly of the medeival "easy listening"
style.  But later, after many of the mundanes had left, there was dancing.
This was announced diplomatically.  But basically they said": The receptions
over, anyone staying behind will be subjected to medeival foolery."  The key to
a successful wedding seems to be communication, and attention to coddling the
sensibilities of the uninitiated.  Alas, that noble lady has succumbed to her
handicap, and is no longer with us.

A mixed success was caused when a couple was planning two separate weddings,
and their families said, "What's the matter, don't you want us to meet your
friends?"  At this wedding, each member of the bridal party was dressed in
their own personal garb.  The groom was Scottish, his best man Mongol, with a
several undistinguishable European types to fill out the honor guard. At this
point I'm going to delete examples of mundanes and SCA folk failing to get
along with each other.  Suffice it to say many people found it difficult to
cope with people who were so radically different from themselves.  Business
suits and t-tunics don't match unless both sides are educated first. 

Having gone on too long about protocol, I will discuss dress.  Medeival
weddings were a time to show off.  This meant regular clothes, but in the most
extreme, fashionable style the family could afford. Colors such as red, which
the family could not normally afford to wear were popular.  White as the sign
of purity didn't become de rigeur until after our period.  

I don't know about medeival, ah, premarital relations, but in colonial America,
analysis of wedding and birth records show that about half the brides
were "eager brides".  Meaning they had babies less than nine months after
their weddings.  I'll bet a similar rate is true for medeival weddings.
(With no central heat I bet a lot of people used alternative sources of
warmth:-)  

One piece of advice that worked very well for me:  Get married by a magistrate
several days, weeks, or months before the official wedding, and don't tell
anybody.  It means you will no longer have "stage fright" and can concentrate
on autocratting your wedding instead of worrying about things like whether
you're groom's going to chicken out at the last minute, and whether every
single item is perfect.  It is a myth that this is your day.  It is not.  This
is the day your parents get to show off how well-to-do they are, what gorgeous,
successful kids they have, and to enjoy being proud parents.  For the people
who attend, the wedding is entertainment. Lots of couples forget this and fight
terribly about the wedding. Forget it. You're hosting a theme party for a bunch of
people, nothing more.  And if you're already married, you can concentrate on
beings good hosts. 

One more piece of advice. Consult  Miss Manners' Guide to Excruciatingly
 Correct Behaviour.  Her section on weddings will tell you how to
do weddings the proper way according to modern etiquette, and is full of useful
reccommendations about how to handle all the planning and stay sane.  Even if
you don't do half of what she says, you will at least know what is generally
expected, and can choose what is and is not appropriate for you.  I have found
all her etiquette to be soundly based on good sense and to be very pragmatic
about how to handle mundane details like what to do if the flowers aren't what
you ordered.

And remember this, you will  survive.  My wedding gown was hemmed the night
before by the mother of the groom and her best friend.  She was thrilled to get
to help.  And the bridesmaids dresses weren't done and lady Muriel discovered
she'd left the sleeves in Milwaukee.  We couldn't find a fabric that matched
well enough to make sleeves out of.  She scrounged the scraps left over from
the dresses and added lots of lace.  Voila, a beautiful sleeve.  And nobody
stared at the maids armpits to discover that they'd been pieced.  Things like
this will make you go insane if you let them.

Subject: Medieval weddings
Message-ID: <890427001823.8.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

Milord Ulfin of Wyrmgeard asked how to perform a medieval wedding.

I am currently researching this subject for a possible future TI article.
When I sat down to find out about medieval weddings, I foolishly believed
that there would exist some sort of "Missale Romanum", an official Roman
Catholic manual where I could find the whole ceremony. Not so! The catholic
church didn't get a uniform ritual until 1614. There is an older "Missale
Romanum" from 1474, but that was never ratified. Instead I found myself
buried under a ton of books about medieval law, liturgy and folklore.

The rites vary much from country to country, and also from time to time
within the middle ages. There is no such thing as The Medieval Wedding 
Ceremony. What I have tried to find out is how it was done in nothern 
Europe from 1100 to 1500. I have found some sources from England and
some from Scandinavia.

Generally, the Church was very willing to incorporate pre-christian traditions
in the wedding ceremonials. Before Christianity, in the Germanic tribal 
societies, marriage was exclusively the business of the two involved clans.
It was first and foremost an economic transaction, not a religious ceremony.
When Europe was christianized, the church had a difficult time getting a
foot into these things. Most people thought that the old juridical ceremonies
were enough, and had only a small understanding for the need to have a priest
bless the union. 

The Germanic wedding traditions involved three ceremonial actions that were
necessary to make the marriage legally binding:

1. Engagement, which meant that the man and the woman were promised to each
other. This was part of the deal, and economic compensation was due if an
engagement was broken.

2. Wedding, where the bride was formally given to the bridegroom by her 
guardian, usually her father. This was done at a feast in the bridegroom's
home. "I give thee my daughter" was the formula spoken.

3. Bedding, where the couple went to bed together in the presence of
witnesses. This was not a pornographic "live show"! The significance was
that witnesses should see that the couple had gone to bed together.

Several medieval wedding rituals have been preserved, but even those from
one and the same country are different in details, e.g. the various parts may
come in a different order. Traces of how weddings were performed may also be
found in laws.

What I say here applies mostly to Scandinavian practise, and in some degree
to English customs. Things may have been different in otheregions of
Europe. The first part of the ceremony took place outside the church door.
At cathedrals with more than one entrance, there was usually a designated 
"bridal door" for this. The actions done there corresponded roughly to the
old Germanic ceremony. Even though this was now led by a priest, it was 
essentially a secular act by which the union of the families was confirmed.

When people had arrived at the church door, the men were placed on the right
side and the women to the left. If the bride was a virgin, her hands were bare.
If she was a widow, she wore gloves. In some countries the most important 
part of the ceremony were conducted in the vernacular, in others everything
was in Latin. In the latter case, the priest would dictate the words that
the bride and groom were supposed to say.

The exchange of rings took place at the church door, as well as the questions
and the "yes" (consesnus facit nuptiam). After all these things were concluded,
everybody went into the church and a special mass was sung for the couple.

I can't give you many more details now because I have only just begun to
dig my way through all these books. But I have performed a medieval wedding
myself, and we decided that the real medieval ceremony was too complicated
to go through with. We followed the standard Swedish ritual, but with a few
changes:
1. Medieval music was played when we entered the church.
2. No hymns were sung. Instead, a lady sung a gregorian chant blessing
   the couple.
3. Pater Noster was sung in Latin (by me, the priest).
4. Everybody stood up throughout the ceremony, except that the bride
   and groom kneeled during prayers.

Another difference was that the bride & groom wore medieval finery. The bride's
gown was black, since that was a more luxurious color than white in the middle
ages (white bridal gowns are 19th century I think).

If you have any more specific questions, do write. I will try to look it up
in the books I have here.

I had the honor of being introduced to the SCA by house Elandris, and
learned Sword and Shield under the watchful eyes of Hasdrubal, Ogami,
and others.

They are (were??) definitely one of the best units I have ever had the
honor/terror of fighting for/against.  As an aside, didn't Morgan get
an award for excellence with weapon, said weapon being "Army", or is that
apocryphal?

Again, though, Elandris falls under the house organization rather than

I remember my first Pennsic.  I had been told to watch out for the Dark
horde - to stay away from them as (I got the impression) Uncouth
baby snatchers or some such.  Late one evening, I was walking by an
impressive encampment, and was invited in to sit and chat.  It was
several hours of talking, listening to people talk, laughing,
bantering, etc. that I found out I was in the middle of the Dark
Horde camp.

Thanks be that I didn't know that earlier or I would have missed one
of the most enjoyable times I had that Pennsic Puddle.

Indeed so.  Baroness Morgan was made a Companion of the Tygers
Combattant  (EK fighting award) for her skill as strategian and
commander.

True, but their existance led to the formation of several other
formidable fighting units in the area (now the Princ. of the Lakes),
which were instrumental in the Eastern victory at Pennsics 10 and 11.
The organization started then continues to this day.

Here I am in a thoroughly non-medieval context. Have all you
computer wizards out there sent in applications to work on the SCA's
database? As you probably saw in your newsletters, the corporate

off-the-shelf DB management system (such as Dbase or Foxbase).
 
If you've got experience, want to make a substantial contribution to

Subject: weddings

Unto the people of the Rialto and Ulfin of Wyrmgeard particularly, Li Kung Lo
sends greetings! You asked for information on weddings, so I would share with
you what little I know. I apologize that often we are too busy to respond to
reasonable requests for information as we are involved in vituperative
correspondence (flaming those audacious enough to disagree with us). I only
know a little bit about period weddings, and nothing about the SCA versions,
but here goes:
        As Diablu pointed out, we cover a huge area and a vast amount of time,
and you can find that which aesthetically appeals to you somewhere in period,
and mix and match, if you want to. Among the pagan community, the Saxon custom
of handfasting became popular enough to eclipse the older Celtic customs in
the British Isles, and little seems to be known about them now. In
handfasting, the bride and groom's hands are joined together by a cord,
ribbon, or thong, thus symbolically joining them. This was done without
benefit of clergy, but publically, for all to see. Often the fathers of both
parties would tie on cords, followed by the older family patriarchs, and then
in turn by every person at the ceremony.(When we got through with this, boy
were my lady wife and I tied together!) This seems to be the origin of the
term "tying the knot". 
        The Saxons seem to have been neolocal, with the new married couple
occupying a new structure which had been built for them by all these relatives
prior to the wedding, or donated, if one of the families had an extra
structure. It was then necessary to "bed" the couple, attendant with the
public exhibition of the bloodied sheets to show that the marriage had been
consummated. To fail to do this was a disgrace to both parties, as the
implication was that she was not a virgin, and he was impotent. In earlier
times (dates uncertain), it seems to have been popular to hold a public
drinking party to observe and verify the performance of the marital act, but
later it became common practice merely to hold the party around the house,
singing bawdy songs and yelling out advice, words of encouragement, and
cheering on the newlyweds. This made the whole thing easier to fake, and many
an old woman gave her young relative a fresh vial of pig or sheep's blood for
those public sheets. This practice, in modified forms, seems to have survived
at least up to the 19th century, both in England and the U.S., where it was
known as a shivaree.
        Of course, the relatives and guests continued feasting and partying
with formal toasting and the consuming of huge amounts of mead, for a full
month after the wedding ceremony. This was known as the "honeymoon". As late
as the fifteenth century, references can be found to English men and women
going to Scotland to be married, and to hold the honeymoon, as English law
mandated that a marriage must be presided over by a (Christian) priest, and
Scotland had no such law. This may well represent the origins of going away
for a honeymoon. This is one of the many pagan customs that died hard, in
spite of the fact that all of these people were most likely nominal Catholics.
        Unto Ulfin and your bride to be, the blessings of Hearn and the Earth
Mother. I hope that my ravings are of some use to you. If they are, by all
means invite me to the revel, and save bottle of long mead.

                                        In Service to Nuptial Bliss,
                                        Li Kung Lo

This seems, in all, a most unfortunate situation, that one way or another
(several) someone ended up feeling offended and/or embittered and/or
unappreciated and/or generally feeling bad as a result of an event
intended to be simply enjoyable by all.  And seemingly someone lacked
discretion in _either_ performance _or_ response thereto.
So...
Well, what do we mean by "bawdy"?  OUCH!
It seems fair to say that "period" mores of public topic of conversation
and performance were what almost any of us would call a bit "looser" than
what prevails mundanely, even if our own preference is for the looser end
of the range.  Yes, there were intervals of priggish or downright prudish
superficial standards, but even then the (cruder?) aspect was only very
thinly varnished.
So it is probably fairly "period", and maybe even to be expected, that
"bawdy" be a part of entertainments.  And, assuming that the lady
performer was in personna something of a minstrel, or that the request
that she perform was anywhere close to in-role and in-course of the event,
then "bawdy" was probably not at all out-of-line or inappropriate.
That is, the minstrel in the prevalent case had license to do or say
somewhat more freely than other folk anyway.  And someone in-role or
in-course who is called upon to do minstrelsy had likewise the same license.
The extreme case of the former being the "court fool" who had license
to jape even upon the host or the most honored guest.  The case of
the latter being any interval of foolery invited or permitted by the host
and thus thoroughly implicitly granting license to all.
--
Now, what is "bawdy" and what is "lewd"?  Or what is "amusing" and
what is "offensive"?...
Well, describing one character's overly amorous pursuit of another,
or contretemps resulting therefrom, or doing a verbal "fade-to-black" like
in a movie seeing them fall into bed but not being shown the humps and moans,
or referring to a character's prowess or predeliction (or lack or ineptness)
without getting into anatomical description or precise measurement,--is
probably "just bawdy" and "amusing" and (PERSONAL OPINION) likely
offensive only to those who take determination to be offended by something
and, simply, pick a target of opportunity regardless of fact or consensus.
But, getting down to counting strokes, or measuring members, or having NO
element of humor, or recounting of sex (or other basic function) just for
the sake of recounting such topic, is probably "lewd" and "not amusing"
and (PERSONAL OPINION) not only offensive but likely to end up
being taken as demeaning by at least some persons of sensitivity
and shoud not be invited and should be chastised (sub voce, at least)
(post facto in prive, if possible) and should be generally and clearly
discouraged.
The relatively few folk who are SO sensitive as to find 'most any allusion
to sex to be CATEGORICALLY offensive should consider absenting themselves
from occasions of minstrelsy or foolery, unless they consider it their
bounden mission in life to impose their own mores upon the whole community.
And the likewise relatively few folk who take delight in simply being able
to put a name to certain basic functions, as do a group of first-graders at
the school-bus, should arrange to have smaller, non-public occasions
of such foolery, except that the lack of anyone to offend probably
removes their real motivation for such behavior.
Ah, well, enough is enough,

Subject: SCA weddings

Ulfin of Wyrmgeard sends greetings
  unto the folk of the Rialto!

   About a month ago I requested information about SCA weddings.
My posting was answered with but one response (thank-you).  Having
exhausted the local library for information on medieval weddings,
I now turn back to the Net for assistance.  I figure there are three
possible reasons that my posting found so little response:

        1)  The message got lost along the way and
            didn't make it to everyone
        2)  no one has any information to share with
            me or just doesn't care
        3)  the subject was probably already discussed
            into the ground recently (sometime before
            I got on the SCA mailing list)

   Well, I'm hoping that the first case is true and am going to
give it one more try on the Net.  So here's a reprint of my previous
posting (my apologies to anyone who has already seen it; I assure you
this is the last time I'll send it):


To all good gentles,

I find myself in great need of information and would ask aid of any who could
could help.

My lady and I plan to marry at Pennsic in two or three years.  Because of the
time required to prepare--the making of wedding garb, in particular--we would
like to start planning now.

The problem is this: we are short on ideas of how to proceed.

Information of any sort would be appreciated, information and sources about
genuine medieval weddings as well as information on what has been done in the
SCA.  Any SCA wedding stories are very welcome; the more detailed, the better!

Specifically, we need to know what forms the ceremony could take and what sort
of garb would be appropriate.

We would also like to have a feast following, with music and dancing.  How has
this been handled?  Are there any foods or music traditional to a wedding
celebration?

Please send any information--anything at all--either directly to me or to this
forum.

                   In service to the Dream,
                     (and Slave to the Machine)

Whaaa? :-(  Nay - Sing on!  If this kind of prudish ridiculousness is
rampant - perhaps what needs done is what I have seen here in An Tir,
that is, sing this kind of song late in the evening... ;-) I have known
those who have a "prudish" reputation to become quite humoured by bawdy
songs in the late hours... (by then, a goodly amount of spirits have
been consumed ;-), making such songs a little more "acceptable"?)

      Not by this person's point of view... censorship is like taxes - 
I can do without both!  -  A teacher of mine once said something that 
I have quoted time and again, not exactly period, but I think the sentiment
is apropriate - 

     "If you can't see the humour in something you take seriously,
      then you aren't taking it seriously enough."

Subject: Warrior Training

Etienne d'Argent suggests that he would like to see discussions of
training techniques for fighting on the Rialto.  While I am also
very interested in discussions of training, I think it would _not_
be a good idea to fill this space with it.  I have had several
ongoing discussions with different people about training and beginner's
armor, and found that it went on for a __LONG__ time - 10-15K messages
were not uncommon.  I think this is too much to expect the general
populace of the Rialto to even skim over, and for those of us that
get the Digest version, it isn't possible to hit "next" to skip a
long message.

I would suggest that people interested in detailed discussion of
training techniques email each other direct instead.  If someone
has facilities to arrange a secondary newsgroup/newslist that would
be great, but I do think it would be unfair to tie up the Rialto on
what is very likely to be a detailed, in-depth, wordy, and long
discussion, of interest (although perhaps great interest) to only
a subset of the Rialto population.

Unto the good gentles of the Rialto
does Nicolette Bonhomme sends greeetings

     First, my thanks to Jehanne for the articulate description
of the difficulties of being in the minority.  Frankly, all of us
are in the minority in some way or other.  Most everyone has been
discriminated against at one time or another - let's not forget
how it feels, so as not to inflict the feeling upon others.  It has
been very prickly on occaison to be a young, blonde, female software
engineer - it can be an uphill battle to be taken seriously.

     About fighting and training- there is a new Pike Company being
formed here in the Barony of Carolingia.  Although I am very new to
heavy list, I can see that this presents a whole new set of training
problems - formation drills, etc.  Are there any other gentles on the
Rialto who have participated in group efforts on the field of battle?
Isn't it a bit ridiculous how FEW fighting units there are?  My
understanding is that in period a much larger percentage of men on the
field were "attached" to someone.  Correct me if I am wrong in this.
What is it like to fight in a unit?

     One more question - what are the rules of etiquette for 'crashing'
at someone's house when traveling to an event?  Are you expected to bring
a thank-you gift?  What's appropriate?  What were people's good and
bad experiences with it?

                                      In service to the barony,

Subject: Carolingia's reutation

Sorry about the typo in the header...

Master Kobayashi's Apologia was a wonderful thing.  The Carolingian mystique
is just plain scary, and I'd like to help explode it, if I may.

On Carolingian snobbery:  Where?  I've heard many stories from people about
the famous Carolingian Snub Routine, and it probably may have happened to some
of these folks at one time or another... or maybe they just brushed up against
the wrong character.  (Every group has one.)  Perhaps I'm biased, or maybe
plain lucky, but people in the Barony have never been nothing but wonderful to
me.  They've been friendly, hospitable, and they welcome outlanders who wish
to participate in their activities.

This in spite of the fact that I'm a known Fun Maven who prefers her Coke
out of large bottles (the ice bucket is under the table!).

Carolingians don't travel?  How did so many of them get to Bangor, then?  How
about the ones I see at my events?  Or Quintavia's?  Or Stonemarche's?  There
are a lot of people in the Barony who never get beyond the T lines... but 
owning a car in Massachusetts is a major investment, and one's friends have
just so much space.

On the subject of food I will remain silent, as I've tasted some truly
INTERESTING concoctions in the past... but I will say that Marietta could cook
anything -- even chicken -- and I'd eat it.  And I hate chicken.

It really does bum me out when Carolingia's monthly events nearly always
conflict with something else I wanted to go to... but it's the agony of
indecision.  Let's face it: people who weren't going to the event anyway
shouldn't really complain about it.  On the other hand, many of us in the
Northern and Central Regions are trying hard to coordinate our events so these
things won't happen... or as often.

Next time you go to an event in Boston, look around.  Which one of these people
is an icon?  Which one is not breathing?  Which one will recoil in horror at
a friendly greeting?

I'll see you all at May Day, where I expect to have a wicked good time -- and
if Marietta's in the kitchen, I want thirds on everything.

Yours in fun times and busted diets,

Greetings, My Lord;

Your posting contains precious little information.  You do not say
what country/time you and your bethrothed are.  There is no such thing
as a typical SCA Wedding.  My own SCA wedding (4 years ago come War of
the Roses) was a combination of 14th cent. German and 12th cent. Arab.
(She is German, I'm Arab)  I processed through the site, picking up a large retinue, to claim my bride.  The public negotiations for the bride price
and dowry were held (with much hilarity) and then we processed through
the site together, families and guests in tow, to the person performing the 
ceremony.  "Father Peotor" performed the ceremony in Arabic, German and Japanese
(my knight is Atai Sir Yoshina) and we all retired ot our camp for the
party and feast.  When my lady and I went to bed there were 60 drunken people
belly-dancing in camp. (when we got up several hours later there were still
about 20 people dancing)  The point is that an SCA wedding can be anything you 
want it to be.  Have fun and let your imagination run wild.

While I've at times wished that more people listened when the group I
performed with sang or played, I figured that we were the period
equivalent of background music, and that we added to the atmosphere of
the feast even if people were eating, drinking, or talking.

Message-Id: <Apr.25.14.55.40.1989.13016@paul.rutgers.edu>

Greetings my lady,

I have always found travelling to events and crashing to be one of the
more rewarding aspects of the SCA.  You meet more people, and really
get to know them, than you can at the event itself.  If you're lucky,
there's a post-revel.  Maybe someone pulls out a guitar and starts
singing SCA filk, or bawdy songs, or telling stories.  There's no
better way to learn SCA history, good songs, good stories, and good
gossip.  For new people, especially, it's a great way to really get
into the culture of the Society.  By the same token, it can be great
fun to open your home for crashers at your own shire's event.  Things
are done a little bit differently in every SCA group, and the best
things come from shared ideas, whether its a great song which no one
in your own group[ has heard, or a new dance which is all the rage in
Atlantia. 

It's a good idea to come prepared to put your host to as little
trouble as possible.  Bring a bedroll, so you can sleep on the floor
if you have to, and a towel or two.  You'll probably find that it's
not necessary, but it's best to be sure.  I always try to bring some
kind of crash gift: a bottle of wine, something for breakfast before
the event, whatever.  It shows that you appreciate their hospitality.

Consider it your duty to offer hospitality and to return it in kind,
and you will find the SCA a very pleasant place to live.

	Arval.

Subject: Re: sword search
Message-Id: <2900@tank.uchicago.edu>

replicas of medieval european (and other) swords. I have looked at a number
of their pieces, and they are generally very nice--plain but real. 

If you read the catalog, it is fairly easy to distinguish the authentic
pieces, since they way what original each was based on. They also carry
some fantasy pieces, and some "generic" historical pieces which sound 
less authentic.

The person behind Museum Replicas, or at least the research end, is Hank
Reinhart, aka Ulric Greywolf (long inactive, alas). He knows his stuff.
If you stick to historical pieces based on specific originals, as described
in the catalogs, I think you get as close to a real sword as you can at
a reasonable (i.e. not many thousands for an antique) price.

On other alternative is to get real non-european antique swords. There
is an african sword called a Kaskara which is, in essence, a broadsword--
very similar to what the saracens fought the crusaders with (not scimitars
--they are a late development in the Middle East, c. 14th century). You
can sometimes get them from dealers in antique arms for a hundred dollars
or so. Anyone who is interested and in Chicago is welcome to call up 
(373-7881) and come over and see mine--I have a fair number, ranging
from "blade possibly in period" to "pretty poor."

Subject: Units
Message-Id: <2883@lindy.Stanford.EDU>

Re:  Frequency of fighting units.

There seems to be two major problems incountered when trying to form
fighting units.

1)  Finding a "leader"/recruits.  i.e. if Duke James Greyhelm formed
a unit, he would probably have all the recruits he wants.  However,
Knights "normally" prefer to train their squires/men at arms for
tourney fighting not for units.

A "normal" fighter trying to form a unit has trouble gathering like
minded recruits, i.e. doesn't have reputation to help out.  (I know,
I tried a couple of years ago.)

2)  Getting everyone together on a regular basis.  i.e. it is hard
to get the same 10 people to show up for fighter practice at the
same time, regularly.

Basically, there seem to be two kinds of fighting units in the SCA.
Those based around "households" (i.e. organized by a Knight), and
those based around an organization (i.e. shire or barony, etc.).

I'm talking about true fighting units, those that train together as
a unit, not just being in a group at a war.  i.e. the Westermark
doesn't have a real unit, although we may fight as a group at wars.

Household units seem to be more stable, as they have a central
leading person, who is obviously in charge.  And they seem to have
less "turnover", even if some of the members get Knighted.

The most successful (my opinion) unit I've seen (and fought with) is
Griffin's Guard.  It was started about 7?  years ago by Sir Brandon,
and a bunch of his Squires/Men at Arms/Friends.  Not all of the
members were part of his household, but they all knew each other,
and camped/partied, etc, together.  As members have become Knights
they have still remained part of Griffin's Guard, and their
Squires/Men at Arms have become members also (instead of the new
Knights dropping out of the unit).

The new Squires/Men at Arms help maintain the total number of
members (as some of the "oldtimers" are much less active now), and
the Knights maintain a solid core of experienced fighters.  I
believe there are currently 6 Knights in Griffin's Guard.  However,
the Knighted members are all willing to take orders from Sir Brandon
as it is his unit.

If John the Boftist is out there, he can give a better opinion as to
Griffin's Guard's success (as he is a member), I just fight with
them sometimes.  (They have a lot of friends, who aren't members,
but sometimes fight with them, as flankers or scouts, etc.)

Units based on a territorial area seem to have a high turnover as
members become Knights, and start households, or members become
Squires to Knights in other areas.

Subject:  Alternate personae; Authenticity police; Russia; Censorship

Greetings!

My, my, my!  Leave you people alone for a few digests, and you get into all
*kinds* of things, don't you?  Well, I'm simply going to *have* to comment,
shan't I?  :-)

ALTERNATE PERSONAE:  As has already been noted, most people are not
necessarily very serious about alternate personae (or, for that matter,
primary personae...).  For example, down here in Trimaris, there are by
necessity lots of "warm weather personae."  In these instances, the usual
approach is of the sort Duke Cariadoc described.  However, there are those
gentles who *really are* equally interested in more than one culture, and
manage to present more than one persona with equal facility.  One gentle here
upon the Rialto is one such:  Baron Seamus McRyu McHoo is as Scots (bagpipes
and all!) as Jutte-sama is Japanese, and Benjo-san is unmentionable :-).  I
never forget (well, *almost* never) to call these personae by their proper
names, respectively, because each is fully _there_, as it were.  As Awilda
Halfdane noted, comportment, movement, etc., are all intrinsic to successfully
conveying the varying personae.

On the other hand, his lady wife became Elspeth-Jean of Lochmaree in no small
measure because she just about *never* answered to her original name,
Kriemhilde (sp?) von Habichtslager (Hush, Jean!  You did *not* answer to that
name, even if you *still* insist you *did!*  :-)

I am sorry that Awilda hopes her friend Julious never finds the SCA, in the
sense that: a) his presence would probably do us all a world of good; b) we
could learn much from such a gentle; c) good role models provide something
positive to live up to; d) really good role models are hard to come by; e)
good role models challenge us to better ourselves.

CAROLINGIA/AUTHENTICITY POLICE:  It should be remembered that stereotypes are
easily formed, and cling tenaciously.  We would all do well to remember not to
be too judgemental, or to form opinions too quickly.  Likewise, we should
remember that most stereotypes have at their heart a kernel of truth, and that
there is but one chance to make a first impression.

Both "authenticity mavens" and "party mavens" bug the hell outta me, because
each represents to me an undesirable extreme.  "Authenticity mavens" who take
things to the point of becoming "authenticity police" are stodgy and stuffy,
and often fail to see the multiplicty of reasons people join the SCA.  They
also tend to lose sight of the limitations (read:  lack of $$$$$$$) on many of
our members, especially the younger/newer ones.  I often find myself thinking
that there are actually more appropriate places for people with these
attitudes; groups for whom accuracy of historical re-enactment is the primary
goal.  And, frankly, I wish some of them would go there and leave the rest of
us alone!  I'm sorry, but the guy who (years ago) once told me, *in all
seriousness*, that since his persona was Spanish he wouldn't talk to anyone
with French or English personae turned me off-- that kinda dreck *ain't* while
we're here!  All things considered, an over-emphasis on authenticity seems to
me to tend to stifle creativity and discourse between individuals.

I don't think I need explain why "party mavens" bug me.  :-)

As for Carolingia itself:  I don't know if this will be any consolation to the
Carolingians on the Rialto or not, but my only contact with Carolingia has
been _via_ this medium.  All of you have been very nice, and have generally
had something worthwhile to say.  I've been favorably impressed.  So, for what
it's worth, this whole discussion really surprised me when it arose!  I never
woulda thunk it by what's gone on hereabouts!  So, take heart!

RUSSIAN PERSONAE/COSTUMING:  For the several gentles who have expressed
interest recently in this subject, some hopefully-useful hints.  Firstly, try
to find info on such pre-Russian states as the Principalities of Kiev and
Moscow, and Prussia.  Also try to find info on the Rus, the original tribe
from which Russia took its name.  Remember that Russia, as a sovereign nation,
came along fairly late.  For costuming, check out Byzantine dress.  The
Russians adapted heavily from the Byzantines, especially with respect to
headdresses.  See the classic silent film "Alexander Nevsky"-- no joke!--
which presents the story of one of Russia's earliest military heroes, with
great attention to accuracy and detail in costuming (great musical score by
Prokoffiev (sp?), which was meant to be played live with the film).  Also, see
if someone has the recent TV miniseries "Peter the Great".  The period
portrayed is much later, but clothes hadn't changed that much in Russia.

CENSORSHIP:  Is a *bad* thing, period!  I loathe censorship in all its many
forms, both overt and subtle.  Performers should *always* be free to perform
(even as we should be free not to listen).  *BUT!* as has already been noted,
one should not confuse censorship with propriety and/or appropriateness.  I
have no problem with bawdy songs and dirty ditties.  However, the middle of
feast (especially if children are present) is *not* the right time and place
for, say, "The Bloody Balls of Scotland."  Some subtle double-entendre, maybe,
but nothing overt.  Filking and bawdy should be reserved for bardic circles
and the like, where people can come and go more freely.

With any freedom comes responsibility, and that includes freedom of
expression.  While no one should attempt to censor a performer in any way,
likewise a performer should show some modicum of common sense by choosing
material appropriate to the situation.  No one can make all of the people
happy all of the time.  But, if you make a lot of the people *un*happy, you
goofed.

And, if someone *does* have a problem with a particular piece (for any
reason), the proper way to handle the situation is *NOT* a public
dressing-down of the performer!  Your seneschal should never have allowed that
to take place; and if the seneschal did goof and allow it, the group should
have no just sat there, in my opinion.  Certainly, it is wrong to allow one
person to impose his/her own tastes on everyone else.

And, just for the record:  I do *not* regard the person in charge of
entertainment (be that Crown or autocrat) telling a performer "I don't think
that piece is suitable for performance during feast" as being _ipso facto_
censorship.  Sometimes, we all need reminding.

Finally:  Taliesin, do keep urging your sister to return to performing!  Not
only should she not let one individual's dissenting view get her down, it is
something that as a performer she will need to learn to deal with.  Besides
which, there are too many people who will appreciate her.  Not to mention that
one could take the view of triumph being the best means of revenge... (who
said that!?!  Not *me!* :-) )

REGALIA:  When Trimaris went to Kingdom status, lotsa people made lotsa
Regalia.   Nice Regalia.  Expensive Regalia.  Hard to transport Regalia.  End
result:  much Regalia that's *never* seen.  My advice:  make any Regalia
durable, adjustable and/or collapsable (as appropriate), reasonably light-
weight, and not unreasonably expensive.  And keep it to a minimum, because
it's going to be passed from Crown to Crown.

Since I managed to delete my copy of Dig. #315 by accident, I'm going to shut
up now...  :-)

Ingmar ye Improbable just made mention that it were likely that
period performances were possibly lewder than modern performances
are allowed to be.

Honestly I think he's making too big an assumption to make a
generalization over a period of time covering >10 centuries
and spanning >1 continent.  But anyway ...

I have to agree that he is probably correct.  I just recently
finished reading the Lais of Marie de France (The Penguin
Classics translation) and found them to be somewhat on the baudy
side of things.  The Lais are stories which appear to be told 
by a bard as some sort of performance-story-telling-session.  

These stories don't get down to the dirty details but .. fade
to black .. as Ingmar put it.  On the other hand the people in
those stories certainly have different morals than we do.  They
would have a loving spouse sometimes and feel no hesitancy in
falling in love with another MOTAS (Member Of The Attractive Sex).  
"Falling in love" meant, apparently, a physical attraction.  And 
so forth.  Read it yourself ...

Oh ... and some (most?) of these people who did dirty deeds to their
spouses (SO's) received retribution at the end.

Subject: pearls before diamonds
Message-ID:  <8904252055.aa10393@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

Milord Cariadoc,

I beg to differ about the relative value of pearls and diamonds.  I have not
specifically researched this topic, but after many years of reading history,
original sources, and talking to people, I have seen a definite pattern
develop. which I have referred to both jewelers and financiers, and had them
support my position.

Up until about the 18th century, pearls were pre=eminent.  Catherine the Great,
Elizabeth the First, Marie Anoinette all wore diamonds, but there is nothing
to indicate that they valued their diamonds more than any other gem.  Fiction
from the late 18th century uses jewelry as part of the personifications of
characters.  Well-bred, conservative older women wear pearls, younger, rich,
more flamboyant women wear diamonds.  And the older women dissapprove of the
modern taste, which to their eyes, is bad taste.  Obviously, the 18th century
in England saw a rising popularity of diamonds as compared to pearls.

This trend continued in the 19th century so that by the turn of the new
century in the United States, pearls, diamonds, and gold are the only jewelry
that is considered to be in impeccable taste.  In Europe, colored stones retained
popularity, but diamonds did eclipse all others.  Both Lady Di and Fergie had
colored engagement rings.  When I had a colored engagement ring, everybody who
saw it remarked on it as unusual.

This is the result of a heavy advertising campaign by the diamond cartel. In
order to encourage diamond sales, they advertised.  And sales soared.  Pleased
that they'd succeeded in creating a  much bigger market, they relaxed.  And
sales dropped.  so they learned that they had to keep advertising.  After a
while, they had a surplus of smaller stones, so they advertised composite
jewelry.  Small stones sold well-soltaires drooped.  So they manage their
advertising very carefully to keep the demand tailored to the supply.  A neat
racket.  As for how they avoid chiselling, they don't.  When cheap stones
appear on the market they buy them up rapidly-a fact the Soviet Union has used
to raise a few quick bucks in the past.  Obviously they can't keep this up
forever, something has to give.  What's given is the Soviet economy.  They are
now in sufficiently desperate straights that a few quick dollars is utterly
inadequate for their needs.

At this point I will ackowledge that I have exhausted my knowledge of the
financial industry. Money in the abstract doesn't interest me, all I want to
know is if I've got enough of the green stuff in my pocket to satisfy my whims.
(Alas, I rarely do.)

Subject: Deteriarata
Message-ID:  <8904252252.aa11767@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

Ah, William,

You have just encountered the founding principal of the Dark Horde:Satire. The
Deteriorata has been around for years.  I first ran into it not long after I
joined the SCA, some where back around AS X.  Who specifically wrote that
piece, but it's old enough and nasty enough it just might have been Yang the
Nauseating, founder of the Dark Horde, better known to the world these days as
Robert Lynn Asprin, successful science fiction writer.

Yang the Nauseating founded the Dark Horde as the antithesis of all the
stuffiness that prevailed in the Midrealm in those days, and as he lived in the
Barony of the North Woods, it was the North Woods that often came under attack
by he and his henchmen:  Good people all who felt other people's morals should
not prevent them from having a good time.  In those days North Woods did drink,
smoke dope, smoke tobacco, fool around, or Have Fun, and by God, nobody else
was either.  Gentles who were foolish enough to drink a beer at an event were
politely (and coldly ) informed that It Was A Free Country, And You Can Do What
You Like, But We Don't Do That Sort Of Thing Here

.Yang interpreted this as
a challenge, and perpetrated many practical jokes, some of which were funny, and
some of which were not.  Needlesstosay, the stuffed shirts thought it was
TERRIBLE.  The DArk HOrde grew rapidly and committed such priceless gems as
"The Song of the Peoples"  and "Imperium Compound".  Imperium Compound goes
king by king through the Midrealm history and points up the foibles flaws and
screw ups of every king.  In case you aren't familiar with it, the refrain
goes," We think, we think, we think, the king is a fink, a fink, a fink, a
figure of respectability.  He rules the kingdom with Imperium Compound, the
results are plain to see."  This piece of satire was deliciously wicked and
proved very popular .  Every place in the English speaking known world has
multiple versions deriding all sorts of people, but the kings are always
included.  

When I first joined I was warned away from those terrible people, the Dark
HOrde.  There were some real sore tempers about the whole affair.  Eventually
the stuffed shirts had to admit that the Dark HOrde did have a point, and the
Dark HOrde had to admit that playing their own game by themselves and being
insulted in public places wasn't so much fun, and the Dark Horde became an
Ancient and Venerable Institution of the Midrealm.  The Dark Horde still
remembers its origins though, and faithfully composes a new verse of Imperium
Compound for each king who takes the throne, just to make sure his halo doesn't
get too tight.

The Dark Horde has done many good things.  They opened the way for non-European
personas.  They introduced and continue to maintain the art of belly dance in
the Known World (a fact that in the early days earned them considerable hatred
from jealous women who didn't like their men admiring the Those Loose Women). They
have fed and sheltered scores of cold wet hungry people whose tents were
flooded in foul weather at Pennsic.  And best of all, they gave the SCA a sense
of humour. 

Yours in Service to SCA History,

Subject: Alternate Persona
Message-Id: <2867@tank.uchicago.edu>

There seems to be a contradiction in Awilda Halfdane's comment on alternate
persona. On the one hand she asserts, about Julious, that "if he showed up at
an event, the rest of us would look like little kids in the school play." That
seems
to mean that she does not think any of us do a very good job of doing one
persona--a view with which I have some sympathy. On the other hand, she thinks
there is no reason to discourage people from trying to do a good job of two
personae. But if we cannot do one persona well and if, as she seems to be
suggesting, doing persona well is a good thing, then surely we
*should*discourage people from trying to do two personae. Not forbid them, but
discourage them--try to convince them that it is not a good idea, and that
they should put the energy into doing one persona well instead.

Greetings!

I really don't know the origin of the following text, and I don't subscribe
to its morals. But I thought it darn funny, so I decided to share it with
all of you. Here it is:

Go nastily amid the Peace and Tranquility, and remember what satisfaction
there may be in Genocide. As far as possible, without surrender, move into
other people's space. Lie often, and loudly, and listen to the lies of others,
even the slow and incompetent - examples can be made of them later. * Seek out
meek and inoffensive persons: they are annoying, but fun to kill. Do not
bother comparing yourself to others: Those greater than you will eventually be
eliminated, and those lesser then you are dead already. Fart in Grand
Processionals. *  Depose your superior as quickly as possible: your career,
however exalted, is not worth an Ansteorran Thaler if one of your juniors gets
it over your dead body. Exercize caution around Vikings and Celts. They are
crazier than we are: a Celtic Mongol is an awesome thing indeed. Make him or
her your Friend. *  But let Life not blind you to the happier side of things:
many Hats are swaggering, tinplated dictators with delusions of godhood, and
everywhere Life is full of Incompetence. Advance yourself. Especially do not
feign meanness, neither be cynical about Hate: you are not likely to run out
of either. *  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering
the joys of defenestration and evisceration for more mature pleasures. Nurture
a deep-seated suspicion of chag'ua women with big boobs: you never can
tell. File your teeth regularly. Discipline is important: practice holding it
in between events. *  You are a Scourge of the World, no less than Atilla or
the Great Ghengis Himself: you have a right to be here. And whether or not it
is clear to you, no doubt the Known Worlde is going to pieces in a most
laudable manner. *  Therefore, do your utmost to annoy the Great Destroyer,
however you may conceive of Him: BoD or the People's Will; and, whatever your
plans of conquest, as you wade thru the morasses of Peace with fire and sword,
annoy your Soul. *  With all it's Truth, High Resolve, and Courage, the Known
World still has it's Ugly Spots and Fubba-Wubbas. Be thoughtless. Strive to be
miserable.

First, I should state that I am a lover of bawdy (if they be clever)
songs.  Second, I occasionally try my hand at composition.  I have written
things (at the behest of others and the demon drink) of which I was
ashamed, but sang in public even when sober.

However, there is a question of propriety, and whether the audience
has been given sufficient advance notice so that sensitive members of
the audience can avoid hearing things they would find offensive.

Please note that I am not condoning censorship.  I think that performers
should be able to sing whtever they want.  But, they should give advance
warning if they feel someone would be offended.  (A simple 'gentles of
sensitive disposition should be advised that the next ballad is of a
bawdy nature' may save hurt feelings on both sides.)  People who wish
to avoid such ballads may leave, haflings in tow.  They may not tell the
performer "I would be offended, so refrain."  If the performer gives fair
warning, it is the responsibility of the listener to monitor him/herself.

To the genetle who's sister deceided to stop singing because someone
objected to the "bawdy" nature of her song, beg her to reconsider.
There are not enough (there are NEVER enough) musicians at events.  If
there is a vocal minority that objects to the song, sing louder and drown
them out.  If need be I place myself and Life (that's my pole-arm) at 
the lady's service.

Subject: Music sources

My heartfelt greetings to the good gentles of the Rialto,

Two things.

1:  Oops, I spelled Canton wrong in my earlier posting.

2:  Are there any suggestions for sources for acceptable secular songs?  By
'acceptable' I mean those songs which, although they might not be period, are
generally bantered about at events, or COULD be if anyone knew them?  I already
have a copy of the Hawkland Moor Songbook, but would like other sources to
help build a larger repertoire of songs...  The ones that I have are
not really 'period' and some seem exceptionally modern in style, if not

Subject: Give with the music

Good gentles,
I deem this a proper time to ask for a preference
list of music both fun and useful within the Society.
I also see that this could be a long list, so if you
would reply directly to my id, I'll compile a concise
listing and give with the music herein.
My personal desire is to find something good for dancing
and relatively common at events.
Folk,filk,or classical.
thanks in advance,

Subject: Forks and Kimonos

Forks: The just-produced first issue of The Oak, the Atlantean A&S adjunct to
the kingdom newsletter has a fine little article on this subject (written by
Robyyan Torr d'Elandris, as I recall; perhaps he could pass a quick summary
on to the Rialto?).

Kimonos: I really must disagree with William de Corbie that having a persona
different from one's own genotype is all that big an obstacle. Two cases in
point:

Richie Munroe is not Oriental, although Li Kung Lo is *quite* Chinese. His
persona is well-enough developed, and noticeable enough, that the Crown gave
him an AoA scroll written entirely in Chinese (very, very pretty, even if no
one in the Barony can read it).

Likewise, Mussttafa doesn't *look* Arabic, but you cease to notice that after
listening to his storytelling for a few minutes. Again, his mannerisms and
persona are developed to enough of a degree that he *feels* Arabic.

In general, if one is willing to put some work into it, one can become pretty
much any persona believably. Indeed, many of the best-worked-out personae
have had just this sort of cross-cultural basis; it forces the person to
really sit down and think through the persona, instead of just drifting
along the way most of us do.

*However*, (and getting back to the point of this note stream), doing a 
persona well is a *lot* of work. Not very many people manage a single persona
to the point that an observer can simply talk to them for a minute and
know their persona, and I don't know anyone who can do it for two. 
Therefore, I agree with Cariadoc's advice: *let* yourself be Ariel in a
kimono. Unless you can really get *yourself* to believe in an alternate
persona, no one else is going to...

Subject: Performing at events.

The subject of performance of any sort at SCA events is a difficult one.
As someone who has in the past run the Jongleur's Guild here in Carolingia,
it is a something that i have had to deal with many times.  Here are my
observations:

1. Not everyone comes to SCA events to take part in the event.  Many
   (quite reasonably) treat it as a social occasion.  Therefore, unless
   the event is specifically and explicitly a performance (e.g., several
   years ago we had an event which was a production of Midsummer Night's
   Dream) there *must* be some place to which people can "escape" if
   they want to.  This means having two halls, or a "bardic circle" room
   or suchlike.  People who can hear the performance *want* to hear the
   performance, and those who don't can avoid it without slinking around
   in the parking lot.  (Makes for better relations with the local
   gendarmes as well :-) As a performer, i don't want to be performing
   if no one wants to listen, and *far* perfer a small appreciative
   audience to a large indifferent one.

2. As a corollary to #1, performances at the feast are *very* tricky to
   pull off successfully.  Everyone is distracted (food, friends, perhaps
   alcohol, darkness) and the hall is almost by definition the largest
   one at the site.  Furthermore, the audience is captive, that is, the
   audience is at the focus of the event at that moment.  Autocrats who
   would blanch in fear at the suggestion that there be an hour of music
   performance scheduled during court think nothing of scheduling twice
   that much during the feast, even though in many important respects the
   audience is in the same situation.  Not everyone likes singing, not
   everyone likes harping, not everyone likes belly dancing, and the
   annoyance of being shushed for an hour or more can be pretty wearing.

   The ideal performance for this situation is a loud group that performs
   well for about five minutes, followed by a "reasonable" break.  Most
   people can sit still for that.  I have also heard truly extraordinary
   performers (a couple of harpers come to mind) who kept an entire hall
   spellbound through sheer talent, but this is, sadly, rare.

3. Now (at last) we get to the subject of "controversial" material.
   While i heartily approve of having fun (in spite of being a Carolingian
   :-) and have through my, uh, studies acquired an, uh, well, appreciation
   of medieval bawdy songs, i also understand that many people are
   uncomfortable with the subject material.  The same goes for filk/folk,
   though in a different way.  What i have said above about "ordinary"
   performances goes double for anything that might be expected to raise
   eyebrows.   I personally would not schedule either for the feast hall
   or court (unless it was a Seven Deadly Sins event or suchlike where
   people should not be surprised).  It seems only courteous to avoid
   these forseeable problems.  On the other hand, there should then be
   no objection to the mere *existance* of the stuff.

   As an aside, the medieval madrigallists wrote in an elaborate language
   of sexual metaphor.  Ever wonder about all those "spent shafts"?  What
   *were* all those lovers doing "dying" all the time?  Wink, wink,
   nudge, nudge.  :-)

In summary, it is possible to strike a balance between providing
entertainment and forcing it on an unwilling populace, but it requires
some care due to limitations of human endurance and variations in taste.

In service to performance in the Society, i am,

I am again posting for this on behalf of Niccola...  Orlando

This, and other helpful hints, provided as a service to anyone who
would like to try to beat me at the Ice Dragon Arts Pentathlon next
year.  Print it out.  Pass it around.


DON'T POLISH ANYTHING UNTIL YOU'RE FINISHED HITTING IT

Don't cut the woodblock until the design is right.
Don't hem the dress until it hangs right and the seams are overcast.
Don't oil the wood until the carving is clean.
Don't color the illumination until the underdrawing is correct.

The SCA is at the moment a haven for the self-proclaimed craftsman who
presents to the public view items which were ill-conceived, ill-planned
(or unplanned), and which he abandoned as perfect when they were about
half-finished.

Your time and your materials are valuable.  If you do half-assed,
shoddy work you're wasting both.  You deserve to have your efforts
repaid with a well made, attractive artifact.  You're cheating yourself
if you rush into a project without planning it, hurry through a job you
could do better, or decide that it's "good enough" when it's really not
done.

I don't mean that you should obsessively refuse to complete a project
because it's not perfect.  Nothing is ever perfect.  Your first- or
your fiftieth- attempt is not going to look like the work of a
professional craftsman taught by other professionals.  On the other
hand, the dedicated and careful amateur can produce works of very high
technical quality.

There are points in every project at which you may reasonably ask
yourself whether you should go on to the next task or if you should
stick with the process at hand a little longer.  These include the time
when you think you know how you're going to make your artifact, each
occasion when you change techniques (you finish drawing and start to
embroider; you finish forging and start to grind; etc.), and that
moment when you first imagine you are finished.  Don't be sad if you
can't go on yet.  Your project is going to be splendid.

Subject: Alternate Personas - It Ain't the Clothes

Howdy folks, To be able to talk about personas, I have to be Donna Hrynkiw.
Please 'scuse the mundanity.

In Digest #312, Cariadoc says:
> ...one of the problems with alternate personae--people who
> try to have them typically end up with at most one persona. They
> react as the same person in different clothes, and others react
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  NOTA BENE

> celt doing in a kimono anyway)?

*That's* the biggest problem with alternate personas. Unless you *act
differently* you are still the same old persona. Just changing clothes
don't do it.

And a little later says:
> The solution I recommend is to have one persona. If you really
> want to wear a kimono, or elizabethan garb, or whatever, simply
> assume that your persona saw that kind of clothing on someone
> else in the society and decided it was an interesting foreign
> fashion and worth copying.

Also for convenience: Elizabeth Braidwood wears Celtic/Viking garb
during the summer. It's easier to pack, cooler to wear and faster
to make. But everyone knows that even if she isn't wearing a houppelande,
it's still E.B.

And William de Corbie says (Digest 313):
> It is very difficult to believe in oriental personas when the bearer
> is obviously a white caucasian.
PHOOEY. William, it's *attitude*.

Awilda Halfdane says in Digest 314:
> But just because
> they're white is not what's wrong. [interesting but irrelevant stuff
> deleted] But to tell you about this samurai.  He was new to the SCA, but
> he wasn't new to Japanese culture, and had absorbed much of the Japanese
> body language.  He was very convincing.

Here we go: Ask anyone in the barony - Her Ladyship Elizabeth Braidwood
and Lizzy the Kitchen Wench are *not* the same person. It ain't the clothes
(although they *do* help) - it's the attitude / behaviour / body language /
whatever you want to call it.

I stumbled upon Lizzy when I was asked to serve at a tavern night. I
borrowed a late-period bodice and skirt, stuck some gum in my mouth and
this...  this... *person* appeared. She's not at all like Elizabeth and I
only had to do a little campaigning to clarify things. ("Who's this Braidwood
chick I keep hearing about? The name's Lizzy and all I do is sling beer and
grub!")

An alternate persona story: Lizzy served at a rather large tavern that was
attended by quite a few people from not-around-here. She had a good time,
met lots of people and made some new friends. About 5 months later, many
miles away from home, Elizabeth Braidwood was attending an event in her
capacity as Royal Retinue. All during the day and well into the banquet,
she kept catching a local lord watching her with a puzzled look on his
face. They had spoken once or twice during the day, but only exchanging
pleasantries. As the banquet was folding up, E.B. was helping to clear
up and (falling a little out of persona) was bopping to the cowboy music
coming from the hall next door.
"Aha!" exclaimed the Local Lord "I *have* met you before!"
"Yes?" inquired E.B.
"You were serving at the tavern - you're Lizzy!"
I was still in my E.B. clothes, but for a moment I had fallen in to being
Lizzy - and someone recognized the change.

Other persona comments:
The strangest things happen in alternate personas - one of E.B.'s best
friends does *not* get along with Lizzy at all.

Dan Watson, of Angel Swords, is very knowledgeable about European (and

Subject: persona gender

As at least two others have responded in much more fluent words than I
to the posting "why join the SCA if you're not interested in romance", 
I shall simply applaud their sentiments.  Thank you for supporting the
view that there is much more of interest in the SCA than mating games, 
and much more to chivalry than cottonwool wrapping the "fair sex".

When I first tested the waters of the SCA, I was hesitant to assume a 
female role.  I have studied medieval history with the rest, and was
not enamored of the female position in life.  Uncertain of the authenticity
of SCA attitudes, I feared a chauvinistic, insulting encounter.

I hedged by starting out in male garb.  Let me assure you, this raised
no eyebrows.  I was addressed with masculine terms, and treated as I
by my attire requested.  The situation was perhaps more common in the
group with which I associated.  We had one dearly loved and respected 
member whose name I am desperately trying to recall - with little success - 
who maintained a male persona.  I do wish there be someone familiar with
her who might recall her to me.  She was an accomplished leather worker;
short, dark hair, quite attractive.  She was part of the household headed
by Lord Emeris of Ellenar, based in Tear Sea's Shore (Charleston, SC).  
She lived nearby.  I believe her mundane nickname was Elf (but I could be
mistaken).

As an aside - I have found that I retain little of the details of new
experiences - names, faces, locations, etc.  Is this common?  I mostly
remember emotions, typically recalled by images, almost snapshots, of
events.  I say this both to explain my inability to recall the name or
other pertinent details about someone I remember so clearly and to ask
whether others have similar recollection storages.

Returning to my point, I don't see that persona gender and mundane gender
or sexual preferences have anything to do with one another.  As I have 
become more familiar with SCA attitudes, I have reverted to female garb,
mostly for the sake of convenience.  As I develop a persona (which is a
VERY long and lingering process !!! ), I may switch back to being male.
My half-formed, jellied as it were, persona lives in a place and time in
which women were afforded somewhat more independence (exigencies of life
and all that).  

Ok, ok, I'm a Celt.  It's something of a cop out, as I'm a Celt in real 
life (ancestrally, that is).  My forefathers were tossed out of Wales for 
stealing sheep - not that they were alone among Welshmen.  My foremothers 
(?) were forced out of Scotland by the murthering English.  The joys of 
mongreldom ... I have also English blood running through these veins.
Enough digression! 

I in male garb have been known to flirt with the ladies.  I in female garb
have been known :-) to flirt with the lords.  I in male or female garb expect
and receive the courtesy of choosing whether or not to flirt, in which I
hope I am not alone. 

In male or female garb, I would not object to being flirted with by ladies.
(I am resistant to being flirted with by lords in male garb - the illusion 
becomes somewhat precarious).  Apart from William de Corbie, am I alone in
not taking offense?  Appreciation is too rare to be rejected out of hand.

Subject: multiple personas

About multiple personas - I agree that they seldom work.  However, I have
seen them work magnificently.  The real key would seem to be the dedication
of the person in researching and playing the part.  I fully intend to have
at least two personas, but not until I have spent the time and effort to
develop two separate, distinguishable characters.  I don't even have one
persona, yet - which may give you some idea of how much effort I consider
necessary for a persona (I've been in the SCA for 7 years - dormant for
2 1/2 of those 7).

I think multiple personas are valuable - if only to demonstrate what a
persona should be.  Most people seem to play themselves in a different
time, interacting with other people playing themselves.  The really good
ones I have seen play carefully constructed characters, and can carry off
multiples.

Ariel - to avoid "Ariel in a kimono", you might find visualization exercises
helpful.  Rehearse your name and your behavior pre-event, on the drive to
event, and in spare moments at the event.  You may find you want more research
into manners, etc., but I wouldn't let that keep you from enjoying multiple
personae.  People will go along with the role you play, but it takes a lot
of effort for you to set that role for them.

The Norwegians built a replica of the Gokstad ship in the 1890s and
sailed it across the Atlantic in 1896.  (It was *inteneded* to go to
the Chicago World's Fair of 1892 and the project was started after
the Spanish announced the intention to duplicate Columbus' ships and
voyage.)  The "Raven" is in the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago and not in
the best condition (it is under a roof, but there are no sides)--I have
heard that there is a move afoot in Chicago to repair and protect it.

Various attempts have been made to build long-boats (ships are kind of
expensive), but I don't know how much success has been had.

I have heard of an SCA-ish group in Maryland, called "The Longboat
Company".  They are affiliated with the Markland Medieval Militia, and
my understanding is that they have built and sail a period longboat.
I'm afraid I know nothing more about them.

I would not go so far my Lady.  Does disenchantment with one element of the
society (defferential treatment to women) mean that one should forgo
the far greater number of pleasures? (Companionship of like minded
folk, learning new things about the past, real good tasting mead, etc.)

Besides, cross dressing (especially for women to wear men's garb) is
very period.  If I remember correctly, a number of women who were
later made saints practiced this custom.

Hence, if any woman felt uncomfortable as a 'Lady', she could simply
cross dress and adopt a male persona.  Of course, this is not
that possible for a man (unless a transvestite rather than merely a
cross dresser).

Oh well, nothing is perfect. And I think the SCA creates a climate
tolerant of most things.

	I would also offer my aid for such a cause, however I am not
able to get to enough fighting meetings to be able to get authorized,
yet.  This summer I hope to get it done, then I would be able to aid
in such an endeavor. :-)
	
	The reason that I would be willing is that I find the idea
that a particular style or idea should not be expressed is wrong.  If
you go around not listening to what the people around you are saying
(no matter how lewd and discusting it might be), then you are missing
out on a large part of life.  This is your right, but you do not have
the right to deny people that want to hear this that abiliy, by
banning the music, or the expression of certain ideas.

Subject: alternate persona
Message-ID:  <8904231218.aa27880@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

I will agree that most people don't get as thoroughly into their alternate
personas as they get into their main ones.  In fact, a lot of people don't get
very much into their main personas. This results in a lot of Caucasian
samurai wandering around with cheap katana in their sashes.  But just because
they're white is not what's wrong.  The best samurai I ever saw was a six foot
blue-eyed blond Irish Jew (only in America, eh?  Wait till I tell you about Julious)
He had lots of kendo training and *moved* like a Japanese.  That's part of the
key.  He also had the dignified manner and some neat clothes that he bought at a
flea market at a Buddhist temple.  Old Noh costumes.  Sigh.  A little worn
around the edges, but real old clothes looked like, well, real clothes.  Face
it, our costumes are only costumes, hauled out for special occassions and taken
care of (Mostly.  We have mechanical laudresses after all).  Most SCA costumes
don't have the air of reality that comes from every day use.  (One of the
reasons I try to stick to practical peasant type clothes.  Acrylic satin looks
modern, even if it is a reasonably facsimile of a medeival fabric).

But to tell you about this samurai.  He was new to the SCA, but he wasn't new
to Japanese culture, and had absorbed much of the Japanese body language.  He
was very convincing.  And as for a black being able to be a Japanese, I've seen
that superbly done.

Julious  has never heard of the SCA, he is what he is in his one and only
mundane life.  Julious is Negro-Irish-Japanese doctor of divinity, sensei of
iaijutsu and licensed samurai. This man is the sole heir to an ancient family
that served under Tokugawa Ieyasu- and I've seen the proof.  I have also seen
the papers signed by Emporer Hirohito recognizing and liscensing him as
samurai.  I have seen his family heirloom swords, I have seen his iaijutsu
trophies,  and mostly, I have seen the exact integrity of his manners and
personality. I have also seen a lot of fakes, a lot of people who put on airs, 
and some people who are liars.  Julious is the real thing, and it is a
privelege and an honor to know him. 

What the upshot of all this means is that if you live your persona fully, people
will recognize it and respond to it, in spite of surface contradictions.  And
if you want to put this effort into several different personas, why not?  Most
of us don't work that hard, and so yes, our alternate personas are "Ariel in a
kimono".  But just because most of us don't do it is no reason to discourage
people from trying.

And now I'll say something heretical:  I hope Julious never discovers the SCA.
If he showed up at an event, the rest of us would look like little kids in the
school play.  And that would be just as disruptive to the Dream as mundanes in
their t-shirts and sneakers.

  Well, let's see: suppose hypothetcally that you were a homosexual lady who
is interested in blackwork, making 15th century Ottoman chain mail, fighting
in hand-to-hand combat, playing the krummhorn, acting in Commedia del' Arte
plays, trying out ancient methods of etching metals and stone, dancing old
dances, and experimenting with putting currants, cinnamon and apricots into
meat dishes (i.e. you are a shoe-in for both Curses of the Ice Dragon :-D):
  You could start/join a sewing club.
  You could turn your garage/potting shed into a foundry.
  You could join a Tae Kwan Do class.
  If you were of professional musician caliber, you could try to join a
Collegium Musicum, supposing there were other people in your area who play
ancient instruments.  Or you could tootle in your garage/potting shed.
  You could try to find some other dramatically inclined people who would
put on a play in your garage/potting shed with you.
  You could turn your garage/potting shed into an etching studio.
  You could find or start a Country/Contra Dance group in your area and
try teaching people Earl of Salisbury or Pease Bransle for a change of pace.
  You could read old cook books and try to convince your significant other
who thinks that eating out means going to McDonald's that "Compost" is really
quite delicious.
...or you could join the SCA and find a lot of other people who are interested
in the same things you like to do and in other things that you hadn't heard of
before, and with whom you can trade ideas, experiences and war stories.  This
sounds more productive and more fun to me.

	...I find it hard to understand why a woman would

 well, of the top of my head I can think of the following possibilities:  
she's interested in medieval or rennaissance music, medieval or renassance 
singing, medieval or rennaissance drama, calligraphy or illumination, or she 
saw some sca people fighting or fencing in the round and thought it looked 
fun, or some of her freinds dragged her to an event and she met a few 
intelligent and not-biggoted people and had a fun time, or...

There is more to the sca than romance and courtesy (some people actually do 
research, and some people enjoy the planning, work and coordination that go 
into running events, for example).

There is more to romance than being swept off your feet and being made 
passionate love to.  There is, for instance, loyalty to your liege lord and to 
your comrads, and bravery and daring in the field of battle,  or meeting 
another one-on-one in the field of honor or the fencing lists, (if you don't 
think rapier is romantic, youv'e been watching the wrong movies)

There is more to courtesy than being bowed and flourished to and being treated 
like a rare, wonderfull, and delicate flower to be cossetted and protected.  
There is being treated with respect.  There is having one's efforts recognised 
and accnowledged, and ones lapses politely ignored, or helped over.  There is 
being offered assistance not because you're helpless or shouldn't be working 
but simply and honestly because two more arms or legs would be usefull.


The range of interests and activities in the sca is very large and there are 
many many things in it for a person who doesnt want to be made to feel less 
than perfectly free an independant or who doesn't wish to be handed a clove 
lemond and then mauled by something that resembles a cross between an octopus 
and a saint bernard.

	you've picked yourself a toughie...i don't think there are any good 
sources for early russian garb.  The icons that i remember show a simple veil

hard to tell.  Anyway if anyone does make comments, i suggest you just gush 
at them, "oo, do you have documentation for 11 century russian woman's garb?  
i'd just love to see it, i havn't been able to find anything satisfactory."  
That should either shut them up, or get you some documentation.

we had a russian theme event here a while ago, and i managed to glean the 
following facts from folktales, which were probably written down in the 19th 
century, but may have older roots:

	1.	Russians spend most of their time either being beaten or 
trying to think up reasons to beat others.
	2.	Russian soldiers are absolutely fearless, but, 
	3. 	They desert frequently, because they get tired of being beaten 
constantly and never getting paid.
	4.	Russian horses are smarter than russan heros.
	5.	the flesh of russians is tasty and nutricious.
	6.	St. Nicolas will help absolutely *anyone*
	7.	Whenever a russian reaches the end of his resourses and has no 
money and no prospects he goes to the tavern and procedes to drink himself 
into a stupor; he continues to spend all his time drinking untill significant 
money or prospects show up
		7a.	alcohol is cheaper than dirt in russia.
	8.	Russian judges are cronically aflicted with deafness which can 
be cured by the application of money.
	9.	Russian riddle:  The field is immesurable, the sheep are 
uncountable, the shepard has horns.
		9a.  	similarly:  there is a crust over the roof of the 
house, the dog barks, but cannot reach it.  or:  there is a cheeze on the 
shelf, the dog as above.
	10.	Russian saying:  God is high, the tzar is far away.

Subject: Censorship

  Unfortunatly, censorship is one of the things from the middle ages that we
haven't even managed to stomp out in the 'modern' world.  There are things that
90% of the people consider fun, while 10% take it as offensive.

    Since my persona is that of a minstrel, this is something that I've given a
good deal of thought to, with less than satisfactory results.  My advice to the
good gentle that sang the song is to remember this equation.

    Offending 1 person (not royalty)  =   Tough luck buddy.
    Offending 2              "        =   Change a word or two, perhaps?
    Offending 3              "        =   Would changing the song a little ruin
                                          it beyond all repair?
    Offending 4 or more      "        =   Change it, or perform it only for
                                          those people who you know would
                                          enjoy it.

    Even the performers today have different sets of songs that they will
sing based on the audiences responses to their previous songs,  as I'm sure
they did in the middle ages.  No documentation on this of course, but people
have had preferences and were motivated by the same base things since time
started.  The performers are going to have songs that they love to perform,
and damn the torpedos if someone doesn't like them, and the audiences have
had their favorites that made the performers wince each time they were
requested.
    Moderation should still be practiced, of course.  There are songs that
can cause one to be chased about with non regulation weapons (although duct
tape is still optional 8-).

    Please please PLEASE beg her to keep performing... The discomfort of one
person complaining is by FAR out weighed by the happiness that a group of
people can experience through the enjoyment of a good song.  A good song helps
to bring about a sense of fellowship and friendliness (you've all experienced
it, looking around and seeing everyone else smiling at the same joke or play
on words) and communication.  They spur communications, breaking down the walls
by helping to start conversations and discussions, and (most certainly
important) spread information and ideas that would otherwise be tedious to
sit through a workshop or class to learn.

    But enough, there are others would will most certainly feel strong enough
to post their own views on this subject....

The Crown Principality of Ealdormere, mundanely much of Ontario, Canada
is currently considering its principality regalia. I'd like to toss a
question on the virtual floor - what regalia have you seen and liked or
disliked.

All kinds of things are up for grabs - sword of state, bow of state,
coronets, collars, shields, cups, orbs, (pentacles :^), scepters, etc.

Any and all thoughts will be appreciated.

Me personally I think that coronets and swords are good, but some other
things might be neat, too. Anyone know what the significance of the orb
in the British Regalia is?

Greetings to you, Li Kung,

    Not having more breath in An Tir than a simple subject of the Crown,
I don't think I can speak for more than the Household I belong to, but
those of the Golden Wolf certainly enjoy "non-period 'medieval' songs" 
(a rather recent album we all enjoy at an event is "Songs from the Wood"
by none-other-than Jethro Tull...."Broadsword and the Beast" is also 
very good)  Those gentles who pass our encampment when the "Bard-in-the-Box"
is playing certainly seem to enjoy that music as well :-) 

    By-the-way, To the Barony of the Flame: Wey Teague Trevor sends 
his greetings and good wishes - he his the Lord of my Household, and would
like to send his greetings to his old household... (Golden Swan?, my

  Alternately, how about if I, as a homosexual male, choose a homosexual

Well, by the position I (and many other) take, the Crown is defined
to be held by two persons of opposite gender.  Sexuality has nothing
to do with it; the game is 'Middle Ages' and Kings have Queens of
opposite gender.

Carolingia:

Sounds like a wonderful place. Rampant authenticity! Must go there sometime!
I agree with those gentles who have said that there is no right way to do
the SCA, but there are different ways. Every group can choose its own style.
Authenticity is good. If you can't, or don't want to be 100% authentic, that's
OK too. (Being 100% mundane, in clothing or behavior, is NOT OK though.)

Alternate personas:

I believe that another reason why Ariel's alternate Japanese persona is
perceived as "Ariel in a kimono" may be that Ariel is not Japanese. It is
very difficult to believe in oriental personas when the bearer is obviously
a white caucasian. What about a blond Scandinavian type of person who wants
to be Lord Mbwane of Zwaziland? Or what about a black Viking? Or a Chinese
Anglo-Saxon? Certainly, all of these are permitted. But if your persona
is totally out of line with your physical appearance, people will unfortunately
get the wrong idea. Not much anyone can do about that. It's easier to be
someone looking like you do.

Forks:

The fork is indeed an ancient invention. Even the Romans had them. But how
were the forks used? Modern manners say you should cut the food in small
pieces with your knife, on your plate. Then you use the fork to bring a
piece of food to your mouth. I think that it's not likely that people used
their forks like that in the middle ages. More probably, the fork was used
to protect the hands from getting burned by hot food. They would use it to
take a piece of hot meat from the servant's tray. They would use the fork
to hold up the food in front of them while they gnawed at it. 

Another thing that probably was different was the use of the knife. They
did not have china plates, but wooden or metal plates. These aren't hard
enough to stand the kind of food-cutting that we do today. I don't believe
they cut against the plate. Rather, the technique would be to use their
teeth as much as possible and only cut with the knife to get a chunk from
the steak.

I cannot document this, but it makes more sense that way, right?

This seems to be a problem that plagues the mundane world, and I had much
hoped that the world of the SCA would be free of it.  However, a vocal
minority will always draw more attention than a silent majority.

One possible solution is to have the bawdier songs included as a separate
part of your banquets or events, so that those who do not wish to hear these
charming tunes (as most of them are, in spite of, or perhaps because of,
their lewd contents) may move elsewhere.  This will, of course, provoke
remarks about segregation, but when two groups wish to pursue two separate
activities, then the easiest way to avoid strife is to separate the groups
physically

Censorship is not a good thing under any circumstance, and if someone from
your household has taken the time to learn and create her own music, be it
bawdy or otherwise, then such talent should never be overlooked, even if a
select few disagree with the end result.

Should these problems persist, I have a few fighters in my canton who would
be more than willing to champion a good cause ... :-)

     Interesting question, though it's the wrong way around.  You have to
choose your Consort before you fight in Crown Tournament.
     Speaking of which, when is anyone else going to say anything about
what to replace Crown Tournaments with?  I'd at least like to see a summary
of the discussion which some people are supposed to have had many months
ago, which I (and probably many other people now on the net) missed.

Subject: Ariel in a kimono (alternative personae, problems with)
Message-Id: <2834@tank.uchicago.edu>

or
Ariel in a kimono

Ariel of Caer Myrddin  comments that her alternate (japanese)
persona is generally interpreted as just "Ariel in a Kimono."
That is one of the problems with alternate personae--people who
try to have them typically end up with at most one persona. They
react as the same person in different clothes, and others react
to them as the same person in different clothes--making it
harder for either side to believe in even one persona (what is a
celt doing in a kimono anyway)? I can think of only two or three
exceptions, in my own experience in the SCA.

The second problem is that no one, or at least no one I know,
myself included, does a really adequate job of one persona, so
trying two or three makes the outcome even worse.

The solution I recommend is to have one persona. If you really
want to wear a kimono, or elizabethan garb, or whatever, simply
assume that your persona saw that kind of clothing on someone
else in the society and decided it was an interesting foreign
fashion and worth copying. You may know that it is from two
thousand miles away or five hundred years in the future, but
your persona does not know that. It is simply attractive foreign
dress. The same works for armor, dancing, etc. It blurs your
persona a little--sticking to things your persona could actually
have worn, done, etc. would produce a more believable
persona--but it is far better than multiple personae.

Unto the good ladies and lords of the Rialto, greetings.

I have not received any new replies to my query in the past few days,
so herewith the promised summary.

According to Hal Ravn (Province of the Mists, West Kingdom; Wilson H.
Heydt, Jr., whh@pbhya.pacbell.com), the Knowne World Handbook may be
procured by writing to
    The Society for Creative Anachronism, Inc.
    Office of the Stock Clerk
    P.O. Box 360743
    Milpitas, CA 95035-0743
According to Juls Siwaldsen (Stephen Goldschmit, aluko@Portia.stanford.edu)
it costs $8 U.S., plus 20% if 1st class shipping is desired; he also
confirmed the Stock Clerk address given above.

Says Dani of the Seven Wells (Dani Zweig, haste+@andrew.cmu.edu):
"Beast" and "Lady Tudor-Glitz" are sold by the artist, Veleda of
Isenfir; she sells them at Pennsic.  Juls Siwaldsen says the "author"
(? perhaps he means "artist"?) recently moved to the Midrealm, so she
and Moongate Designs no longer live in Arvonia, Virginia, which was
the old address.  He suggests
        Karen Everson
        P.O. Box 2708
        Dearborn MI 48123
and that the cost should be around $5.  He says that "Lady
Tudor-Glitz" was up to 5 books last he checked.  Ariel of Caer
Myrddin (Shire of Malagentia; Karen J. Norteman, norteman%
discvr.dec@decwrl.dec.com) says that the author of Lady Tudor-Glitz
is Bronwyn Jourdemaine in the BMDL (Barony-Marche of the Debatable
Lands, I believe); she suggests contacting Marian Greenleaf, a
frequent poster, who lives in BMDL.

By the way, Arval (Joshua Mittleman, joshua@paul.rutgers.edu) reports
that Isenfir is Charlottesville, Virginia.  (Despite its name, Arvonia
is not an SCA name, but a town 25 miles south of Charlottesville.)  He
also says that Tournaments Illustrated usually has an order form for
the Known World Handbook.

Many thanks, good gentles!

Those quibbles aside, you seem to be doing lots of useful

On the subject of bread yeast, incidentally, we routinely use
it for Digby's "Weak honey drink" (aka Small Mead), and

Message-Id: <2836@tank.uchicago.edu>


There is *no* right or wrong way of dealing with the Current
Middle Ages, but there are different ways. People who think that
Carolingia must be stuffy because of its emphasis on
authenticity (which isn't really all that much stronger than in
most places I've seen) and arts are being just as silly as the
occasional Carolingian I've encountered who thinks that a group
that doesn't do those arts is somehow incomplete. Both styles
are valid, and both are fun.

I agree with part of the point he is making in this posting, and
disagree with part. Criticizing other people in order to have
the pleasure of feeling self-righteous and proving they are
worse than you are is both discourteous and counter-productive.
But it does not follow that one should not have opinions of how
SCA ought to be done, and try to persuade others of them, which
is what the quoted passage seems to imply. There are many ways a
game can be played, but they are not all equally good, whether
"good" means "fun," "educational," or whatever. There are
reasons why almost nobody plays medieval chess any more--modern
chess turned out to be a more interesting game. Similarly, I am
willing to argue that a group that does nothing actually
medieval beyond putting on costumes is playing a less
interesting game than Carolingia is. Their way of dealing with
the Current Middle ages *is* "wrong," pace Justin du Coeur, not
because it is evil, or against the bylaws, but because it is
less interesting and less fun than other ways. My arguments and
my conclusions may well turn out to be wrong, but not because
all ways of dealing with the Current Middle Ages (or anything
else) are equally good. 

Tolerance as a spur to courtesy is a fine thing, but tolerance
as a technique for assuming away interesting issues is not.

Yours for courtesy and controversy

You ask:

1) Are we (Carolingia) really a bunch of stuffy
authenticity cops?
2) Is there such variation between groups that I would
encounter such problems
throughout the laurel kingdoms?
3) Does anybody else have a similar problem?
4) What do you do when the local role models say, "You
really shouldn't do that, it's not period," and the crown
gives you scrolls for the same behavior?

The society is a large, decentralized, voluntary
organization, and there is a wide range of opinions as to
the nature of the game we are playing. My own view is that
one should not do things at events that are obviously out
of period (songs about knights in mail going through metal
detectors), that things that only someone with specialized
knowledge would recognize as out of period (most Childe
Ballads, stories that really happened in the seventeenth
century, etc.) are acceptable, but things that are really
period (from period sources, or composed in such a way that
they could be from period sources) are better. One ought
not to make the best the enemy of the good--if sticking to
strictly period material means never singing another song,
it is better to keep singing. Never introduce an
out-of-period piece with an apology about being out of
period, since the apology is much more blatantly out of
period than the piece.

Remember also that in authenticity, as in other things,
there are trade-offs to be made. A song sung in old French
is more authentic in language than a translation, but less
authentic in the effect on the audience, since the original
audience was listening to a song in a language they understood.
1)Carolingia is more authentic than the average group. There is
nothing particularly stuffy about trying to be authentic--it can
be fun, and (in my opinion) a more interesting kind of fun than
getting an easy laugh by making twentieth century remarks while
wearing twelfth century clothes.
2)There is considerable variation in groups. Most groups regard
as acceptable blatantly out of period and out of persona
behavior--to the throne and from the throne in court, as well as
elsewhere. I prefer Carolingia.
3) Anyone who has a clear idea of what the Society should be
like has such a problem, because ideas on that subject vary
enough so that, whatever your view, there will be some good
people who honestly disagree with it.
4) You decide for yourself what the Society should be like, how
we ought to behave, and try to act accordingly, while doing your
best not to be discourteous to those who disagree.

Hoping this has been of some help, I remain

Your servant in service to the Society

Message-ID:  <8904202228.aa02157@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

In response to questions, I will attempt to be both brief and helpful on the
subject of Russian chainmail.

Book:  The State Armoury in the Moscow Kremlin, pub 1969 (if I have deciphered
the Russian correctly), edited by Zinaida Prokhorovna Chelyubeeva, (with the
help of 4 other editors and translators).  This copy is a discard of the Univ.
Of Baltimore Lib.

The shirt of flat chainmail is called "baidana".  The other shirt is a shirt
and vest combination called a 'bakhterets".  To me it looks like two pieces,
but the text implies that it is all one garment.  A number of pieces of chainmail
are shown with a vest of armour over them.  The bakhterets looks like Japanese
armour a little, and the text claims it was proof against firearms. A   14th
century helmet is also pictured, it has the spire typical of  Tartar arms and is
a very handsome piece.  It has a full aventail of conventionally made
chainmail.  The face plate has no eyeholes nor mouth hole.  It is a plain oval
of metal punched with many holes.  A friend of mine characterized it as  a
"oilcan with hockey mask attached".  It  my eye it is quite a handsome piece.

As for general tips about Russian garb: load it with pearls.  The tsars had
vast collections of precious gems to sew on their clothes, saddles, holsters,
carriages, you name it, and the passion for pearls was shared by anyone who
could afford it.  By the way, up until the late nineteenth century, pearls were
considered the most vauable gems.  When the diamond cartel was formed it
established a monopoly that inflated prices to approximately twice what market
forces would bear.  They maintain the monopoly by manipulating the buying and
selling of gems.  If you want a period jewelry from anywhere, pearls are your
choice.  

And just in case you were wondering, I have found the source for the
doorknocker in the movie " Labyrinth".  It's an excellent copy of a 17th
century Russian artillery officer's breastplate.  Only instead of a doorknocker
the lion is holding a spy glass in his mouth. The things you find when you
weren't looking!

	Good gentles of the Rialto, 

	I have a question that has bothered me for quite some time now, 
so I thought I should pose it to your esteemed company for discussion.
Our shire has occasionally debated the performance of bawdy songs at 
events, with the more prudish members of our group having the last word
most often.  At one event,  one of my household members sang an original
composition that was somewhat bawdy, much to the delight of everyone.
All was fine and good until the next shire meeting, when another gentle,
generally well-loved by all, took the floor and began to complain about 
the same song at grat length.  As a result of this, my dear sister has
refused to perform *anything* since, and the shire has unfortunately 
tacitly accepted this censorship.  I'd like to know firstly how you of 
the Net feel about the performance of bawdy songs at events, and secondly,
to hear any suggestions about a possible compromise.
	Just as an aside, it's probably apparent to you that I am not 
pleased with any type of censorship like this; my reaction is to say,
"Damn them all--perform what you will (if it be period)."  I do realize,
however, that this is probably a minority view, and that some compromise
is necessary; I would greatly appreciate any input.

I doubt that this is correct; judging by the number of pearls used in period
pieces, they were popular but less expensive than the most expensive
gemstones. CelliniUs comment on the subject (Treatises on Goldsmithing and
Sculpture, 16th century):

"But I have a thing or two to say in order not to scandalize a certain class
of men who call themselves jewellers, but may be better likened to hucksters
or linen-drapers, pawnbrokers, and grocers;... . So what I say is out of
respect to these dunderheads lest they should be shocked at my affirming that
the real stones are of four sorts only, and thus wag their arrogant tongues at
me & cry, 'How about the chrysoprase or ... and why the Devil wonUt you add
pearls, too, among the jewels, ainUt they fish bones?'"

A ruby, for instance, of five grains of wheat, & of as fine a fire as you
could wish, would be worth about 800 golden scudi, and an emerald of the same
.. 400, ...diamond ... 100, sapphire ... 10."

I have left out a good deal of CelliniUs badmouthing of the competition, but
it certainly sounds as though the ruby is the most expensive stone, next
emerald, then diamond, then sapphire, with pearls in, or perhaps below, the
class of semi-precious stones.

Checking further sources would be more work than I feel like going to at the
moment, but I am pretty sure that the increase in the popularity and price of
diamonds occurred long before the late 19th century. Casanova, for instance,
who is 18th century, frequently mentions them in a way that suggests they are
the most presigious gemstone. Modern sorts of diamond cutting, up to and
including the brilliant cut, develop, as I remember, starting in the late
sixteenth century, so I think the seventeenth century is when the diamond
becomes important.

So far as the diamond cartel is concerned, I am not sure how anyone could know
what the market price would be in its absence. The general question of just
what the De Beers cartel is and how it works is more complicated than
references to it usually suggest; from what I remember of an article on the
subject by (I think) Benjamin Klein at UCLA, De Beers does not control all
that large a fraction of production (perhaps a majority, but way under 100%).
What it does have a near monopoly on is marketing. This presents some obvious
problems, since if the price is being held way above market, producers should
want to produce more than De Beers is willing to sell, in which case you would
expect chiselling by the non-De Beers producers.  KleinUs explanation gets
into some interesting economics of information, and interprets De Beers not as
a cartel but as a natural monopoly on marketing.

I suppose that will be of interest to only a few of you, but I am an economist
by profession, and Awilda pushed one of my buttons.

Back to the subject of pearls. It is possible, although difficult, to get
"commercial grade" pearls, which are lower quality than what is normally sold.
They are relatively inexpensive (about twenty  dollars for a string of about 7
mm pearls, as I remember), real (although cultured), and probably closer to
what would be used in period than more expensive modern pearls. I got Patri
some a couple of years ago for a coronet he is going to finish real soon now.
I got them from a dealer at the Tucson gem and mineral show, which is
certainly the largest such in this country, possibly in the world. You might
be able to locate a source in New York, but I am not sure. They do permit you,
at a tolerable price, to use real pearls in your jewellery, and Awilda is
correct in saying that they were widely used in period.

On another subject, Donal Artur of the Silver Band asks about forks. Contrary
to popular SCA folklore, forks are used in period, including early period.
There is an early Byzantine fork in the Cleveland Museum of Art, and two
Anglo-Saxon fork and spoon sets in the British Museum. There is a pamphlet
from the Victoria and Albert that discusses the whole question of forks. I
think the earliest picture of people eating with them is something like
twelfth or thirteenth century. I believe early forks are not consistently two
tined, again contrary to SCA folklore.

What seems to be happening is that through most of period forks exist but are
not a standard eating implement. Think of them as equivalent to our fondue
forks--something occasionally used for special purposes. I believe they become
part of the standard table setting in England around the seventeenth century,
although I might be a little off. If it is important, I could check--all this
is from memory.

Subject: What about longships?
Message-ID: <890421225407.12.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

Greetings!

It would be interesting to know if there are any Viking longships in
the SCA or in the USA at large. I have a photo of a longship belonging
to the Kingdom of An Tir, but I hear that they have two ships both
built of fiberglass and powered by outboard motors - which is not quite
what I'm looking for.

There are a number of modern copies of historic ships that have been
built in Scandinavia. The Danish boy scouts have been particularly
active in this, and have several:
IMME AROS, copy of a 12th century merchant ship. This is a "knarr".
SEBBE ALS, copy of a small warship found at Skuldelev, Denmark. This is
  a long, narrow ship of a type that occurs on the Bayeux tapestry.
LENDHEIM SUNDS, another copy of the small warship but better built
  than Sebbe Als.
IMME SLEJPNER RODDING, a viking ship in style but not an exact copy
  of any existing period ship.
The Norwegians built a 2/3 scale copy of the Gokstad ship and sailed
it to the Isle of Man in around 1979. It seems the ship remains there,
and as far as I know there are no sailing copies in Norway now.

Swedish archaeologists built a copy of a Gotlandish viking-time merchant
  ship about five years ago, and sailed it through the USSR down to
  Constantinople. Just to prove how long it took and that it could be done.
There is also a full-size copy of a Viking ship in northern Sweden, all
  built with period tools (no electricity!). It has eight oars per side
  and is said to sail well, but I can't remember its name.
In Taby just north of Stockholm, there is also a viking ship copy. This
  one was built for a rich 19th century tycoon who used it for partying.
  It has five oars per side but is usually powered by an inboard motor.
  Looks very real though it's not quite authentic.

Does anyone on the net know of more longships, Viking or Norman?

Yours, William de Corbie

I believe the Henry of Maldon suggested election by a "Parliament" of
some sort.  This was done in the Middle Ages (Holy Roman Empire,
Poland), but it led to the Crown surrendering all power to the
electors to buy election.

A problem I forsee in the Modern Middle Ages is packing Parliament.
If it is a Royal perogative to create MPs (for example, if the peers
constitute Parliament), then one king could perpetuate a clique.

Whatever else may be said about choosing kings by combat, it's
relatively impartial and free of human judgement and bias (modulo
rhinohiding, alas).

About 6-month terms: I think they are a positive good.  True, I have
no idea who the Royalty of the Midrealm are, unless Talymar is
something now.  The only authority I know about are Baron Daemon and
Baroness Beryl de Folo -- but, hey, such ignorance is period.  8-)
A 6-month term limits the damage a king can do, and it allows many
to have the honor of holding the Crown.

Subject: homosexuals in the SCA

I would like to address this remark to the woman who felt uncomfortable
dressing in obviously feminine gowns, being addressed as "my lady", treated
deferentially, etc.  I am sure that you belong to the SCA because you enjoy
certain aspects of it.  However, I find it hard to understand why a woman would
join the SCA, a society based on romance and courtesy, if she did not want to
be treated in such a manner.  (Likewise for a man if he did not want to treat
women in such a manner.)

May I politely suggest that if the "normal" recreative activities of the SCA
make homosexuals uncomfortable, that it may not be the ideal social group for
them to join?

Subject: authenticity police
Message-ID:  <8904212254.aa12182@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

The authenticity police tend to be more in old groups than in the newer.  I
think the reason for this is because in old groups people (old people) have had
years to research, sew, practice, and generally upgrade their SCA equipment.
Not to mention, the older they get, the bigger their income.  This was  a real
problem for me when I joined.

I was a high school student, I had a long way to go to catch up to even an
impoverished college student.  With no income, no transportation, and few
research facilities ( I lived in the boondocks and commuted to SCA meetings) it
was hard.  It was also very frustrating to get sniffed at "THIS is the Way It
Should Be Done".  It was very depressing.  Basically, if you were a woman, you
had to be doing Tudors to get any appreciation.  If you were a man, you had to
be almost knighted.  Well, yes, Tudors are quite spectacular, but for me who
didn't even know how to sew, Viking was a practical solution.

I've seen people like the fellow who spent five hundred dollars on a
superb set of reproduction Japanese gauntlets.   And the Lady who blackworked
two very full sleeves solidly, and the fellow who built a gypsy wagon from scratch
and hauled it in on a flatbed trailer.  Wonderful!  But I don't have five
hundred dollars for gauntlets, I don't have time for yards of blackwork, and I
haven't got  a flatbed trailer!  Limitations of these sorts seem to escape the
authenticity police.

Right now I'm at work on a Russian costume.  Russian isn't my persona, but I've
been getting interested in it.  I like to try new things.  Since I'm out in the
boondocks agains, I'm winging it.  It's going to be very pretty, but I don't
know what shape headdresses women of this early period wore.  Did they even
wear headresses in the early 11th century?  All the resources I have availible
are later period.  So I'm guessing that they did, and I'm guessing that the
shape would be a simple, basic one.  First time I strut my stuff I'm sure I'm
going to meet somebody who tells me, "But they didn't use pearls that early!"
Well, phooey!  Pearls existed then, so they could have used them, and maybe 
it wasn't the social norm, and maybe I'm considered wierd by my contemporaries
for wearing a funny hat, but I LIKE IT, AND I DID THE BEST I COULD.

I do this part time as a hobby.  I have plenty of other things, more important
things like job and family that take precedence over the SCA.  I will do as
much as I can and still enjoy the SCA.  Some people who are more gung ho
than me will get to be  a lot more famous, but I don't care.  The stars
wouldn't shine unless there were lots of us ordinary folks around to compare
them to.  Unfortunately, the Authenticity Police come across as "If you can't
do it perfectly, you shouldn't bother doing it."

Some things, like no soda cans at feasts are simple.  Most of it takes work.
And we get there.  And we get there with helpful questions like, "I'd didn't
know they used pearls that early.  What are your sources?"  This is a much
friendlier way to go about educating the ignorant.  It conveys information
without denigrating effort.  Please encourage people who are daring  to try new
things!  Beginnings are delicate things, and people are easily discouraged into
abandoning projects.  We'd have a lot more Laurels if we passed out compliments
instead of criticism.

     Or alternately, what if a [hetero,homo]sexual (doesn't matter) female

    From: david@davids.UUCP  (David Herron)
    Subject: Plays
    I'm curious if anybody else on the Rialto is involved in putting on plays
    -- especially plays from period....

and I waited from someone else from Carolingia to answer, but no one did.
Well, here in Carolingia, we have The Baron's Own Troupe of Mummers, an
elaborate renaming of the former simply Mummers' Guild perpetrated several
years ago on the grounds (I believe) that any stationary band of players
would have been taken into the service/protection of the local noble if
possible to enhance the prestige of his court.  Or something like that.
    Anyway, I am not a member of the Troupe, so I comment as an outsider.
This is a loose guild, which increases in activity when a play is being
worked on, but seems fairly quiescent between productions.  The members are
anyone who acts in or otherwise helps with the plays, though some of them
seem to be a steady core while others vary in their attention to this
activity.  The Barony usually end up with a few plays a year, at various
events and of various lengths as autocrats request and directors wish.  We
have also had 3 or 4 events where (watching) the play was the main activity
-- usually with Shakespeare plays or something of similar length and
complexity.  I'm not sure what the sources are; I think the present
Guildmistress, Lady Caryl de Trecesson, has done a moderate amount of
research into period sources.  She isn't online, so I give her snailmail
address:
	Carol Hanson
	138 Lebanon St.
	Malden, MA 02148

Good luck with this attempt to provide entertainment; I don't recall ever
-not- liking a play I've seen at an SCA event.

Subject: 4 quick things.
Date: Wed, 19 Apr 89 17:28:22 PST


Friends of the SCA net, Tibor sends greetings:

4 quick things to respond to today:

1) Lord Justin du Coeur.  Hmmm, YESSSS!  Well done sir.

2) Just a thought about that tired same sex consort thing.  There
   is no requirement that the gender of a person and a personna match,
   is there?  So, one King, one Queen, no problems.  Comments?

3) William de Corbie, just being gay does not make someone espouse
   homosexuality.

4) In reference to Lord Li Kung Lo's new Troubador.  First congratulations.
   now:

I should explain.  I am in Trimaris, but also a Carolingian ("Carolingia
status mentis est")  I have spent many hours with Ritchie and Li Kung Lo
(same guy).  Ritchie, you are a great performer.  At events, post revels
or with you amplifier, you are fun to listen to.  You DESERVE recognition,
and if that is a Order of the Troubador, good.  Don't let small minds
and whiny voices get you down.

Yes, we Carolingians are stuffy authenticity cops.  This is good, and
could be better.  A lofty goal of authenticity is good, and good
teachers are better.  What Carolingians are not gifted at is sharing
the abilities of their more gifted members in a fashion which makes
everyone feel better.  A large part of this is the micro society
which Carolingia is.  I often feel that everyone there is so much
better than I that I try too hard.  But to those of you who have
only heard of Carolingian Authenticity Imperialism:  you should know
that the best friends, kindest hearts, most gifted artisans and
scholars and best times can be found there.  Wherever I am, or
go, no matter how poorly I dance, sing, stitch or cook, I love
Carolingia.  Ritchie (and others with A-police worries) remember
that we love the events we go to because people like you are there
and make us happier.  I am proud of all of my brothers and sisters,
since you all make this true.
  
Trimaris seems to be much less interested in authenticity as a vice,
and very appreciative of it as an accomplishment.  I hear more of
"I wish I were that good" than "I wish they were better".  Nice,
eh?

As too "What if the local role models say no, and the Crown says
good job?".  Why, do what makes you happy.  And I know it makes you
happy to sing.  Folks, make him sing?  He is soooo good!  (Thanks
for the check, Lord Li :-}).

Subject: mead recipe

I found a version of my mead recipe without formatting instructions on
a machine that is being scrapped soon.  Here it is for those who
requested it:

				Mead
		 (a fermented drink made from honey)
			   Generic Recipe

The basic ingredients of mead are honey, water, and yeast.  The
proportions of the honey and water determine the final strength and
sweetness of the drink, also how long it takes to make.  The ratio
ranges from 1 lb.  honey per gallon of water for a very light
"soft-drink" to 5 lbs.  per gallon for a sweet dessert wine.  The less
honey, the lighter the mead, and the quicker it can be made.  I've
successfully made a 1 lb/gallon mead in as little as three weeks, while
my strongest mead (5 lb/gallon) was not bottled for six months, and
could have stood another few months before bottling.  Elizabethan
recipes varied considerably in strength, but 3 or 4 pounds of honey per
gallon was common.

The mead I make is spiced, so is sometimes referred to as "metheglin."
Elizabethan meads used large numbers of different spices and herbs, but
not always in large quantities.  Kenelm Digby, after giving the recipe
obtained from "Master Webbe, who maketh the Kings Meathe," has this to
say:

   The Proportion of Herbs and Spices is this; That there be so
   much as to drown the luscious sweetness of the Honey; but not so
   much as to taste of herbs or spice, when you drink the Meathe.
   But that the sweetness of the honey may kill their taste: And so
   the Meathe have a pleasant taste, but not of herbs, nor spice,
   nor honey.  And therefore you put more or less according to the
   time you will drink it in.  For a great deal will be mellowed
   away in a year, that would be ungratefully strong in three
   months.  And the honey that will make it keep a year or two,
   will require a triple propotion of spice and herbs.

[The Closet of the Eminently Learned Sir Kenelm Digby Knight Opened,
1669]

Here is a partial list of flavoring agents (mainly  herbs and spices)
mentioned for meads by Digby: agrimony, angelica root, avens, baulme
leaves, bay leaves, bettony, blew-button, borrage, cinnamon,
clove-gilly flowers, cloves, dock, eglantine, elecampane, eringo roots,
fennel, fruit juice (cherries, raspes, Morrello cherries), ginger,
harts-tongue, hopps, juniper berries, limon-pill, liver-worth, mace,
minth, nutmeg, orris root, parsley roots, raisins, red sage, rosemary,
saxifrage, scabious, sorrel, strawberry leaves, sweet marjoram,
sweet-briar leaves, thyme, violet leaves, wild marjoram, wild sage,
wild thyme, and winter savory.

In my own brewing, I use mainly "sweet" spices (cinnamon, ginger,
nutmeg).  The main herb I use is tea.  Tea is an important addition to
the mead.  It provides tannic acid, to give the drink a bit of bite.
It is particularly important for sweet meads, which can otherwise have
a rather syrupy taste (like Mogen David wines).  Any sort of tea will
do--I've used genmai cha (a very light Japanese green tea), lapsang
souchong (a smokey Chinese tea), China Rose (a black tea with rose
petals), jasmine, oolong, and others.  If you want to use Lipton's,
that should work as well.

Other ingredients I use include small amounts of  orange or lemon
juice, fruit, cloves, and other spices. I've used bay leaves, cloves,
rosemary, anise, and galingale, in addition to the spices listed above.
Be careful not to over-spice the mead!  It is probably safer to use
less of fewer spices, until you've had some experience.

As examples, here are the quantities for two of my mead batches:

------------------------------------------------------------

I use tap water for brewing, but if your tap water has off-flavors,
then you might want to get a bottle of clear spring water.

The honey may be almost any cheap honey. Strongly flavored honeys
(orange blossom, buckwheat, wild flower (in some areas)) generally work
best. Clover honey works well, but very light honeys (like alfalfa)
generally lack flavor.  If making a true mead (without spices), the
flavor of the honey is more important, and only strongly flavored
honeys should be used.

The yeast is important. Baking yeast is bred for fast carbon dioxide
production, and is not at all suitable for brewing. Some home cider
makers may be used to just letting the sweet cider stand a few days to
ferment on its own.  This technique relies on the wild yeasts present
in the air, on the cider press, and on the skins of the apples.  It
doesn't work for mead.  The wild yeasts result in off-flavors, which
the honey is not strong enough to mask. For strong, still meads (3 lbs
honey/gallon or more) I use a white wine yeast, while for a lighter
beverage I use ale yeast.  A beer yeast should work as well as an ale
yeast, but I find top-fermenting ale yeasts more fun to work with.
WARNING: the "brewer's yeast" sold in health-food stores is dead yeast,
it will not be usable for brewing.

The equipment you need is a large pot (I use a 20 quart canning pot), a
5 foot plastic tube to use as a siphon, and strong bottles.  In
addition, a 5 gallon water bottle with a stopper and fermentation lock
is a very useful piece of equipment.  Everything you use should be
sterilized to prevent the growth of vinegar-forming bacteria.  There
are chemical sterilizing agents available from wine-making supply
stores, but I prefer to sterilize everything in boling water.  I'll
mention sterilizing over and over.  It is the single most important
part of brewing mead rather than vinegar.

If making a still, wine-type mead, any sort of bottle will do for the
final bottling.  However, this recipe is for a fizzy "ale-type" mead,
so strong bottles are essential.  Champagne bottles and returnable pop
bottles are usable, disposable bottles of any sort are not.  I once had
an apple juice bottle explode in my room, embedding shrapnel in my
pillow from 9 feet away.  Don't make the same mistake--use strong
bottles!!

Steps to making the mead:

1. Boil the water, adding the tea and spices.

2. Remove water from heat and stir in honey.  (Note, stirring implement
should be sterilized!)  Some mead brewers boil the honey in the water,
skimming the scum as it forms.  This removes some of the proteins from
the honey, making it easier for the mead to clarify.  However, I don't
mind a bit of cloudiness, and prefer the taste of unboiled honey.  If
you're buying a clear honey from a supermarket, it may already have
been cooked a bit to remove pollen and sugar crystals, in which case, a
bit more cooking probably won't change the flavor much.  Digby's
recipes do call for boiling the honey.

3. Cover the boiled water, and set it aside to cool (to blood
temperature or cooler).  This usually takes a long time, so I overlap
it with the next step.

4. Make a yeast starter solution by boiling a cup of water and a
tablespoon of honey (or sugar).  Let it cool to blood heat (or all the
way to room temperature) and add the yeast.  Cover it and let it
ferment overnight.  The yeast should form a "bloom" on the surface of
the liquid.  (Of course, the cooling and fermenting should be done in
the pan or other sterilized vessel.)

5.  Add the yeast starter to the cooled liquid.  Cover and let ferment.
After a few days, it is useful to siphon the mead into another
container, leaving the sediment behind.  Here's where the 5 gallon
bottle comes in handy.  A fermentation lock provides a way to close the
bottle so carbon dioxide can get out, but vinegar-forming bacteria and
oxygen cannot get in. Remember to sterilize the bottle and the siphon
first!

6. Ferment for a few weeks in a warm, dry place.  When a lot of
sediment has collected on the bottom of the bottle, siphon off the
liquid (without disturbing the sediment). This process is known as
"racking," and helps produce a clear, sediment-free mead.  Again, make
sure all your equipment is sterilized.

7. For a fizzy mead, siphon into strong (sterilized) bottles a bit
before fermentation stops.  With the strength given here 4 weeks is
about right.  The exact time depends a lot on the temperature, the
yeast, the honey, ... .  I use plastic champagne corks to seal the
bottles (sterilized, of course!).  Crown caps are also good.  Real
corks should only be used for still beverages, since the amount of
carbonation is unpredictable.  Too much carbonation and you'll pop the
corks, too little, and corks are hard to remove from champagne bottles.
Don't wire on the corks, unless you're willing to risk an occasional
broken champagne bottle.  Still meads should not be bottled until
fermentation has completely stopped. I generally wait until the
fermentation has stopped, and the mead has cleared. This can take more
than six months for a strong wine mead.

8. Age the mead in a cool place.  Note: ferment warm, and age cool.  I
sometimes keep the champagne bottles upright in the cardboard box they
came in.  That way, if a cork pops, there is something to absorb the
overflow, and if, despite my care, a bottle breaks, it won't set off a
chain reaction.

9. Drink and Enjoy! The light quick meads should be served chilled
(like beer), while the wine types are better at room temperature or
only slightly chilled.

Subject: Rolls, Rialto, and Reputations

Time to toss out a few comments:

First off, the Rolls Ethereal are (finally) done and in Danulf's hands. As soon
as he figures out how to get a 50+K file out to the list without killing
things, it will go out. My apologies for how late this is; I dramatically
underestimated the amount of time that it would take to do the data entry.
The new Rolls are almost twice the size of the last edition, so be ready for
it...

Second, it appears that the discussions here are having some real effects.
At both EK Coronation and the Carolingian Quest to Save Appledor this past
weekend, when scrolls were presented, they were greeted with a little hum
of approval, but a very conspicuous *lack* of "ooo, ahhh, ohhh" (instead,
there was a two-second pause, in which one could hear the entire Peanut
Gallery thinking, "oh, right, that's rude"). At least out East, people do
seem to be taking the thoughts of the Rialto to heart...

Lastly, I don't think that Carolingia's reputation is really all *that*
bad -- we seem to just suffer from a problem fairly common in the Society,
as it is in any group as large and unstructured as ours. There is a 
tendency for people to think that the way that they do things is the "right"
way to do them. The Society is a diverse enough organization to support a
*lot* of variety, and people just don't always realize that.

For example, one friend of mine moved here from the West some years ago,
determined to "show the Easterners how it's done". After living in
Carolingia for three years, he moved back West, and did *exactly* the
same thing in the other direction, deciding that the West had to educated
in the Carolingian Way of Doing Things, missing the point entirely.

There is *no* right or wrong way of dealing with the Current Middle Ages,
but there are different ways. People who think that Carolingia must be
stuffy because of its emphasis on authenticity (which isn't really all
that much stronger than in most places I've seen) and arts are being just
as silly as the occasional Carolingian I've encountered who thinks that
a group that doesn't do those arts is somehow incomplete. Both styles
are valid, and both are fun. Let's face it: an SCA group that isn't fun
isn't going to survive very long, since it won't get new members. 

Yes, there are people who don't understand this; there are probably some
people who will never understand this. Denigrating and/or converting the
heathen is some peoples' favorite pastime, and there are some people who
will never understand that "different" doesn't mean "worse". But there
aren't a heck of a lot of them; I've run into less than half-a-dozen people
who actually believed in Carolingia's reputation in my six years with the
Society. Frankly, that's fewer than the number of Carolingians I've hit who
deserved that reputation. In short, don't sweat it; there will always be
twits around, but, so long as the reputation they spread isn't really
justified, most people aren't going to listen to them.

Hey folks, has any one noticed the subtle effect we are having on the Society?
A discussion was started a few months ago about the percieved insult in going
"ooh, aah, ohh!" when a scroll is presented in court.  At a local event last
weekend, 3 lovely scrolls were presented.  While there was a noticable drawing
of breaths and some applause, the synchronized "ooh, aah, ohh!" conspicuosly
failed to happen.  This was reportedly also the case at EK coronation that
weekend.  The ideas and attitudes promulgated on this net are apparently
spreading faster than any one realized...  Has anyone noticed similar sudden
changes which were apparently the result of the Rialto?

[Lady-in-Waiting hat time again.]

While His Majesty King Eirik was thoroughly enjoying himself at Estrella
War last month, he lost his rather large (no, scratch that) VERY large
clear glass drinking goblet. He came home with someone else's cup that is
rather similar in appearance but does not have the sentimental value that
the original cup had. (Y'see, it was at this beer-drinking contest that he
attended with the Queen ... - sorry, I've forgotten her name - and he was
having so much fun...)

Does anyone who attended Estrella War have any ideas where we can go to try
and recover the lost (omygosh! - it's a Grail!) goblet?

Subject: Comment on Period Music at Events

In SCA Digest #310, Eliane Esperance Sans Asile says: (paraphrased)
that hearing modern folk music at events saddens her and compares it to
someone attending an event in tie-die garb.

I would respectfully suggest that true period music is an acquired taste,
similar to that of say, true period food. You can taste/tolerate samples of
both on a periodic basis, but for full enjoyment, you'd prefer something
with which you are more familiar.

Folk/Filk songs are easier to enjoy because we understand the language and
can hum along. It comes to us from our childhood and from our radios. It is
what we know. Period music requires interest and dedication to be enjoyed.

As it happens, I was developing an interest in classical music just before
I joined the SCA. But it's only recently (5+ years later) that I've started
to actively seek out recordings of SCA-period medieval music. It's taken me
that long to develop my classical taste to the point where I enjoy period
music done on period instruments. (That's "enjoy" as in putting it on while
I cook dinner - seeking it out - as opposed to "enjoying" a presentation
at court - being vaguely interested.)

I'm sorry you find Folk/Filk music disrupts your enjoyment at events. It
seems to me that you are in the same situation as a Master Armourer who
sees hockey gloves, carpet armour and pickle-barrel plate on the field.

Perhaps it would help to remember that while the folk songs we sing are
perhaps not period, folk songs as a genre are. And while I also cringe
at the sound of a filk to, say "White Christmas", the concept of filking
is *very* period.

> Even when the live musicians were not up to snuff, someone once brought

Yes, please! (Actually, this isn't a bad idea for "educating the masses".
Play true period music while only their subconsious is listening...)

M'lord, Kobayashi, I heartily sympathize.

I spent my first 4 years or so in the Society in the Barony of the
Cleftlands in the Midrealm, another old, large group with a strong core
of people, which has developed a strange reputation over the years.

After I moved away, I started hearing all of these stories about how
Cleftlanders were snobs and so on.  In a way this is at least partially
true, since members of the Barony are rightfully proud of what they've
built.  However, one of the other characteristics of the members of
the Barony that I have noticed is the willingness to talk with anyone
for as long as they're willing to hang around, and an intolerance for
people who aren't willing to consider alternate points of view or
the lessons of history (of which there are actually a few in the SCA).

Then, though, I started hearing tales about The Evil Baron and Baroness,
who were plotting the Destruction of The Society As We Know It (mainly
because they tend to be skeptical of Great New Ways To Solve All Our
Problems...), would like to see all heralds roasted slowly over a fire,
and so on.

The descriptions I heard bear no real resemblance to the people I know,
which puzzled me to no end.  Then I started hearing similar tales about
Carolingia (which I must admit made me think that it must be a fairly
nice place to be :-)), Northwoods, Bhakail, and other older groups, and
I started to sense a pattern.  It was when I started hearing similar
sorts of things about the Midrealm as a whole from people in younger
kingdoms (complaints about an invitational Crown Lists, for example),
that it occurred to me that the Society is new to an awful lot of
people, and that they tend to think of it as a lot more mutable than
it really is.  Soon we will be celebrating the Argent Anniversary.
Cleftlands will soon be celebrating its Twentieth (if I've got my dates
right :-)).  This is a lot of time, folks, and if some of us sometimes
come across as snobbish by getting irritated by Coke cans or SF filk
songs at events, it's not because we don't like them (often quite
the opposite, in fact), but because we have learned from experience
how much of a difference can be made by paying attention to these kinds
of little details.  Pouring Coke into a goblet is simple, and helps
preserve the atmosphere (note: avoid using marble goblets for this--I
tried it once and discovered that Coke has enough phosphoric acid in it
to etch soft stone...).  These "little" things are part of preserving
the atmosphere at an event, as much as wearing garb instead of a T-shirt
and jeans, even if the garb is just a T-tunic and belt.

Paying attention to this sort of thing also opens you up to any number
of little bits of medieval life that can themselves make even more of
a difference--things like salt cellars, oil lamps, and so on.

Everyone was new at one time, and everyone runs into people with more
of an authenticity fetish than they do themselves, but one thing to
remember is that, like most things, reputations have more than one side,
and the accuracy of the stories that tend to circulate about people and
groups often depends a lot on your point of view.

The East Kingdom also made a triple peer at the first court of Morghun and
Maurya.  I believe that this is the first, if not it is one of the few.  I
thought some of the folks out west might be interested to hear this, since
it was Viscount Master Master Sir Edward Zifron, Lord Gendy, Baron of the
Eastern Court (aka Fast Eddy).  (Actually that's 4 peerages, isn't it.)  I
wish I could have seen his face, but I had cut out for a snooze and missed
it. His comment later: "I guess I need a new hobby now. Maybe I'll take up

Subject: Thanks from the reluctant Croissant

Unto the good folk of the Rialto, many thanks from Lady Ariel of Caer
Myrddin, who can now come out from under the table.

To everyone who responded to my plea for help and advice, thanks and thanks
again!  I received a number of helpful responses, both public (in the Digest)
and private, and I am grateful to all of you.  Special thanks go to Hal Ravn,
Li Kung Lo, Catrin gan Mor Rhys, Arval, and Arnoff for doing my heart good.

And you know -- something may have clicked!  I attended East Kingdom Coronation
this past weekend, and a number of people extended their congratulations and
condolences at the same time.  I also note that it was the first event I'd been
to since I got the Croissant that I wasn't attacked by the "gimme" lobbyists.
Maybe the Rialto has performed another service: it made people think.  Anything
that can do that is valuable indeed.

On alternate personae: Sometimes it works; sometimes it doesn't.  Every once
in a while I like to wear Japanese or Italian Renaissance (kind of a departure
from my usual Celtic stuff).  My friends usually see me and think of me as
"Ariel in a kimono" rather than bothering with my Japanese persona -- and I
find I have trouble responding when yet another of my names is called.  I kind
of believe that the persona ought to match the accessories, but in practice it
just doesn't work for me, so I guess I'll really always be Ariel in a kimono.

Arval: Is a mon considered a badge or a device?  Are there special rules for
designing and registering mon?

Thanks again, all of you.

At Trimarian Art/Sci competitions, we occasionally have problems finding

I dabble in costuming and other textile-type arts.  I have in the past had
to judge leatherwork categories `cuz there wasn't anyone else there who
had the knowledge of the category or who wasn't on a permanent lunch break.
In cases like this one, photocopies of your documentation are a god-send!!!
Even if the judges don't know a thing about what you've done, They have
something to refer to.  I photocopy as much as I can for my documentation
as I know that even though the gentles judging my lace work probably have a

Y'know, that's the best solution I've heard yet.  Regardless of your
feelings about homosexuality, within the confines of the SCAdian
society, we should be dealing with the PERSONAs, and if someone is
running a female persona (regardless of their gender OUTSIDE the

Subject: Into the Breach! (Apologia pro Carolingia)

Sigh.  Here we go.  This is *very* long, but Lord Li Kung Lo has
touched a subject near and dear to my heart, and i cannot, nay
*must* not be silent.  The opportunity for stirring things up is
impossible for me to resist.

I am going to try to pre-empt some of the potential mail on this
subject, and will no doubt generate more (but different) mail as
a result.  Isn't progress wonderful?  I have cataloged the Carolingian
Myths that *i* know about, as a sort of framework for the Carolingia-
bashing that is no doubt about to happen.

MYTH #1: Carolingians are snobs.

Carolingians have this problem.  We are members of one of the oldest
active groups in the Known World.  We have had reputations of various
sorts longer than many groups have even *existed*.  And we are now
in what i believe to be a no-win situation.

The reputation of Carolingians (for the two or three of you out there
who haven't heard) is that of Authenticity Police.  That is, we
Disapprove of things that Aren't Period, and do so intrusively.
We disapprove of zippers.  We disapprove of Coke cans on
feast tables.  We disapprove of forks.  We disapprove of badly-
reconstructed dances, or folk songs at revels, or any of a large
number of things.  Above all, and the main source of complaint, is
that we don't approve of having fun.

Doesn't this sound unpleasant?  What sort of tight-lipped, piggy-
eyed curmudgeons we must all be.  How could such a group exist?
Why would anyone *join* such a group?  How could these people
continue, year after year, to attract new, talented individuals?
Why hasn't the group faded into obscurity?

Unfortunately, a reputation like this is almost impossible to get
rid of.  If even *one* person who identifies him/herself as
Carolingian offends *one* person from out-Barony, our sorry
reputation is secure for another year at least.  It doesn't matter
if ten or twenty Carolingians are nice to people, because no one
ever gossips about *nice* things that people do.

So what happens?  I go to an event, and see a Coke can on the table.
It annoys me.  I have two choices: 1) ignore it and be annoyed in
silence, or 2) say something about it.  Either way, i lose.  If i
don't say anything, the stupid Coke can sits there for the whole
feast, intruding on my very personal enjoyment of the feast.  If i
say something, another Carolingian Snob has reared up to quash
Someone Else's Fun.  No one *else* will say anything about the can,
lest they be branded a Carolingian Sympathizer, which fate is worse
than death.  And yet all i am doing is requesting that things be
made more medieval in a very do-able manner.

For those of you who think i am overstating our importance, i only
wish that it were so.  I have met people from many Kingdoms, and
the reaction is always, "Gee, but you don't *act* like a Carolingian."
I've given up worrying about it, because as far as i can tell, there
is nothing i can do.

Now having said all that, i must now backtrack and admit that, to
a large extent, the reputation has been deserved at various times
in the past.  Being a large and largely self-sufficient group, we
have grown insular and clique-ish (though a clique of 100 is something
of a contradiction in terms).  Many newcomers (and this includes
both new-to-SCA and new-to-Barony) have been put off by us in the
past.  This is regrettable both for the loss of a potential friend
and the additional damage it did to our reputation.

MYTH #2: Carolingians don't travel.

There is a basis for this myth as well.  Being a large group, we can
put on successful (read: non-money-losing) events that draw only on
the local population.  Furthermore, our potential supply of turk--
uh, autocrats is large enough that we could put on an event a month,
and have done so in the past, to the great annoyance of our neighbors.

Now, if you only wanted to go to one SCA event a month, and had a
choice between taking the bus or driving for four hours, which would
you choose?  Suppose you are a full-time university student (read
"poor")?

Now we add the reputation from Myth #1, and even if people do travel
they are reluctant to admit they are Carolingian!  Furthermore, if
someone is a transplant from, say, Myrkfaellin, or one of the other
"fun" groups, that person is thought of as a Myrky, not as a
Carolingian, even after man years.  And even when a dyed-in-the-wool
Carolingian such as myself travels, people just decide that i am not
"typical", since i am presentable in public places.  Sheesh!

MYTH #3: Carolingia serves bad feasts.

This is the only one that disturbs me, because i know it just isn't
true.  The only thing i can conclude is that someone happen to hit
one or two bad feasts (everyone makes mistakes), spread the word,
and everyone believed it because we were wierd anyway.  I would really
like to squash this one, because it reflects badly on a very talented
set of cooks here, and may, for all i know, be standing in the way
of awards for them.

So, CAROLINGIA COOKS YUMMY FEASTS!

This is already too long, and i'd like to hear what people have to
say.  Let me say again that i acknowlege past transgressions, and do
not mean to excuse them.  My main interest is in what, if anything,
i can do to have our reputation more accurately reflect our actuality.

Yours for the impossible task of changing one's own reputation, i am,

Subject:  Period Music at Events


Unto the folk of the Rialto, I send greeting.  In response to Lord
Li Kung Lo's missive, I'm afraid I have rather a lot to say.  I am a
mundane musician who spends a lot of time doing research on period
music, history, practice, paleography, etc ad nauseum.  I like the
stuff.  So does my persona, it's all she knows.  When I hear modern
folk music demanded and played, then rewarded at events it saddens me.
I know too many musicians who try VERY HARD to learn and perform
period stuff, and even write period songs, who go unrecognized.  As
a musician, part of the Dream for me is music.  Hearing filk played
at an event is as jarring as seeing someone attend an event in tie-die,
haveing obviously made no attempt to even look vaguely period.  What is
worse, at least for me, is that the people at the event where my lord
Li Kung Lo played seemed to prefer the modern stuff.  At the same event,
I offered to play recorder for the dancing, but the dancers prefered
the tape player, even though it only played one refrain.  (Yes, I can
play up to a dancers tempo)
I do not find Carolingia the least bit stuffy in regards to music.
What I found when I lived there was a group of people who shared my
love for period music, and who tried to learn and perform this at events.
Even when the live musicians were not up to snuff, someone once brought
tape of medieval "dinner music" to play during the feast.  The
atmosphere improved remarkably for all attending, especially for me.
It's not really a matter of being stuffy, it's a matter of just how
hard we are trying to recreate the Middle Ages.  We eat with knives
at events, we refuse to sew zippers into our clothes, we cook period
food, we use period manners (at least at court), why should music be
any different from any of these other arts?
I love Lord Li Kung Lo's songs, but i prefer to hear them in a more
modern context, say at post revels.  It is not hard to refrain from
modern tastes for a little while, trust me.

I believe the photocopy reprint referred to is the collection
of source material on period cooking that I and Diana compiled
many years ago and that I have been selling, with additions,
ever since. At least one edition was done by societa
Illuminata in Carolingia, and we have often had the copying
done there, since they have inexpensive xeroxing. It contains
Kenelm Digby and many other things-about 1200 pages total,
reduction xeroxed four pages to one (i.e. 150 sheets of paper,
printed on both sides, making 300 sides x 4 pages/side). It is
available from me for $15 (find me at war or events); if anyone
needs it immediately I will sell by mail, but prefer not to
since I am not very well organized. There is a second volume
consisting mostly of translations done by SCA people; it is
currently over 200 pages and sells for $7. If you do order things
by mail add postage.

Incidentally, if anyone is interested in translating cookbooks,
let me know. We currently have German and Italian books 
in search of translators.

For those who are interested in being as nearly period as 
possible, note that tea is pretty clearly not available in
europe until after 1600 and is not, to the best of my 
knowledge, mentioned by Digby. My guess is that its use in
mead is a 19th or 20th century innovation; as I remember, it 
is not mentioned in the article on mead in the first edition of
the Britannica.

Oops. My Lady Wife points out that Digby does mention tea, although
not as a mead additive. Page 132.

Subject: Drunkards and Lovers

Greetings my friends!

    I find that I can no longer refrain joining 
the debate over same sex royalty after my lord William  de Corbie's
latest posted comments...
1.There have been many references to "openly homosexual couples",
as if lewdness were the sole property of the gay community.Personally
I find public lewd behavior distasteful no matter what the gender
combinations involved. And I submit that we are no more likely to witness
a royal display of this if the king and queen are of the same sex.
If ,by "openly homosexual couples ", you mean that they simply exist,
and live, then I'm afraid I have no answer to YOUR problem.

2.You compare in the same breath  a drunkard to a lover.Few drunks
 are ever sorry for there problem , and in fact drunks love
company in their sorry state.To compare someone who is in love 
to a drunk or a thief is outrageous.Are you not missing the
substance for the form?I  think that Love is where you find it , 
it you are lucky enough to find it at all.

Subject: Russian chainmail
Message-ID:  <8904181008.aa08341@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

A friend of mine recently bought a book called "The State Armoury in the
Moscow Kremlin".  It has photographs and text of many historical artefacts in
the Armoury, a building that formerly housed the steel workshops of the Tsars.
It now contains the treasures of all the workshops, gold and silver, textiles,
carriages, horse rfurniture, you name it, whatever was necessary for the
magnificence of the Tsar and his family.  Most of the objects date from the
16-17th centuries, but pieces cover the range from 5-18th centuries.
Unfortunately for armourers, the book concentrates on religious objects,
textiles, and carriages.  It does have a few pictures of armour, including the
chainmail stylke with which we are all familiar, but including also photos of
two different pieces, the like of which I have never seen before.  Well, I am
not an armourer, so maybe what I have to describe is not news to those more
involved than myself, but I  thought the Rialto would like to know.

The two pieces date from the middle of the sixteenth century.  They are made
with flat rings that have a word  stamped on one side.  The ring look a little
like washers, and it is apparent to me that they were cast in molds.  This
seems like a very fast way to get rings to me.  

The second thing differnt about them is that they were knit in the round.  A
metal wire going around the throat is the starting point.  The armour is built
up in concentric circles gradually getting bigger until the circle thus made
reaches the armpit.  It is then divided into three tubes: one large for the
body, two amall for the arms.  Additional stitches are put in at the armpits to
get the necessary fullness, and these additions make a clearly raglan sleeves.
Interestingly enough, the first rounds were done with what in testile knitting
we call an "invisible" increase.  Therefore there is a seam running from the
underarm part way up, and then stopping.   The coat of mail is also slit in the
from, like a tunic.  Whatever closures were used to fasten it shut are now
lost, but the pieces are in superb condition otherwise.

I have not finished reading the text, so I have no more information than what I
could observe from the pictures, but if I learn anything additional, I shall be
happy to post it.

Subject: Fealty to the Crown
Message-ID:  <8904181051.aa09878@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

Milord William,

I disagree with you (don't I always? :-) about the oath of fealty.  The oath is
not to the man, but to the Crown.  The man is only a man, doing the best he
can, even if that best isn't very good.  All of us are flawed, no one agrees
with us perfectly, there is consensus about very few matters. We all agree that
chilvalry is one of our ideals, yet witness the debate we had on the Rialto
about what constitutes chivalry on the battlefield.  The  Crown is the symbol
of a set of medeival virtues we ascribe to, but cannot agree on the defintion
of.  To wit, courage, integrity, loyalty, courtesy, chivalry, generosity,
skill, knowledge, and  hospitality.  

We specifically DO NOT include highly personal matters such as religion and sex
among the virtues of the Crown.  Sex is completely irrelevant to the Crown.  It
doesn't matter whether the king is gay or straight, virgin or promiscuous,
virile or impotent, we do not perpetuate dynasties, and family connections have
nothing to do with our choice of Sovereign.  I grant that this is very
unperiod, but I think all of us agree that we do not want any part of the
tyrany of kings.

Since sex is not among the duties of the Crown, sex is in no way relevant to
choosing the Sovereign, nor does the sovereign's sexual behaviour have any
relevancy to the SCA.  The mere fact that someone who is gay happens to be
serving as king does not means that by swearing fealty to him you are condoning
a sexual practice you disaprove of. You are swearing fealty to the Crown, and
the Crown has no sex.  In this way it is also possible to swear fealty to a
king who is a rhinohide, a drunk, a wife beater, drug user, a theif, or
anything else you disapprove of.  The Crown is none of these things. It is
impossible for a mere human being to besmirch the Crown, it is the shining
ideal of which we are all poor reflections.

The only reason I can see refusing fealty to the Crown is when the Sovereign
wearing has committed treason.  That is to say, when the Sovereign has acted to
deliberately damage the SCA.  I can think of only one king who has done that,
and that was Michael, know variously as the Abominable, or Black Michael.  His
goings on were sufficient to require recourse to a mundane court of law.

And now to close witha  quote from "The Burden of the Crown" by Baldwin of
Erebor,

"This cap of burnished metal is the symbol of a the land,
 Supporting all we cherish, the dreams for which we stand.
The weight you'll find is nothing when you hold it in your palm,
The burden of the Crown begins the day you put it on."

	I think we have another European-American cognitive dissonance
going here -- m'lord de Corbie, being a European (and a subject of the
King of Sweden in his 20th Century life) obvioulsy takes kingship and
oaths of fealty seriously.
	Americans, on the other hand, having given Mad George the boot in
the 1770s-80s, take kings much less seriously.  Oaths of fealty are a bit
on the funny side, too . . .

	On the other hand, oaths of all sorts were freely taken and
freely dropped in period -- a good deal of fulminations and ranting is
still extant on the perfidity of vassals in general in not living up to
the oaths they have sworn to their overlords.  The general American
attitude is thus closer to being in period.
	Americans are (or used to be) also master pragmatists -- more
concerned with getting things done than with the niceties of lthe
intellectual justifications for them.  There is an old joke about a group
of Englishmen, a group of Frenchmen and a group of Americans who were all
washed up on an island -- after 6 weeks, the English had sorted out who
randked whom socially, the French had determined who had the greatest
powers of intellect and the most prestigious degree, and the Americans
had built a boat and left.

	Intellectuals take words and forms tremendously seriously,
pragmatists make 'em up as they go along . . .

I thought this discussion was about the "feasabilty" of consorts of
the same sex.  Although "sexual preference" started this discussion
the ACTUALLY (or imagined) sexual preference of the the people
involved shouldn't matter.  i.e. (given the possibilty of same sex
consorts) the sexes of the ruling couple shouldn't imply in any way
that they are having a relationship, any more than it does now.

Subject: Oh No, King Bill!

Unto the fair folk of the Rialto Li Kung Lo sends greetings! My present
confusion comes not so much in the form of a problem as a conflict in local
practice. For a very long time I was a mundane singer/guitarist, and though I
do not try to make a living of it any more, I do still love to perform. I know
frighteningly little about period music, having written one song which has a
clear medieval theme, and collaborated on another. I also am learning some
modern Scottish/Irish ballads for fun.
        Certain individuals who are taken with my songs (which has included at
least four sets of royalty) have caused me to sing at feasts, and rewarded me
for my performances. This culminated at recent coronation where I was inducted
by the crown of the East into the Order of the Troubador, the EK award for
bardic arts. This is gratifying in its own odd way, of course. All of my other
awards are for service, and although I have labored long and hard on a variety
of tasks, particularly sewing/costuming, which did not come easily to me, the
OT is the only award I have ever received for doing something artsy.
        After my arm was twisted by a pelican who shall remain unamed into
playing my songs before the crown, I suggested that in Carolingia I would be
strongly criticized for performing them at a feast, because they really aren't
period. The crowned head in attendance, who shall also remain unamed replied,
"That's all right, I'm not stuffy."
        The obvious solution is to write some wonderful ballads with period
voice leading, melody, and ornamentation, but that may take some time. In the
mean time, I feel a proper sense of guilt when somebody begs me to play at an
event where I know someone's version of the dream will be intruded on by a
not-quite-period ballad. I usually try to invite them to hear me play at a
post-revel, where this presents no problem. 
        The more global questions for the folk of the Rialto concern variation
between groups:
1) Are we (Carolingia) really a bunch of stuffy authenticity cops?
2) Is there such variation between groups that I would encounter such problems
throughout the laurel kingdoms?
3) Does anybody else have a similar problem?
4) What do you do when the local role models say, "You really shouldn't do
that, it's not period," and the crown gives you scrolls for the same behavior?
  
My only answers to these questions at present seem to be- take the scroll and
run. Quick, change your name, and adopt a mute alternate persona.

                                        Yours in Trepidation,

And, by all means, don't forget An Tir's most famous (well, she's the only
one in the Knowne World) royalty, the Dowager Princess Janeltis.  This
Lady is over 80 years old, and was so well loved by the (then) Principality
that they petitioned the BOD to make her permanent royalty.  She was not
the SO of her Prince (Edward, I think, but my memory is notoriously bad)
at the time of her reign.

Also, I heard tell (rumors, aren't they fun?) of a prince/king in Atenveldt
or somewhere thereabouts who took the nine-year-old daughter of a friend as
his consort.  Can anyone verify?

	True.  I know someone of the male gender who'd make a great
consort, but the women I know who fight here arn't interested in
winning crown...  (Insert smileys where needed.)  And he's *not*

	We just divided up the people still standing after the tourney

I think this discussion is no longer of great interest to the Rialto
at large (much as I would like to debate William de Corbie in this
same public forum he has used for his most recent arguments).
Therefore, I will continue via electronic mail directly to him.

Let me enter a plea for courtesy.  I did not intend to insult anyone
in my missives.  When editing, I tried to remove all comments which
might have been discourteous.  If my articles were in fact insulting,
please accept my apologies; so inform me, and I will strive to do
better.

HOWEVER, I expect a high level of courtesy from all others on this
Rialto.  In particular, the "Subject:" line
        Subject: The raven hacks out Tim's eyes
is uncalled-for and ungentlemanly.

Whats this voting stuff?  i.e. having "heirs" which must be approved
by "someone".

One of the biggest reasons that the West seems to have avoided many
problems with our royalty (and therefore laws) is that they only
reign for 4 months, not 6.  Whenever a questionable law, or an
unpopular Monarch occurs, in 4 months it doesn't matter.  The law
gets changed back, or the Monarch steps down.

Many times (in the West) people "disappear" for a few months, and
wait for a Monarch they dislike to step down.  Wait "years" for a
Monarch who's "style of theater" I disliked to step down seems a bit
long.  (Basically, Court is theater)

Subject: Heraldry and alternate personas
Message-Id: <2757@tank.uchicago.edu>

personas. I am not a herald but my lady wife is, so I asked her.
The heralds will only register one device per mundane person. 
Secondary personas may have their own badges, however, just as one
persona may have more than one badge. She does not know about names.
The next question is why one would want multiple personas. My own 
view is that nobody I know, myself certainly included, does even one
persona adequately. In almost all of the cases I have observed,
people who say they have two personas in fact have none-just one
20th century person with two kinds of costumes. I offer as 
evidence that in almost all cases, friends of one persona 
assume they are (and are assumed to be) friends of the other,
conversations are started with one and finished with the other,
and both personas have similar personal styles, opinions, etc.

One argument for multiple personae is that it makes it possible to
have clothes, or armor, or do dances from two different times or
places. I have two responses. The first is that the constraint of
having to find out how the thing you want to do would have been
done by your persona is one of the things that can push you into
interesting research. The second is that if you really want to do
things your persona could not have done (period dancing, for 
example, if your persona is pre-fifteenth century), there is, I
think, a better and less artificial excuse. Within the Society, 
you know people from many different times and places (although 
I prefer to let my persona assume that they are simply from 
different places, time travel not being a medieval concept-at least
not backwards time travel). There is no reason you cannot try to
copy a style of dress, or dance, or cooking, or armor, from one of
your foreign friends. The body armor I wear (Char Aina) is a type
probably too late and almost certainly too far east for my persona.
I started wearing it when I was living in the Shire of Black 
Diamond, along with Sir Ishmael ibn Murad-a mongol-persian from 
somewhat later than Cariadoc (a westerner, a Berber from North
Africa). Ishmael had what looked like a very practical piece of 
body armor, so I copied it. Later, when I was living in Grey 
Gargoyles, several people copied my Char Aina. Explaining it as a
piece of foreign armor they decided to imitate seems much less 
forced than adopting late eastern Muslim alternate personae.

Greetings!

As promised (threatened?), below are listed the contents of the March '89
edition of _Things to Make_, the catalog for "'Queta's Closet".

"'Queta's Closet" is the title of Baroness Enriqueta de Reyes y Mora's
merchant booth.  All of the contents quoted in thisx posting are copyrighted
to her and reproduced here by her consent.

This catalog, which includes mail-order forms, is available upon request from
Baroness 'Queta.  Write to:  Harriet Stetser, 5703  19th Ave. South, Gulfport,
Fla.,  33707.  Or 'phone:  (813) 381-1238.  Note:  'Queta's a night owl, so
you can call her after 11 PM EST, when the rates are down (if you live far
enough east, that is :-) ).  And, she doesn't mind special requests.

Her Excellency will be merchanting at Pennsic this year, located at the corner
of Merchant's Row and Street of Dreams.  She welcomes people who wish to drop
by and chat about costuming, and to ask questions.  She will talk to people
quite happily, and at length :-), as time permits.

I can unequivocally recommend 'Queta's patterns out of personal knowledge and
experience, and do so.  They're an excellent resource as far as I'm concerned!

Btw-- if you contact Baroness 'Queta, or see her at the War, tell her Mistress
Cher sent you.  Who knows; maybe I'll get a commission...  :-)

               ---'QUETA'S CLOSET THINGS TO MAKE CATALOG---


ABOUT THE DESIGNER:  In her mundane world, Baroness Enriqueta Isabel de Reyes
y Mora, O. Pelican and O. Laurel, is _Harriet Stetser_, whose pursuits of
historical fact, fiction, and trivia have consumed the majority of her life...
so far!

She is an award-winning theatrical costume designer on the west coast of
Florida - specializing in other-than-contemporary stage plays.  With her
husband, Garrison, she is an antiques dealer and appraiser, and a collector of
15th, 16th, and 17th Century art, objects, and furniture.  For several years
she was on staff as the graphics and costume designer for a national
Renaissance Festival production company.  AND, she's a typically proud
grandmother!  (Wanna see some pictures?!)

During her long affiliation with the Society for Creative Anachronism, Inc.,
'Queta (as she's been nicknamed) has shared her mundane talents through
teaching and publishing a dozen "HOW TO..." booklets on costuming and other
subjects, and has created a number of full-size costume accessory patterns.

'Queta invites your questions and requests for help on "matters costume".  Her
personal library contains about 200 books on the subject, and she will happily
(cor-)respond!


FASHIONABLE HISTORY:  PATTERNS AVAILABLE--

All patterns include _full-sized_ pattern pieces, _complete_, step by step,
illustrated, assembly instructions (with Fabric Requirements and Selection),
and a "history" of the piece.  Individual sizing alterations, if necessry, are
explained.

#101; $4.00:  French, German Beret and Spanish Toque, 16th Century:  _THE_
most versatile gentleman's 'hat' in history!  A brimmed, soft full-crowned hat
which changes style, personality, and national identitication with a push of
your hand; or becomes the high-fashion, tall-crowned hat popular in the later
16th Century.

#102; $4.00:  French Bonnet, circa 1485-1525:  A universal favorite in England
and across Europe.  A low 4-piece crown, with a split, turned-up, laced brim.
Appropriate for all classes, all countries.

#103; $3.00:  The "Porkpie" or "Pillox" Coif or Toque, 13th and 14th
Centuries:  THE necessary accessory for the well-dressed Medieval lady, this
white "pillbox" was worn from the early 1200's to the early 1300's.  Two
styles are patterned - round crown (early period) and oval crown (later).

#104; $3.00:  Elizabethan Embroidered Coif:  An unusual shape, taken directly
from a Victoria and Albert Museum example.  Actual embroidery is shown in
enlarged photography - ready to trace and transfer.

#105; $4.00: the Tudor Over-Partlet, circa 1550:  A little-known accessory
garment, a velvet yoke worn _over_ the usual square-necked Tudor gown, as a
warm cover-up and a fashion style change for a too-oft-seen Court gown.

#106; $2.00:  The Basic Coif, for men or women:  Used first by 13th Cent.
_men_, and later by 15th and 16th Century women, this super-simple "cap" has a
variety of uses - worn alone or under the helm or mail hood by men, or worn
alone or under their various headdresses by ladies of quality.

#107; $4.00:  The Tudor and Elizabethan Flat Cap:  For lords _and_ ladies,
this most popular 16th Century hat style is jaunty, comfortable, and _easy to

wearer's social status.

This fashionable accessory is a MUST for all 16th Century Englis personae, to
complete and authenticate the costume ensemble.

unusual accessory!  For lords _and_ ladies looking for _high_ style at the
turn of the 14th to 15th Centuries.  This dickey tucks neatly inside the
neckline of a collarless houppelande or tunic to disply the _very_ fashionable
neck-hugging, fluted collar.  Or... use only the collar pattern to add to your
own houppelande pattern for a "contest legal" garment.

#109; $4.50:  Cavalier Collars:  _SIX_ different styles for the Musketeer, the
Cavalier, your favorite Royalist!  The famous "falling collar" identifies th

fitting and illustrated construction instructions, and history.  At last the
whole wardrobe is in your hands!

Message-ID: <890417235546.15.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

A reply to Tim (McDaniel), the bizarre enchanter.

1. Only a small percentage of the population are homosexuals (let's avoid
a debate about the exact numbers, please). The overwhelming majority are
heterosexuals. Our culture and the behavioral patterns in our society are
more or less built on the assumption that all people are heterosexuals. This 
is a fact of life, wether you like it or not.

This means that heterosexuality is the "default". A male/female couple on
the thrones is merely the normal thing. It is not propagating anything.
It is what we expect. A homosexual couple on the thrones are deviating
from the normal pattern, and are making their sexual preferences obvious,
wether they want that or not. The fact that they co-rule because of their
sexual relationship becomes extremely visible - much more so than with a
male/female couple.

2. I have never met any homosexual who thought that heterosexuality was
wrong. But I have met many people who consider homosexual acts a sin. Since
everybody accepts heterosexuality, having a male/female couple on the throne
cannot possibly hurt anyone's feelings. But having an openly homosexual
couple there can and will.

3. Like you, I also diapprove of drunkenness and any number of other sins.
But there is a big difference between a drunkard who says "Okay, I know that
I am doing something wrong, and I would like to stop this excessive drinking"
and one who says "I have a right to be as drunk as I want to be, I think it
is right to be drunk, and I encourage everyone who hasn't tried it to get
drunk". An openly gay couple on the throne are saying that it is right to
perform homosexual acts. I cannot subscribe to that. I cannot perform any
act which signifies acceptance of that.

4. I agree that fealty does not imply that I approve of everything the King
& Queen do. But it does imply that I accept what they stand for in persona
- perhaps not every single detail, but in general. When I swear fealty, I do 
this not only to the King & Queen as individual personas, but also to their 
relationship in persona. They are a couple, a unity, on the thrones. Regardless
of wether they are lovers in mundania or not, their reign implies a sexual
relationship in persona. A same-sex couple on the thrones are making themselves
homosexuals in persona. They are bringing their mundane sexual relationship
visibly into the sphere of what I cannot avoid as their vassal.

It is my faith that God loves the sinner but hates sin. God loves the
homosexual but not the homosexual acts that the gay person performs.
Anyone who performs a sin may get forgiveness upon repentance. But if
he does not repent, he is in rebellion against God. Consorting with 
him in such a way as to accept his deeds is to make myself responsible
for these deeds. I cannot do that, and I refuse to be a member of a society
which tries to intimidate or coerce me into doing that. This applies not
only to open homosexuality, but to any open defiance of God.

I recognize the right of others to have a different religion and a different
belief concerning what is the will of God. If there is a majority in the SCA
for accepting openly admitted thieves, murderers, blasphemers, homosexuals,
drunkards etcetera as the official and ceremonial representatives of the ideals
of this Society, then I can't do anything about that - except leave. Which is
what I will do, if and when membership in the SCA comes to mean acceptance
of things that are incompatible with my faith.

Personally, I don't really see that this is a great problem, as long
as the name is close.  In your example: Owen & Owain are two common
spellings of the same Welsh name.  They are the same name.  If the
gentle lived in Skrealing Althing, then he IS Owen of Skrealing
Althing.  He is also Owen atte Thorn (good name, by the way!), and he
may also be described in many other ways.

Similarly, I am Arval Benicoeur, or Arval of Rusted Woodlands, or
Arvaldus Heraldus, or Arval Kingsherald, etc.  Such variation of
bynames is perfectly correct period usage.  The fact that the College
of Arms registers only a single form of your name has fostered the
fallacy that there is ONLY one correct form of your name.  That's
silly.  There may be only one FORMAL spelling of your name, but in
appropriate circumstances,other forms will be used.  If Lord Owen got
his award specifically for service to his shire, it seems quite
reasonable to use that byname to describe him, does it not?

There was an event I went to over a year ago at which they played
some Viking Football, this was in the shire of Strikkenwood.  But 
it was a bit different than how you describe it.

They had two teams -- 4 people on a side?  (Kwellend, help!)  The
object was a rubber Medusa's head.  You could pass the head around.
As I recall a dead fighter would have to sit out awhile.  As you'd
expect there was a goal at each end of the field.  And so on.  I really
don't remember many details -- but it was fun to watch ...

I first investigated "Christianity, Social Tolerance, and
Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the
Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century", by John Boswell, The
University of Chicago Press, (c) 1980, ISBN 0-226-06711-4 (paperback)
or ...10-6 (cloth).  He discusses Richard I on pages 231--232.  I find
certain of his arguments unconvincing because he seems to overstate
his case.  However, he knows a number of ancient languages; he is a
scholar of good repute (although biased in this case); he has good
references to other sources, primary and secondary; he gives the
original texts for many of his translations.

Boswell gives a quote from Roger of Hovedon in Latin and in English
(#1 below).  He points out that Richard twice repented of "that sin"
and resolved to lead a better life (#2).  He points out that Richard's
Queen, Berengaria, was extremely obscure, and that no mistresses of
Richard are known (#3).

=====

[1] Boswell quotes (below) from "Gesta regis Henrici Secundi Benedicti
abbatis", ed. William Stubbs (London, 1867), 2:7.  An almost identical
passage occurs in "The Annals of Roger of Hovedon", trans. Henry Riley
(London 1853), 2:63-64.

"Ricardus dux Aquitaniae, filius regis Angliae, moram fecit cum
Philipo rege Franciae, quem ipse in tantum honoravit per longum tempus
quod singulis diebus in una mensa as unum catinum manducabant, et in
noctibus non seperabat eos lectus.  Et dilexit eum rex Franciae quasi
animam suam; et in tantum se mutuo diligebant, quod proper vehementem
dilectionem quae inter illos erat, dominus rex Angliae nimio stupore
arreptus admirabatur quid hoc esset."

This is translated by Boswell as

"Richard, [then] duke of Aquitane, son of the king of England,
remained with Philip, the king of France, who so honored him for so
long that they are every day at the same table and from the same dish,
and at night their beds did not separate them.  And the king of France
loved him as his own soul; and they loved each other so much that the
king of England was absolutely astonished at the passionate love
between them and marveled at it."

I consulted a professor of Classical Latin here at the U of I about
this.  He said that, unless the meaning of "dilectionem / dilexit"
changed during the Middle Ages, it has the connotation of "esteem" or
"agape" (in Greek) rather than more carnal implications ("amare").
Further, Boswell translated "vehementem" as "passionate".  So I
suppose that Boswell used the most favorable translation for his
purposes.  The translation by Riley uses more sedate language, like
"esteem".  Further, Roger of Hovedon makes clear in a few lines that
Henry II became worried about Philip aiding Richard in rebellion (a
persistent problem with Henry's sons).

On the other hand, the king of France was hardly short of beds in his
own palace.  I doubt that even the closest of friends shared the same
bed, if more were available.  This action is even more
incomprehensible if they were merely allies in a military cause.

[2] Boswell would have done better to look more closely at Richard's
public penances.  On two occasions, Richard did public penance for
offenses which included sexual immorality.  However, he listed other
sins (wine, extravagance, etc.); Boswell notes "there is no indication
that he regarded it as any more serious than the types of high living
... for which all religious monarchs (and most writers) of the Middle
Ages occasionally did penance".

The second penance was in Eastertime of 1195, I think.  Hovedon (in
2:356--57) records that an unnamed hermit reproached Richard in
Sicily, saying "Be thou mindful of the destruction of Sodom, and
abstain from what is unlawful, ...."  Richard ignored him (although
the hermit found it prudent to withdraw elsewhere) until an illness
afflicted him.  Richard made a confession, "took back his wife, whom
for a long time he had not known, and putting away all illicit
intercourse, ..."  Hovedon doesn't actually say that Richard confessed
to "sodomy", but that's the clear implication.

[3] Boswell writes, "He was married but died without legitimate
offspring, and so few people knew about his wife [Berengaria] that she
had to sue the pope after his death to be recognized as his heir.  All
his biographers agreed that 'it was no marriage'."  I thought
Berengaria had to sue because of King John's greed in wanting to keep
her dowry.  Also, I've met previously-married men with children who
were nevertheless gay; it is a common fallacy that "gay" -> "can never
perform sexually with any woman".

However, note how atypical the situation was.  They were married N
years (8?).  She was the only Queen of England who never set foot in
England (granted, he wasn't in England much himself, but she could
have followed him there).  She was separated from him for most of
their marriage, even when it would have been convenient for them to
meet.  They had no children when one of the primary duties of a king
and queen was to beget children.  In Roger of Hovedon's long chronicle
(several hundred pages), she is mentioned at most 5 times; the
references total to less than half a page.  Has ANY Queen, of any
nation, of such duration, EVER come so near to complete obscurity?

Further, Richard had one rather obscure bastard (I didn't write down
the name -- I saw only one biography mention him).  He gave this
bastard a castle or two; said bastard was never of any public note
thereafter.  The name of this bastard's mother is totally unknown.
Consider how often royal mistresses occurred, and how often they were
well-known: Alice and Fair Rosamund for Henry II, "Salisbury" for
Edward III ...  In fact, the only reason we know that Richard ever had
a mistress is because of this by-blow.

=====

Boswell lists some of Richard's biographies: Kate Norgate, "Richard
the Lion Heart" (London, 1924); Philip Henderson, "Richard Coeur de
Lion" (London, 1958); and James Brundage, "Richard Lion Heart" (New
York, 1974).  "Norgate's biography remains the best, despite her
reticence on this subject."  Brundage considers Richard to be
homosexual; Henderson refers to "dark hints" about his sexual
proclivities.  (Or was it Norgate?  Drat!  I should have checked them
out from the library.)

My summary?  Nothing can be absolutely proven beyond *any* doubt at
this remove, unless someone finds a document reading
        "Sodomitus sum.  Philipo amo.
                [s] Ricardus, rex Angliae"
:-)

Consider that chroniclers had a tendency to suppress or invent things.
Unpopular kings had every vice in the book ascribed to them; for
popular kings, doings that might cause scandal were often hushed up.

I consider the strongest evidence to be Richard's second confession as
given in Hovedon, which comes THAT close to calling him a "sodomite".
Second in strength is the evidence (or, rather, lack of same) in re
Berengaria or mistresses.  I think that the preponderance of evidence
shows that Richard was homosexual.

As for Richard and Philip Augustus being lovers: there IS
documentation, of a sort.  To me, it seems that one source is too
slender to prove a case with, even if one doesn't question Richard's
homosexuality.  I think the appropriate verdict is the Scots' verdict,
"not proven" -- "not guilty, and don't do it again".

Unto the Good Gentlefolk of the Rialto, greetings.  Pardon me for this
message, but I was slow in entering this discussion now old; I have
been composing this message for too long.

Suppose that a Knight has a man who he loves and who is willing to be
his Consort, willing to perform the Consort's public duties and to be
a help meet for the King's work.  But suppose this Knight fights for a
stranger to be his Queen, not even attempting to elevate his "beloved"
to royal dignity.  Whether you agree or not, I would call this man a
hypocrite, and no Knight.  I would deem that this man has denied his
Beloved; by giving the greatest possible honor to another, he has
failed him.


I would answer a missive of William de Corbie:

>All I was trying to say was that consorts of the same sex would make the
>throne a platform for gay liberation (if the King and consort were openly
>homosexual lovers).

Pardon me?  Does mere sitting as a couple "make the throne a platform
for gay liberation" (as opposed to speeches, etc.)?  Does the mere
showing that gay couples exist constitute such an act?  Most current
Kings are open bedmates of the Queen.  Do they not then use the throne
as a platform to promote heterosexuality?  Does this not "make the
throne a platform"?

>Swearing fealty in such a reign would signify an open acceptance of
>homosexual activities and relationships.

Excuse me?  I disapprove of drunkenness and smoking, for I think them
most damaging and foolish.  There are many drinkers and smokers who
are Barons and Kings.  Does my swearing fealty to a drunkard King mean
that I approve of alcoholism?  I think not!

Homage-and-fealty implies many things for a vassal (in period and in
the Knowne World): I have a right and a duty to give counsel; I am
obligated to obey lawful orders; I have the duty to assist the King to
protect his rights and carry out his duties; I have various rights due
me from the King.  By no means does fealty mean that "I completely
approve of the King and of everything he does"!  Not even "I approve
of the King in general".  Sometimes, fealty (in period and in the
Modern Middle Ages) must perforce be said through gritted teeth.  "I
mislike this man, but he is King in this time, and I have a duty to
help him, to protect the kingdom from the King if naught else."

>I think that all such personal matters should be kept off the thrones.

What?  But that is not at all the current practice.  In the Midrealm,
most Queens have been the wife or lover of the King.  My source is a
very long-time member, who could only think of 2 counterexamples
immediately.  (Michael the Abominable and Zarina I, and Talymar I and
"Valmi"?  More examples are most welcome.)  Indeed, many think that a
King not choosing his beloved may imply disrespect or dishonor upon
this beloved, unless there is an evident disability (pregnancy, say).
For it may be that the King thinks his beloved incompetent to uphold
the royal honor and duties.

Why is commendable for opposite-sex couples to proclaim and confirm
their quite *personal* relationships in this very *public* manner,
while same-sex couples dare not?  If the King wishes to bestow the
greatest title of honor on his beloved, why is it commendable if his
beloved is female, but not commendable if male?

>I expect gay people to respect my beliefs on this matter, as a matter
>of courtesy if nothing else.

My lord of Corbie, most certainly I respect your right to have such
beliefs as you choose, but I need not agree with you, or act in a
manner consistent with your beliefs.

But I cannot even understand the reasons for your positions.  I shall
reread them, and try harder.

Several gentles have written me about the rules for Four Seasons Chess.  The
answer is "I don't know."  Forgive me, I have succumbed to that non-European
game of Go, and I don't know how to play chess, which is why I drafted Daffyd
to be list master for the chocolate chess tourney.  We didn't have rules
either, jsut a general description.  It proved inadequate, but the pieces were
eaten before that lack of rules became a problem, so it was a four way draw.

Basically, it works like this.  Four players sit at the four corners of the
board.  They each have half a set of pieces.  The traditonal colors are red,
white, blue, and green.  Each player is on their own, but there were some
informal alliances worked out.  "He's good, let's everybody pick on him first."

Some problems: Pawns never get to t he middle of the board, they only move on
the exterior files where they started, unless they change files by capturing.
And how do pawns capture?  And where do pawns have to get to to be advanced?
Is castling allowed if king and rook can get to the proper configuration?
And so on.  If anybody can come up with the rules, I'd like them too.

Yours in service to making it up as I go along,

I spent too many years working with gay men and women in professional

tolerant than society in general.  Just goes to show - you don't

Regarding, uh, nonstandard tourneys:

I have not seen Viking Football at an SCA event, but it was quite
popular with Markland awhile back.

There are four quarters, of three to four minutes apiece.  The object is
to carry the most members of the opposing team across your goal.
Gauntlets and helms required; other armor optional (but desirable!)
There is no ball.

I remember hearing warnings to make *darn* sure that Johann (300+ lb
blacksmith and karate champ) and Jezadiah (280 lb semipro rugby player)
are on opposite sides ....

I am fairly certain, Mistress Cher, that the question originally posed
referred to the heraldic registration of alternate persona names, not
the membership registration.  The Registry has absolutely nothing to
do with the heralds' office.  The Registry will put ANYTHING on a
membership card, as long as you pays your money.  Heraldic
registration is a different beast altogether, and the two are not
connected in any way.

I think you are mis-stating a bit here: The purpose of registering a
name with the College of Arms is to prevent anyone else in the Society
using a similar name.  From the point of view of the College, this is
the only purpose.  In practice, the list of names in the Armorial does
serve as a sort of official list of standard spellings of names, but
that is not a design feature.  Furthermore, there is no particular
reason that the Crown shouldn't put an alternate persona name on a
scroll.  For example, Master El of the Two Knives has an alternate
persona Kay the Minstrel.  In this persona, he is a minstrel and a
herald.  SHould he receive awards for those activities, it would be
most courteous to give them to the alternate persona.  On the other
hand, I rather agree with you that using multiple names leads to lots
of confusion!

Each individual may register one alternate persona name and as many as
three badges.  These limits were set 4 or 5 years ago.

Good cheer to all!

Subject: Alternate personae

	Unto the good folk of the Rialto, howdy!

	As for alternate personae, i'm very much in favor of them. I 
have a lot of interests, some that can't be merged into one persona.
Rather than just dressing in the garb of a random period when I feel
like a change, I'd much rather explore in depth another aspect of the
past.  Researching a persona is half the fun, anyway.  Quite a few of 
the people I know have some kind of alternate persona, especially those
interested in the Orient/ Central Asia.
	This doesn't mean I will go so far as to try to register an
alternate persona with a badge.  I think that it's simpl unnecessary,
and is unfair to the College of Arms.  I already have an official name
and a registered device (just recently--praise be to the Laurel Queen of
Arms).  As for what people would call me, that's quite simple too--
no one calls me by my real Society name (Taliesin) but by a name that
I chose when I first joined (Dylan) but couldn't register (so it's a
god's name, who's to know?).  
	Just my two cents worth....

Date: Fri, 14 Apr 89 12:41:55 PST



Hello good gentles, greetings from Tibor of Rock Valley.
 
Most flame wars and opinion displays I ignore, to the best of my ability.
But I am afraid the possturing which concerns the gender/sexual practices
of crown tourney entrants, especially William de Corbie, is something I
cannot avoid participation in.
 
William writes:

  Conversely, I don't care who you love, how you love them, how many
of them there are, or what there gender is: love between humans is good.
I must admit that I have a gut reaction against people who quote the
Bible as a method of justifying discrimination against others: therefore
I feel about Milord Williams posting about the same way as I feel about
the Ayatollah Khomeini posturing against Salman Rushdie.  And I resent
the conceptualization that since the rules of the BOD, etcetera are
supporting a particular religious viewpoint, they are a good thing, to
be a seed of bigotry, and fanatacism. (A note here, William.  I know
you didn't write the rules, so I am not aiming this canon at you, per
se.  But I do observe that your justification of them is weakly grounded,
as it does not generalize to all religions, or to those who observe none.)
Just for the record, I do wonder about having two kings simultaneously,
if a man fought for another, or two queens.  I wonder how that would
be addressed.  I would also note that England seems to have no trouble with
having one Majesty on the throne at this time, why must ours come in pairs?
 
  William, would you have the same trouble swearing fealty to people who
live together?  People unlawfully divorced in a foreign country?  Who
don't believe in the divinity of christ? Jews, Moslems, Buddhists?
Why pick one brand of "sinner"?
 
> I may have served kings and princes who were openly gay, but as
> long as I didn't know about it, it made no difference......
 
  Oh.  Why or why not?  Does ignorance on your part mitigate religious
grounds (I didn't know it was a sin, so it wasn't).
 
> The purpose of this posting is to illuminate the point that the sexual
> inclinations of the king/queen are best kept out of the official life

> what we should have.
 
  These two don't follow.  Besides, what if the King and Queen were both
openly gay, but not partnered with each other, except for political
reasons?  How would this help?  If you have a problem with the gay
population, and swearing fealty, you have a problem, regardless of
who is fought for, and who fights.

In SCA Digest #302, Chelidon o Gaerddrych (hoffman@gondor.cs.psu.edu
(Richard C. Hoffman)) writes about "Combat Sheep Rugby".

In Ealdormere, we know this game as Buzkashi, spellings vary. Buzkashi is
the Afghan national sport and a precursor of polo. Real Buzkashi is
played by armed and armoured horsemen, using a real dead sheep. And real
weapons! See the first episode of "The Ascent of Man".

For the Eoforwic "East meets West" event, about ten years ago, Baron
Torbin of Amberhall devised the first SCA Buzkashi rules. Single swords,
the sheep may be used as a shield. There are no teams - the last man
holding the sheep as it rounds the second pole scores the point for the
game. There is honour in carrying the sheep, even if it gets you killed.
Resurrection applies, of course. The sheep's name is Murphy (in Eoforwic)
or Fuscia (in Skraeling Althing).

 Point of clarification:  the Registry (i.e. Box 360743 and the gentles
 thereof) is not responsible for registering names.  As the membership
 application attempts to indicate, they ask for reference only.
 Names are officially registered by the Heralds (i.e. the College of Arms).

 Another clarification:  As I understand it, only names, badges, and
 devices are registered, not personae.


(Your points are well taken, Cher, but it seemed wise to comment on
these issues to prevent misunderstandings of these concepts,
which many people seem to be unclear on.)

It's even worse when people who have registered SCA names get AoAs

Oops.  *Blush*.  Yes, Morguhn and *Maurya*.  Argh.  Certainly no insult

Countess Amber, who sat the throne with Hasterbul in his second reign, had
the same problem; people kept calling her Kunagunda.  (I believe a herald
did this once in court; oops.)  I don't think she ever found a solution.)

On the subject of silly tourneys: Last fall the Debatable Lands held Clown
Tourney (in honor of our retiring BOD member).  We had a "weapons
proficiency" style of tourney; there were several "lists" (8 or 9, in this
case; the traditional style is one per weapons form) and determined the
overall winner by assigning points based on how far people got in each list.
Our lists included: pillow (with one enterprising entrant fighting

I was rather stressed when I wrote this, transposing VI into IV.  Perhaps
it was Philip the Good who was Mad Henry's contemporary.  Someone correct

As promised, some good advice for anyone who'd like to try and beat
me at next year's Ice Dragon Pent.

Hint #1

DOCUMENTATION IS A PROCESS WHICH HAPPENS *BEFORE* YOU MAKE AN OBJECT

Half the Laurels, Manches, and arts officers of the Kingdom of the East
were approached in the month before Ice Dragon by persons who wanted
help "documenting" the pent entries they had *already* made.  These
people were thinking about the documentation too late.  When you
document *post facto* you are wasting your time documenting and you
probably wasted your time making the thing you hope to document.

If you think of making a new-medieval object of any sort you should
begin by gathering all the information you can about the real ones-
that is, the medieval examples.  Items on display in museums,
photographs of pieces in collections, archeological reports, all of
these are useful and this information is, in fact, the "documentation"
of your project (as opposed to the documentation being the forty-two
words you can fit on a 3X5 card).  Many persons who do careful and
excellent work make files of photocopies and /or sketches.  If you
adopt this practice, be sure to write down on your copies and sketches
where you got the information- museum, bibliographical information,
whatever.

If you then work from your file of information you can be far surer
that the object you're making has some kind of historical authenticity.
And if you then have to produce "documentation" for a comp, exhibition,
or display, you just go to your file, pull out your photocopies and
citations, and condense the information there onto a tiny bit of paper.
No problem.

I thought this discussion was about the "sex" of the

As to swearing fealty:  I wouldn't want to swear fealty to anyone
who used the Throne to further their person "religious" beliefs, of

   For a brief while we (BMDL, K of E) were trying out "Trollball" games.
This was based on the Trollball game described in one of the FRP games,
I believe Runequest.  Five people on the field per team (one was goalie),
two alternates.  Blunt weapons only, polearms considered blunt.  We had a
stuffed 'trollkin', which acted as the ball.  The trollkin was designed to fall
apart easily, with quick repair.  The object of the game was to get the 'live
part' of the trollkin across the goal line.  This meant that the trollkin was
considered 'dead' if you tore off more than one limb, or if the head came
off or the body fell in two.  Once anyone died (abdomen shots were
considered 'hideous wounds') they had to be 'carried' (escorted) to the
sideline where they were replaced and then revived.

   The one play where opposing players passed each other and each ended
up with half of the trollkin (top and bottom) caused several gentles to fall
down laughing, as did the pass where the body went in one direction and
the head in another.
   When the trollkin died, players could refresh the teams by clearing the
dead; this became an important factor.  The person carrying the trollkin
was not allowed to strike it - but it was permissable to parry with him...

   We tried a couple of games here, and one at Pennsic XV(?), but it sadly
didn't catch on.
   We did find that the lighter armored fighters (especially the ones wearing
running shoes) had to be evenly distributed between teams...

Greetings Gentles - 

  I have been following this discussion and would like to 
offer a different (maybe?) view.... It seems to me that it
is agreed upon fact that there were gay Kings of period.  
But even those who were "public" with this had an opposite-sex
Queen... I imagine that the intricacies of such a court 
along with the various "barbs" thrown back and forth must
have been spectacular.   Why not in the SCA?  I, personally,
don't see anything wrong with a gay King (or Queen) who,
during court occasions sit with a different-sex consort, but
during feasts is more often seen with their "lover" ... This
would needs be a "reign among friends" as some of the "discussions"
during that feast would over cook the meat! :-)

If the homosexual couple, like any heterosexual couple, decide to *choose* 
a different consort, that is fine.  But the point is, that homosexual couples,
like heterosexual couples, should have the option to *choose* instead of 
being told that they must have a friend for a consort instead of their SO. 
More applause to Jehanna (sp?) for cutting to the heart of the issue.  

On a similar note, I have a gay friend who is interested in the SCA, but has
been reticent to join because he does not want to be forced into the "mating
game", either.  If there are any other gay men in the society who have 
suggestions or stories about how they handled the SCA, please respond by
email.

Old errors stick!
There are still those who are commenting on my first posting about "same
sex consorts". That posting was unclear and badly phrased, and I have later
posted another one where I tried to make myself clearer. Since this has
obviously not reached everyone, let me repeat some of the contents.

I do not intend to debate the issue of the ethical validity of homosexuality
on the SCA-net, because it doesn't belong here. I fear such a discussion
would become an endless series of flames (like hell). I therefore refrain
from answering those who have questioned my views on that matter. Write
personal email to me if you want to discuss it further.

All I was trying to say was that consorts of the same sex would make the
throne a platform for gay liberation (if the King and consort were openly
homosexual lovers). Swearing fealty in such a reign would signify an open
acceptance of homosexual activities and relationships. I think that all such
personal matters should be kept off the thrones. If the king/queen used 
the throne as a platform for preaching a certain religion or political
ideology, I would find that also distasteful.

I have no problem with gay people, but I refuse to perform any action
that would signify acceptance of homosexual activities. I expect gay people
to respect my beliefs on this matter, as a matter of courtesy if nothing else.

Good Evening All,
   I have been watching the discussion lately with much intrest. Concerning
same sex consorts I believe I have been persuaded that Lady Awilda has the
right idea. My belief is that the king and queen should be of different sexes
IN PERSONA. If a male wished to take on a female persona and annother wished to
name his female personna his queen I see no problem. The same is true of a
female who takes on a male persona becomming king. I apologize for the added 
verbage to a subject that it appears most of us has made up thier minds about.

Regarding, uh, nonstandard tourneys:

I have not seen Viking Football at an SCA event, but it was quite
popular with Markland awhile back.

There are four quarters, of three to four minutes apiece.  The object is
to carry the most members of the opposing team across your goal.
Gauntlets and helms required; other armor optional (but desirable!)
There is no ball.

I remember hearing warnings to make *darn* sure that Johann (300+ lb
blacksmith and karate champ) and Jezadiah (280 lb semipro rugby player)
are on opposite sides ....

I am fairly certain, Mistress Cher, that the question originally posed
referred to the heraldic registration of alternate persona names, not
the membership registration.  The Registry has absolutely nothing to
do with the heralds' office.  The Registry will put ANYTHING on a
membership card, as long as you pays your money.  Heraldic
registration is a different beast altogether, and the two are not
connected in any way.

I think you are mis-stating a bit here: The purpose of registering a
name with the College of Arms is to prevent anyone else in the Society
using a similar name.  From the point of view of the College, this is
the only purpose.  In practice, the list of names in the Armorial does
serve as a sort of official list of standard spellings of names, but
that is not a design feature.  Furthermore, there is no particular
reason that the Crown shouldn't put an alternate persona name on a
scroll.  For example, Master El of the Two Knives has an alternate
persona Kay the Minstrel.  In this persona, he is a minstrel and a
herald.  SHould he receive awards for those activities, it would be
most courteous to give them to the alternate persona.  On the other
hand, I rather agree with you that using multiple names leads to lots
of confusion!

Each individual may register one alternate persona name and as many as
three badges.  These limits were set 4 or 5 years ago.

Good cheer to all!

	Unto the good folk of the Rialto, howdy!

	As for alternate personae, i'm very much in favor of them. I 
have a lot of interests, some that can't be merged into one persona.
Rather than just dressing in the garb of a random period when I feel
like a change, I'd much rather explore in depth another aspect of the
past.  Researching a persona is half the fun, anyway.  Quite a few of 
the people I know have some kind of alternate persona, especially those
interested in the Orient/ Central Asia.
	This doesn't mean I will go so far as to try to register an
alternate persona with a badge.  I think that it's simpl unnecessary,
and is unfair to the College of Arms.  I already have an official name
and a registered device (just recently--praise be to the Laurel Queen of
Arms).  As for what people would call me, that's quite simple too--
no one calls me by my real Society name (Taliesin) but by a name that
I chose when I first joined (Dylan) but couldn't register (so it's a
god's name, who's to know?).  
	Just my two cents worth....

Subject: Why should a Kings/Queens sexuality matter?
Date: Fri, 14 Apr 89 12:41:55 PST



Hello good gentles, greetings from Tibor of Rock Valley.
 
Most flame wars and opinion displays I ignore, to the best of my ability.
But I am afraid the possturing which concerns the gender/sexual practices
of crown tourney entrants, especially William de Corbie, is something I
cannot avoid participation in.

  Conversely, I don't care who you love, how you love them, how many
of them there are, or what there gender is: love between humans is good.
I must admit that I have a gut reaction against people who quote the
Bible as a method of justifying discrimination against others: therefore
I feel about Milord Williams posting about the same way as I feel about
the Ayatollah Khomeini posturing against Salman Rushdie.  And I resent
the conceptualization that since the rules of the BOD, etcetera are
supporting a particular religious viewpoint, they are a good thing, to
be a seed of bigotry, and fanatacism. (A note here, William.  I know
you didn't write the rules, so I am not aiming this canon at you, per
se.  But I do observe that your justification of them is weakly grounded,
as it does not generalize to all religions, or to those who observe none.)
Just for the record, I do wonder about having two kings simultaneously,
if a man fought for another, or two queens.  I wonder how that would
be addressed.  I would also note that England seems to have no trouble with
having one Majesty on the throne at this time, why must ours come in pairs?
 
  William, would you have the same trouble swearing fealty to people who
live together?  People unlawfully divorced in a foreign country?  Who
don't believe in the divinity of christ? Jews, Moslems, Buddhists?
Why pick one brand of "sinner"?
 
> I may have served kings and princes who were openly gay, but as
> long as I didn't know about it, it made no difference......
 
  Oh.  Why or why not?  Does ignorance on your part mitigate religious
grounds (I didn't know it was a sin, so it wasn't).
 
> The purpose of this posting is to illuminate the point that the sexual

  These two don't follow.  Besides, what if the King and Queen were both
openly gay, but not partnered with each other, except for political
reasons?  How would this help?  If you have a problem with the gay
population, and swearing fealty, you have a problem, regardless of
who is fought for, and who fights.

Subject:  Combat Sheep Rugby, aka Buzkashi

In SCA Digest #302, Chelidon o Gaerddrych (hoffman@gondor.cs.psu.edu
(Richard C. Hoffman)) writes about "Combat Sheep Rugby".

In Ealdormere, we know this game as Buzkashi, spellings vary. Buzkashi is
the Afghan national sport and a precursor of polo. Real Buzkashi is
played by armed and armoured horsemen, using a real dead sheep. And real
weapons! See the first episode of "The Ascent of Man".

For the Eoforwic "East meets West" event, about ten years ago, Baron
Torbin of Amberhall devised the first SCA Buzkashi rules. Single swords,
the sheep may be used as a shield. There are no teams - the last man
holding the sheep as it rounds the second pole scores the point for the
game. There is honour in carrying the sheep, even if it gets you killed.
Resurrection applies, of course. The sheep's name is Murphy (in Eoforwic)
or Fuscia (in Skraeling Althing).

 Point of clarification:  the Registry (i.e. Box 360743 and the gentles
 thereof) is not responsible for registering names.  As the membership
 application attempts to indicate, they ask for reference only.
 Names are officially registered by the Heralds (i.e. the College of Arms).

 Another clarification:  As I understand it, only names, badges, and
 devices are registered, not personae.


(Your points are well taken, Cher, but it seemed wise to comment on
these issues to prevent misunderstandings of these concepts,
which many people seem to be unclear on.)

Oops.  *Blush*.  Yes, Morguhn and *Maurya*.  Argh.  Certainly no insult
was meant to HRH (or HRM by the time many see this?) Maurya!  (I believe 
Countess Amber, who sat the throne with Hasterbul in his second reign, had
the same problem; people kept calling her Kunagunda.  (I believe a herald
did this once in court; oops.)  I don't think she ever found a solution.)

On the subject of silly tourneys: Last fall the Debatable Lands held Clown
Tourney (in honor of our retiring BOD member).  We had a "weapons
proficiency" style of tourney; there were several "lists" (8 or 9, in this
case; the traditional style is one per weapons form) and determined the
overall winner by assigning points based on how far people got in each list.
Our lists included: pillow (with one enterprising entrant fighting
two-pillow), dagger (boffer), tiddlywinks, an "illegible blackletter"
competition, a couple of "debates", and a couple more.  The "tilting at
rings" would have worked ok if the promised tricycles had arrived; assigning
the larger fighters to act as "mounts" didn't work all that well.  I'll
definitely have to pass along the "bar brawl" idea to whoever autocrats the
next Clown (nope, not me, nosiree!); it sounds like lots of fun!

I was rather stressed when I wrote this, transposing VI into IV.  Perhaps

The following is another posting I am putting up for Mistress Niccola
Sebastiani who does not have access to the net. - Orlando
----
As promised, some good advice for anyone who'd like to try and beat
me at next year's Ice Dragon Pent.

Hint #1

DOCUMENTATION IS A PROCESS WHICH HAPPENS *BEFORE* YOU MAKE AN OBJECT

Half the Laurels, Manches, and arts officers of the Kingdom of the East
were approached in the month before Ice Dragon by persons who wanted
help "documenting" the pent entries they had *already* made.  These
people were thinking about the documentation too late.  When you
document *post facto* you are wasting your time documenting and you
probably wasted your time making the thing you hope to document.

If you think of making a new-medieval object of any sort you should
begin by gathering all the information you can about the real ones-
that is, the medieval examples.  Items on display in museums,
photographs of pieces in collections, archeological reports, all of
these are useful and this information is, in fact, the "documentation"
of your project (as opposed to the documentation being the forty-two
words you can fit on a 3X5 card).  Many persons who do careful and
excellent work make files of photocopies and /or sketches.  If you
adopt this practice, be sure to write down on your copies and sketches
where you got the information- museum, bibliographical information,
whatever.

If you then work from your file of information you can be far surer
that the object you're making has some kind of historical authenticity.
And if you then have to produce "documentation" for a comp, exhibition,
or display, you just go to your file, pull out your photocopies and
citations, and condense the information there onto a tiny bit of paper.
No problem.

I thought this discussion was about the "sex" of the

Kings/Queens/etc who I thought didn't "have any sexuality at all",
(personal opion).

As to swearing fealty:  I wouldn't want to swear fealty to anyone
who used the Throne to further their person "religious" beliefs, of
any kind.

Should I start trying to convince my Knight to fight for me?  I'm

   For a brief while we (BMDL, K of E) were trying out "Trollball" games.
This was based on the Trollball game described in one of the FRP games,
I believe Runequest.  Five people on the field per team (one was goalie),
two alternates.  Blunt weapons only, polearms considered blunt.  We had a
stuffed 'trollkin', which acted as the ball.  The trollkin was designed to fall
apart easily, with quick repair.  The object of the game was to get the 'live
part' of the trollkin across the goal line.  This meant that the trollkin was
considered 'dead' if you tore off more than one limb, or if the head came
off or the body fell in two.  Once anyone died (abdomen shots were
considered 'hideous wounds') they had to be 'carried' (escorted) to the
sideline where they were replaced and then revived.

   The one play where opposing players passed each other and each ended
up with half of the trollkin (top and bottom) caused several gentles to fall
down laughing, as did the pass where the body went in one direction and
the head in another.
   When the trollkin died, players could refresh the teams by clearing the
dead; this became an important factor.  The person carrying the trollkin
was not allowed to strike it - but it was permissable to parry with him...

   We tried a couple of games here, and one at Pennsic XV(?), but it sadly
didn't catch on.
   We did find that the lighter armored fighters (especially the ones wearing
running shoes) had to be evenly distributed between teams...

Greetings Gentles - 

  I have been following this discussion and would like to 
offer a different (maybe?) view.... It seems to me that it
is agreed upon fact that there were gay Kings of period.  
But even those who were "public" with this had an opposite-sex
Queen... I imagine that the intricacies of such a court 
along with the various "barbs" thrown back and forth must
have been spectacular.   Why not in the SCA?  I, personally,
don't see anything wrong with a gay King (or Queen) who,
during court occasions sit with a different-sex consort, but
during feasts is more often seen with their "lover" ... This
would needs be a "reign among friends" as some of the "discussions"
during that feast would over cook the meat! :-)

If the homosexual couple, like any heterosexual couple, decide to *choose* 
a different consort, that is fine.  But the point is, that homosexual couples,
like heterosexual couples, should have the option to *choose* instead of 
being told that they must have a friend for a consort instead of their SO. 
More applause to Jehanna (sp?) for cutting to the heart of the issue.  

On a similar note, I have a gay friend who is interested in the SCA, but has
been reticent to join because he does not want to be forced into the "mating
game", either.  If there are any other gay men in the society who have 
suggestions or stories about how they handled the SCA, please respond by
email.
