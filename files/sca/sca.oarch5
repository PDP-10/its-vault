Greetings & Felicitations!
 
  As a relative newcomr to the "net" I greet thee and apologize for not 
  including chapter & verse & folio reference for comments..

  (1)  Diversity -- I'm sorry, but when did the idea of participating in/at
       SCA events become such that it was to be banned to have a good time?
       When I joined the battle cry was "...as it Should Have Been!"  And
       part of this is such a diversity of having a mileau that is truly
       cosmopolitan.  
 
  (2)  books for documenting 1100 Ad -- I know there are many, many more out
       there, but the one  use the most, and that used to get borrowed the
       most, is :
              THE BOOK OF COSTUME
              Milla Davenport
              Crown Publishers, NY
              (c) 1948
              ISBN 0-517-037165
 
  (3)  Heralds -- I KNOW that the heralds are there to try to help, but some
       of them are SOOO officious it makes one want to lose one's cookies.  On
       the other hand, many, many more want and DO help.  But, as in all
       things, the daim-bramaged whackos get the most press.  On the OTHER
       hand, I found out last year that SOME twit decided that he/she/it did
       not like the way my device had been blazoned and recorded in the book
       of arms and has decided to rewrite it... I'll soon be working on
       trying to get it re-written BACK to what it wAs.  It was blazoned and
       PASSED in AS 9, and I did'nt even know my submission passed until I
       found that I had been given an AOA.  Coulda knocked me over with
       an houri's veil... So, it'S kinda sentimental for me...

   (4)  Secret Society -- I was caught by this secret society thing quite
       by surprise, as the msg on the original posting had been deleted from
       the node where I have access to the digest.  I now wonder what will
       ever become of it all.  MiLady Rebecca the Contrary, pray keep your
       spunk!  we need all of the spirit you can muster to the SCA at large.
 
  (5)  How I found the SCA-- I was visiting a friend at MIT (no, I was nae a
       student there) and a young lady bounced into me on the way out of his
       room.  At least a portion of her bounced..  most appealing was the
       excercise in static dynamics displayed as well..  I said to her:
       "pardon me, young lady!" (in what I hoped was an engaging tone of 
       smile) and SHE said "OH!  I don't know you -- but you must be going to 
       the event tonight!  I'll see you there!"  (and said she with HER most
       engaging tome of smile).  I later found out that she was CERTAIN that
       I had said "MiLAdy" rather than "Young Lady", And thAt the event was
       East Kingdom 12th night (or so I seem to recall).  I borrowed a
       surcoat, later met (again) the young lady, and hAd a merry old time.
       If there had been more folks there, I think I prob. would have not
       approached it (the SCA) at all, as I am actually a quite shy person.
       ('course, some say it would be better for all if I HAD declined to
       join..)
 
  (6)  entering into brewing contest -- in the OLDE DAYS of the SCA, I once
       had an inadvertant entry in a brewing contest.  I went to an "away"
       event with about 10 gallons of home-brewed apple cider.  I prevailed
       upon the kitcken staff to allow me to dirty one of their BIG pots so
       I could heat it up (the cider, not the staff) for consumption.  Well,
       I heated it, filled the jugs back up, went to get something in the
       hall and came back for the cider.  Well, one of the jugs was gone.
       I thought that somebody had either thrown it away or had placed it out
       of the way so it would'nt get broken.  Of COURSE the kitcken staff were
       all otherwhere.  I cleaned what I had borrowed and took my cider back to
       table for my friends and myself to enjoy.  Fine.  BUT, about when the
       awards were announced for the brewer's contest some of the kitcken 
       ffolks were pointing at my table and going "mrmr, murmr, MurMur.." to
       the king.  I thought to myself "But I *cleaned* the pot..".  THEN I was
       announced as to getting an honorary award for the contest -- the 
       contest I had'nt entered as I was sure that I could not compete (the
       fates will always prove ya rong..).  The cider had been whisked away
       to the head table as an entry...  roughly 4 months after that I was
       forced to GVAFIAte at the behest of a (now) ex-wife.  As a non-imbiber
       nowadays, I can only wish you Good Speed and may all yr bottles stay
       STRONG (try cleaning up a closet when 5 gallons of cider decide that
       its time to announce that it [the cider] has determined the strength
       of gas pressure required to overcome the crystalline matrix of it's
       enveloping container...)
 
  In service to the Dream,
     I remain,
        Yr O'b'nt S'rvnt,

Subject: Songs and stories

First, a response to Godfrey de Shipbrook-
In digest #217 you requested information on a song. The song you seek
is called "Catalan Veneance;" the words are by Moses ben Eldad to the
tune of "Spring Hill Mine Disaster." The song can be found in the
East Kingdom Song Book (now (temporarily) out of print). If you need
the words, I can send them to you privately (12 verses!).

My Lady Catrin-
If you are interested in the (dis)orders of amusement, perhaps some
here might like to relate stories of the Order of the Holy Passion.
This was (is?) a complete "religious" order, with cardinals (cardinal
what I won't say), fathers (...), and lay-brothers. There was a sister
order of course, "Our Lady of the Evening." Certain well-known
people rose (?) to some facinating positions in this order.

...Whatever...

Subject: How I met the SCA

--- Another post from my Wife....
 
<From: Mike Litchfield 'Flashback' <RML 3362 @ venus.tamu.edu>
<Lastly, I am curious as to how you gentles got involved in the Society.
 
I first heard about the SCA when a salesman came up to me in a store and said,
"You know, if you're interested in that, you may be interested in a group I
used to be in." I was interested but my schedule did not permit. (DARN!)
 
My second viewpoint on the SCA came from mentioning my interest to some
bookseller (non-SCA) friends of mine. They said, "You don't want to be in THAT
group. See that guy in the motorcycle and mercenary magazine section, the one
with the shaved head. HE is in the SCA!"  (How was I to know he was considered
fringe by other SCA folk?!) So I waited some more.
 
Then came (thank goodness!) the Demo at UNC-G's SF con. I met some very
inspirational and fun Atlantian gentles. (Thank you!) I decided I wanted to try
it for myself.
 
It wasn't always easy to pursue my interest initially. It was especially
difficult when, at my first event, a woman came up dressed in a poorly fitting,
poorly constructed, possibly Italian Renaissance gown and criticized me for not
lining my train. (Sigh! Well, she was probably feeling threatened and it was
the worst she could find to say about it.)
 
I didn't give up because I realized that:
1) this group offers unlimited opportunities for learning
2) it's full of talented, creative, caring, stable people who are joys to be
around
3) it gives a place to share what we do (and have perhaps been doing for years
with no one but relative/roommates to appreciate/critique it).
 
Those who may not at first be "joys to be around":
1) may be in earlier stages of "becoming" (give them time)
2) may just be different in the way they were brought up (give yourself time.
  These people often have a LOT to give.)
3) may have emotional problems or stresses of which you are unaware (give them
   time and understanding)
4) may be disagreeable persons with their own agendas (ignore or pity them.)
 
Not everyone will find a home in the SCA. Not all of us can be shining
examples. Hopefully those who are not yet in the SCA and those who are
fledgeling attendees will have patience with us.

Subject: "pikes" (archers)

Greetings to all the good fisherfolk of the SCA net. Having dusted off
the ashes from my flame-proof tunic, I would like to leave a *brief*
comment to those who are really concerned about whether pikemen or archers
can be said to have been the "mainstay" of the English army during
the hundred years war. Please note that I would direct this missive
directly to the other commenters involved with their quotes set out,
but I haven`t figured out how to do that yet-sorry.
     I certainly did not mean to downplay the admittedly critical
importance of English archery in this period. During this period,
the English army was characteristically ordered into groups called
"battles", usually three. Each battle consisted of a core of pikemen
flanked by archers on both sides. The French seem to have made a habit
of charging these battles with armored cavalry. Usually, the archers cut
down enemy horses, disrupting the charge, and the disordered attackers
were cut to pieces by pike units. When this did not work, the French 
chose the tactics of dismounting and charging on foot. This resulted
in some very tired, heavily armored chivalry being cut to pieces by
pikemen, especially when they charged uphill in the mud, as they did at
Agincourt. It was also their peculiar practice to place their Genoese
mercenary crossbowmen behind the cavalry, where they could not deprive
the chivalry of the glory of the kill! * a note for all warlords- THIS
DOES NOT WORK!* While archers were the primary cause of the disruption
of the charge, it was pikemen who killed most of the heavily armored types.
The purpose of the heavy armor of the period seems to have been to stop
arrows, which it did a great deal of the time. As far as the composition
of English (or French) forces at major battles, authorities differ wildly
on composition,size, and order of battle of the combatant forces.
   In conclusion, the English victories of the hundred years war were
accomplished not by archers or pikemen, but by both, working together
against a tactical concept that depended primarily on heavily armored
horsemen, and represents a major step in the demise of chivalry as
a sociopolitical and military power.

                                     Yours in Service,
                                     Li Kung Lo

Subject: Non-Europeans


Having just recieved a book called "The Medieval Expansion of Europe", I felt
compelled to throw in my two pennies worth on this subject. This book is a
fairly compressed treatise on how europeans interacted with people outside the
borders of nominal Europe in the years 1000-1500. The author (JRS Phillips)
has divided his subject thematically rather than chronologically. Typical
chapters are The Crusades, The Eastern Missions or European Merchants and The
East. 

I have only read about half the book right now, but it seems the most common 
form of contact was, not surprisingly, trade. There where well documented 
colonies of Italian merchants in Iran during the 1200'ds, for instance, and
there are traces of merchant enclaves in India and China as well as a non-
proved rumour about Genoese shipping in Indian Ocean from about the same time.
Marco Polo, of course, falls within this category.

A probable conclusion of this is that the opposite holds true, though this is
not mentioned in the book. But the mediteraenean (sp?), at least, must have 
seen a lot of Arabic merchants.

An other form of contact that is fairly well documented is that of envoys and 
missionaries. In the case of those sent by Christian kings and lords into Asia,
these were often monks filling both roles. There was even an Archbishop of
Peking, who lived and worked there for more than 25 years during the reign of 
Kublai. Examples of eastern envoys include several Mongols at various points 
in time, and one member of sect of the assasins who suggested that the worlds
of 'book religions' would unite to fight the Mongol scourge. He was rejected
with a few words about 'letting the beasts devour one another and then winning
Asia for Christianity'.

In my view this boils down to something very close to the official policy, ie
members of non-european cultures are to be accepted as long as they behave as
guests in a foreign (very foreign) country.

It could be noted that the likelihood of such a guest decreases dramaticly with
distance. Arabs, mongols, armenians etc are fairly easy to explain whereas
chinese or japanese would extremely unlikely. This, in my view, is not enough
for discrimination.

Another problem altogether is that of time traveling. What is I, a 7th century
swede, doing in front Prince Axel (A finn in 16th century garb)?And theres 800 
years between me and my Lady...

Yours, Lord Harabanar Hugilaikir

     Using the term 'eric' to refer to the edge of the lists is something
they do out West, I'm not sure exactly where.  I've read that this custom
got started way back around A.S. 0 ;-), and that there used to be THREE
different colors to mark this boundary: the White Russian, the Yellow Peril,
and Eric the Red.
     I've never heard of heralds being referred to as "fair witnesses," and
it seems fairly witless to me.  I react to this idea in the same way as to
the concept of a purple cow.  Heinlein isn't period, and I'm GLAD he isn't

     No, I didn't mean that!  I was just kidding!  Really!

     On the subject of sensible words vs. stupid words, I have found another
alternative word for the person in charge of an event: "symposiarch" (meaning
someone in charge of a symposium, which originally meant a drinking party).
     And the correct word for the person in charge of the food is, as always,
"cook." ;-)

Well, my first encounter was while I was driving to work...  I happened
to look out my window and see a horde of armoured people beating on each
other which, at that distance (and a lack of contact lenses), looked like
real swords.  I had heard of the SCA before, but the person who told me
about it moved away before I could get more information.  I said to myself,
"That must be the SCA, wish I didn't have to go to work!"

Upon arriving at work, a co-worker expressed her desire to work my shift,
so I guess perhaps sometimes wishes do come true.  :-)  Anyway, I tooled
on back to where I'd seen the fighting (House Rivendell), screwed my courage
to the sticking-place, and asked if it was, indeed, the SCA.  Which, indeed,
it was.

Well, that's *my* story, boring though it is...

Twas an interesting experience for me at my first event...
   I had gone to one meeting and a fighter practice and then my friends 

that had dragged me to the meeting and the practice told me that I 
was going to go to Autumn all thing with them a week later.  Talk about 
being dragged in.  I was a little skeptical at first since I did feel 
like I was being pulled head first into the SCA.  Though after the 
first even that changed.  I got there, changed into some hospitaller 
garb and was introduced around by the autocrat of the event who just 
so happened to be in my shire.  Needless to say, since my shire was 
hosting, I soon got dragged into the kitchen.  And was up all night 
helping prepare feastand breakfast for the next day.  Finally at about 
8am I went to bed and got a saxon wake up call at about 10am.  Needless 
to say I was upset.  Soon after that RUDE awakening, I got out of bed, 
watched the lyst that was going on and got into some of the activities. 
 They had a quest which started with some target archery, answering 

and making up riddles and drinking this whole horn of beer.  Then I 
went back to the cabin where... Oh lord... People were trying out all 
their brews.  Then came feast...  Feast was wonderful... Then I was 
soon dragged off to the bardic circle where everyone was STILL sampling 
their brews along with many mundane store-bought items.  I was soon 
flying... It got me to the point that I, Cameron the Stage Shy, got 
up there and sang.  I met many interesting people at this almost uneventful 
event and made a lot of friends.  Since then I have become more active 
though the shire that I am in is an hour south of me and I can't make 
it to meetings all the time since work coincides with the times that 
the meetings are.
I have since learned how to sew so I have been working on my own garb. 
 I no longer have the need for hospitallers.  And I am getting together 

armor so I will be able to fight more often.  And the one thing the 
SCA has taught me.... other than friendship... Is how to wear a skirt 
and that I actually dont mind dressing a little more feminine than 
previous.

Subject: joining the SCA

How I met the SCA... sneaking in through the back door, apparently.

When I was fairly newly single, a girlfriend kept telling me, "there's
this guy I know at work that you should meet.  You do aikido, he does
karate; he's really cool.  Only problem with him might be this wierd
medieval thing...."

At that point I knew what the SCA was through mentions in SF books --
author intros, etc.  -- but had never had any interest in checking it out.

What the heck; I went with her to one of his parties.  And there was
SINGING going on inside, and outside there was great high-energy DANCING,
and there were bunches of interesting people having FUN.  After several
such parties, I realized that the most interesting people all seemed to be
in the SCA; after that and after much converse with John Theophilous
Bofftist (who had become a close friend by this time), I decided to check
it out.

I was still dubious; this odd hobby obviously consumed lots of time and
energy and I was already busy all the time.  I went to a fighter practice,
and had pizza with the group after a local day event...found it pleasant
enough, to be sure, but nothing spectacular.

But if it's worth checking out, it's worth really checking out.  I found
a green polyester dress in a resale shop and went to March Crown (the first
Kingdom-level weekend outdoor event here), last year.

Total conversion experience!

Somehow it became perfectly inevitable that I would have fabric all over
the floor to re-create the garb of a knight of Santiago; and would haunt
bookstores and libraries for info on medieval Spain; and would have a
Mongolian yurt in my garage next to my mostly-finished sword and shield,
and have a large friendly DON'T PANIC constable's button on the dresser;
and that my car would magically acquire thousands of miles, and I would
magically acquire what-seemed-like-thousands of new friends and new
experiences; and that I would learn to somehow juggle three worlds,
mundania, aikido and SCA.

That's my story of meeting the SCA.  I have a related question for
all of you: how old were you when you joined?  I was 30 and had a full,
happy life already, and never expected to take all THIS on....

P.S.  Please don't ask why a Spanish lady camps in a Mongolian yurt.
I haven't the faintest idea how to work that into a persona story yet!
(All ideas will be gratefully considered.)

My first encounter with the SCA was at Pacificon (a gaming convention), but I
didn't join, because all I saw was fighting (which doesn't interest me).

A few years later, I went to a demo held by the local group at my college,
primarily because my suite-mate looked like a natural to join the SCA 
(actually, the SCA is too modern for her...she's a barbarian type).  Several
of my friends joined, and they eventually got me to go to an event.

I had a little trouble moving from Caid to the West (my local group in the West
didn't go to very many events), but otherwise have been in the SCA ever since.

Organized Cattle Thieves? But then everyone would know where
we kept our sheep! And you just keep your eyes open at next
pennsic... how can cattle theives "disband" if they were
never banded together in the first place. Branded maybe...

Subject: Heralds' duties
Message-Id: <Jan.17.13.24.31.1989.6046@ramones.rutgers.edu>


Greetings good gentles.

I have read the recent discussion of heralds and their duties with
interest.  The various points of view expressed have presented a range
of ideas, which I believe simply reflect the personal styles of the
individuals involved.  At this point, I would like to offer my own
thoughts.

I am currently Brigantia Principal Herald, herald to the King of the
East.  As such, the divided loyalties noted by several are
particularly significant to me.  I am the King's herald, and as such,
I am his servant.  I am also a Principal Herald, and as such, I am a
senior member of the College of Arms, and thus a deputy to the Laurel
Queen of Arms.  I have duties to both my lieges.  Indeed, when I swear
my oath of office to each new King, I always note that I will serve
only excepting my duties to the Laurel Queen.

In general, the duties of the herald are many.  We are responsible for
maintaining a registry of names and armory.  We are responsible for
setting standards for names and armory to be registered, for enforcing
those standards, and for providing educational material to anyone
interested in learning about armory and names.  We are responsible for
defining the proper usage of armory in the SCA, and for defining and
regulating the correct use of titles and rank in the Society.  We keep
the Order of Precedence, records of all awards given in the Kingdom.

The heralds are also the ceremonial officers of the Society.  We
organize and stage-manage Court. We research period ceremony and
maintain records of SCA ceremonies. 

The heralds are the public address system of the SCA, as anyone who
has attended any event knows very well.  However, this job is not just
bellowing.  At any large event, the heralds are the information
center, gathering and disseminating important information.  This
includes learning where everyone is so that they can be found in an
emergency.

All the duties of the herald which I have recited above are
duties of all heralds, from a pursuivant-at-large up through the
College of Arms and the Laurel Queen of Arms.

Much of the definition of the office of herald varies from place to
place and from individual to individual.  In some groups, the herald
serves as chatelaine, being the person who takes new members in hand
and explains what's going on.  In some groups, the herald organizes
tourneys.  

Many heralds take themselves far too seriously, especially when it
comes to the registry of names and armory.  This is a difficult and
often vexing process, and I quite understand the anger and frustration
many have built up over the years.  For some reason, which has yet to
be adequately explained, heraldry in the Society tends to attract many
people who are overly pushy, somewhat obnoxious, and much too sure of
themselves.  However, much of the bad press the heralds get is a
design feature.  We are, after all, the only office of the Society
which has the job of regularly telling people "No, you can't do that."
That is a difficult job, and it is an easy one to botch.  Lord Nils'
story from Pennsic is unfortunate, but I really think it points out
more that heralds are just people too, volunteering to do a very big
job.  Heraldic consulting at large events can be a disaster if it is
not well supervised, and Pennsic is the ultimate in confusion.  To
those who have lost faith in the College of Arms, I can only say:
Please try again.  We really are here to help, and we really do enjoy
helping.

Your friend and servant,

	Arval.

It appears that alt.sca has grown enough that we are reaching many
people who never heard of Lord Danulf's mailing list.  It also appears
that many of them don't actually get alt.sca, but rather are seeing
print outs & other digests through rather convoluted means.  So, some
information... 

There is a mailing list based in Boston which duplicates alt.sca.
There is a two-way gateway between alt.sca and this mailing list, so
(in theory, and almost always in practice) the content of the two are
identical.  Since the mailing list takes up alot of computer time
which Lord Danulf is getting for free, please don't subscribe to the
mailing list unless you have no other access to the net.


To subscribe, send email to SCA-REQUEST@mc.lcs.mit.edu, with the

2) SCA & mundane locations
3) titles, offices, etc.
4) brief summary of SCA interests
5) email address (ARPANET preferred)
6) Do you want to be added to the mailing list?
7) May your address be given out to other SCAfolk?

After I asked about the origins of the term "eric", I received the
following note from Lord Hal Ravn.  I thank him for his account.

---------------------

The story is a bit longer than you've given . . .

Back in the early days of the Society (when the West was the only kingdom),
some folks got together to make something to delimit the edge of the field.
(This would be in the year 1 or 2.)  What they had to hand was a lot
of red
fabric and some coat hangers.  Master Beverly Hodghead turned the coat
hangers into stakes and the Ladies made the fabric into strips,
hemmed, and
with pockets to hold the stakes.  From the color, it became known as
Eric the
Red.  Eventually Eric didn't enclose enough space, so in about the
year 4,
a second batch of cloth was turned into perimeter cloth.  This time, what
was available was yellow.  This strip became known as the Yellow Peril.
More time passed.  More field edging was needed.  The third set was made
from white fabric, and was known as the White Russian.  By this time, the
field edge was known collectively as 'the eric' and this has been true ever
since in the West, and probably in those Kingdoms that derive directly from
the West.

The authentication for the above history is due to my Lady--Mistress
Dorothea of Caer-Myrddin (The heralds can have a *lot* of fun looking
up her arms!)--who was one of those that made Eric the Red, together
with (if memory serves) Mistress Johanna von Griffenhurst, Mistress
Ellen Cross-Quills, and others.  I came into the Society around the
time that the Yellow Peril was made.

By-the-bye--I like your term 'Laurel Kingdoms.'

Y'r ob'd't servant,

Hal Ravn

Subject: Non-Europeans revisited
Message-ID: <890118005239.11.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

We must be aware that a debate about the propriety of non-European personas
touches directly on some people, namely those who have such personas. Many
of them have done considerable services to the SCA, and some of them are
peers. Any attempt to ban them would be gross ingratitude. Any attack on 
their personas *can* be interpreted as an attempt to drive them out of the
SCA. I'm sure we don't want that!

Conversely, someone recently wrote on this net (approximate quote): "If you
are troubled by the presence of non-European personas, you should probably
think of finding another group to get involved in." I take this to mean: "If
you don't like everything you see in the SCA, then buzz off!"

I don't accept this. I believe we must debate this subject because it's
important. It has to do with the very nature of the Society. So please, any
non-European gentles out there! Do not take offense, but I must speak of
what I think the SCA should be about. Perhaps this does not include your 
present persona, but there is nothing to say it couldn't include you.

Reading old copies of Tournaments Illuminated and other texts of the SCA,
I have never found even a hint at non-European cultures as subjects of study
in the SCA. There have been articles about oriental things, sure (western
Europeans in the middle Ages might have been curious about these things, too).
But the oriental things have always been side-lines and never in a definition
of what the Society is and does. All the official information I have ever
seen states very clearly that the Western European Middle Ages is the subject
we are interested in. *This* was the Dream of chivalry on which the Society
was founded.

It is my personal guess that when non-European personas first showed up,
they were tolerated on the theory that they were "visitors". But gradually,
they have become so many that they are changing the nature of this group.
The presence of large numbers of non-European personas is clearly in 
conflict with the idea of depicting the Age of Chivalry. If there was
only one or two, they wouldn't be a problem.

It's always easier to let people do as they please than to have rules and
enforce them. People love you if you say "Yes, go ahead!" and they get
angry if you say "No, you can't do that!". Strict rules to define what this
Society is about will undoubtedly alienate some people. But it is necessary
to have such rules. If we choose the easy way and let everyone do as he
pleases, the Dream will gradually be diluted until it becomes tasteless.
It is the limits that give us an identity. If we have none, the SCA will
become just a costumed version of the same confusing mash of different
cultures that mundane American society is.

I think it would be wonderful if there was a large society much like the
SCA, but with oriental cultures as its subject. The Society for Oriental
Anachronism, where Imperial Chinese and Japanese and other historic far-
Eastern cultures could be re-created. I might even join such a group. But
I would not want to see any Western Knights at my Japanese Tea Ceremony.
And I don't want to see Samurai at my 12th Century French court. To me, 
they are totally alien and out-of-place there. We might as well bring in
Donald Duck.

I really don't know how to solve this problem. It would seem very harsh to
try and force people to change their personas, but at the same time the
sight of all these out-of-place people is a constant pain. I can only say:
*Please* transform yourselves...

Subject: midieval {insert culture of choice}

All of this discussion brings me to one of my pet peeves in reference books.
That is: The_Penguin_Atlas_of_the_Ancient_World.  This volume goes from 
paleolithic to medieval periods *in*the*area*of*the*Mediterranean*.  This has
always bugged me (having had extended family from Sichuan).  Why do they 
say "the ancient world" when what they really mean is "the ancient known world
to our european ancestors cultural influences?"

Likewise, however, much as I balk at the usage, I believe that when a lot of 
people in the SCA say "medieval", they mean "medieval european."  The chinese
had a "warring states" period in *their* history; although there are certainly
periods of european history which have cognates (much of them in the middle
ages in europe :-) I am not sure that it would be meaningful to a chinese 
historian to make that comparison using the same label (i.e. referring to the
"warring states" period of west african or western european or central 
american history).

The basic point here is that we use "medieval" as a term to refer to europe,
but when we use it to refer to, say, Japan, we are using it as more of a
convenient metaphor.  The "medieval period" of Japan's history had different
roots, different culture, different ways of life and idioms of expression. 
There is a real lack of continuity to the culture of "medieval Japan" and the
same period of Chinese history, much less the history of Europe. 

Similarly, you wouldn't speak of "rennaisance japan" (the floating world?).  
The word medieval is used as a convenience, not as an idea of strict 
parallelism.

Subject: references, please?!?

Ah, c'mon guys.  I know there's SOMEONE out there who knows SOMETHING about
the history of sleeve styles and about a woman's daily life in the year 1100 
in Western Europe.  I feel like I'm shouting into a deep, dark hole - and 
not even getting an echo!

Maybe I should list some specific questions.  Ok, here goes ...

1.  When were sleeves first stitched to bodices?  Were they attached all
the way around, like modern sleeves?  When is tying the sleeve to the
bodice period?

2.  Was backstitching a known sewing technique?  When was it first
used?  What are the common stitches in period clothing?  What about
seams - which ones were most used in clothing construction?  Were
people familiar with the concept of easing the fabric by clipping?

3.  What did women do in daily life in 1100?  What kind of music did 
they listen to?  What kind of sewing would they do?  What would they
talk about - politics at all?  History?  Gossip?  How informed/superstitious
could they have been?  Would they read to each other in sewing circles?
(And when did that custom really start?)  Major references would be nice
for those questions.

4.  Can anyone recommend some good costume books?  I want stuff with
lots of detail.  

5.  Is anyone really out there, or is there just a program that creates
random messages on this list?  (That would explain some of the topic 
persistence. :-) )

Subject: How I Found the SCA

               How I Found the SCA

or, more accurately, how the SCA found me...

I don't remember my first contact - the first one I remember was while at
Georgetown University doing theater, a guy that had a part in the annual
big musical was talking about the SCA and brought in a dagger he had
recently acquired to show off.  I don't know why, but I had heard of the
group he was talking about somewhere, but I've never been able to figure
out where.

Several years later (3, to be exact) I was a theater major at the State
University of New York at Fredonia, where the girlfriend of one of my
coworkers was involved with "a bunch of people that are putting on a
Medieval event next spring", and was determined to have live music for
dancing.  Since we had talked a bit while hanging around the recording
studio, she knew I played recorder already, and so I was more or less
drafted.  Come spring, I borrowed a costume from the theater department,
dug out my trusty plastic Yamaha (german fingered) soprano recorder, and,
all by myself, played about a half dozen dances for the people at Ice
Dragon II at the (then) Shire of the Rhydderich Hael.  I decided this was
a bunch of weirdos that I liked, so I stuck around.  I haven't regretted
that decision yet, and an awful lot of my life now can be traced to
Arianna of Wynthrope talking me into "playing a little dance music" eleven
years ago.

Message-Id: <8901160119.AA08498@davids.UUCP>

I've got this lady friend who is interested in "joining up", so to speak.
She's got a couple of basic questions for which I can't answer the specifics.

One is about her persona.  She'd like to be .. an .. uhm .. er ..
Harlot, that's what it is.  Yeah!  Harlot!  Anyway, it's obvious that
harlotry, so to speak, is a period diversion.  But has anybody had
any experience with other people who've had, er .. harlot persona's?
Hmm.. maybe I'd better re-phrase that.... does anybody here have such
a persona or know of someone with such a persona?

The reason we're asking is that she's not sure of the general response.
I feel that it would fall under the "anything goes" attitude that people
usually have.  But can see where people might look down on it :-).  Which
is probably a period attitude in itself ... :-) :-)

The other has to do with musical instrument construction.  We were looking
at a Middle Kingdom Yellow Pages sheet that our chronicler sent out in
the local newsletter, and saw a box for that activity.  She's, uhm, *VERY*
interested in that subject ... again, can someone provide some pointers?
She's fairly adept with music as it is, especially with blowing horns.
She's apparently had this lifelong dream to build musical instruments ...

My lord, thou hast said a mouthful!  My own case, while not quite as
dramatic, illustrates the same point. (i.e. responsibility moves toward
newcommers as fast as to established members.)

I first heard about the SCA at an sf con called Darkover Grand Council
#9.  The SCA held a demo before the masquerade, arousing my curiosity no
end.  At the time, I was debating whether to major in Medievil or Japanese
history, and was taking a martial art (Aikido) which had some weapons
kata.  I approached the demonstrators and was directed, based on my
living in Princeton, to his excellency Pog O'mahion (excuse me, I mean
Pagan Mahon :).  The Baron answered all my questions, piqued my
curiosity, and gave me his number to contact him if I had any further
interest.
There the matter remained until the summer.  Regretably, the demands
of Junior independent work kept me from following up, and I probably
would never have gotten into it had I not accidently met an old
aquaintance, Dorigen, who had just moved to Princeton.   She gave me
Fiacha's number.  He was most helpful, and in September I finally
managed to get to my first event--the Lakewood Renfaire,
Well, two days later, I was Yaakov HaMizrachi and thouroughly commited
to the SCA.  The next month, we had a demo at Princeton. Throughout
the demo, people kept comming up to me and saying things like: "So,
when's the first meeting of the Princeton group?" To which I would
inevitably reply: "Princeton group? What Princeton group?" Turned
out that Fiacha had directed a number of folk to me in the expectation
that I, as the experienced SCA person around (!), would co-ordinate
things on campus.
Oddley enogh, this actually happened.

       to be members.  Even if they are (de-facto) members by the grace of
       being a reader/responder of the communications here in the net. 
       Sometimes things HAVE to be spelled out.  it'S no good saying that
       you think it's intuitivly obvious, because sometimes matters are
       not so.
 
       I work (within the mundane world) as a systems programmer for IBM
       mainframes, and in that capacity I am oft called upon to attempt to
       clarify what are, to me, perfectly ordinary and common items.  I am
       often taken aback at what I consider commonplace and basic to be
       seen as esoteric and obscure.  The point?  Never assume that
       the idea will not be misconstrued.  A gentle earlier hereafore noted
       that EVERYTHING will offend SOMEBODY "out there."
 
  (2)  I was, ages ago, a member of the SCA and GAFIAted for almost 10 years
       at the insistance of a (now ex-) wife.  I remember the term that was
       used to refer to members of our participation in the dream as
       "SCA-ers" and find the use of "SCAins" as somewhat jarring.  But it
       seems all the fashon.  perhaps none will take offense if I retain
       my use of the phrasing "SCAer?"  Also, the term "mundane" was used,
       without perjoration, to simply refer to one who did not participate
       with us in the dream we tried to evoke.  I find some real distress
       in the fact that many are seing the non-SCAer as something other than
       a person who simply has a different set of interests.  There is
       nothing at all wromg with one who does not share our dream.  After
       all, WE very likely do not share THEIR'S.  I Pray that I do not fall
       into that usage.
 
  (3)  I find the usage of this forum to be a grand thing, and applaud the
       effort to try to find the common ground betwixt our kingdoms and our
       diverse objects.  "VIVAT" or "HUZZAH" or "POO-BAH" or whatever.  I
       confess, i First thought of Gilbert & Sillyman when I Heard the shout
       "POO-BA"  (as in "grand poobah").
     
       In fact, the idea of an SCA-oriented forum upon a nationwide (and,
       yes, international) milleau is long overdue.  In point of other fact,
       (and here I get to plug my own smoothbore & sell my own bonds) I have 
       been moderating such a forum on one of the commercial on-line 
       networks for just about two years now.  The net is specific for
       Commodore 64 and Commodore 128 users and is known as
       Quantum-Link.  If you are a Commodore user, and use Quantum}link,
       or know of othrs who are also on Q-Link, but perhaps do not know of our
       existance there, mayhaps thee could inform them.  All are welcome,
       And I try my best not to mislead newcomers, or those interested in 
       trying out our dream firsthand.  As I rely upon the addresses and
       names published in the kingdom newslettres to inform these potential
       gentles I wish to place a plea for all to make sure that local address
       and contact names are accurate.
 
        Ah, yes, it would likely be helpful to provide a Q-Link contact...
        I am known, upon Q-Link, as "SIGNIGRLPH".  The SCA "room" opens in
        a public room in PEople-Connection, known As "SCA", Eaxh tuesday
        evening from 10:00 PM (EastRealm time) until approx Midnight.  There

	The problem with this is that a surprising *large* number

a month, twice at the most, I'll summarize these into what, where,

trick is, if your event has something special about it, LET ME KNOW.
There are currently provisions for one (1) line of info about happenings
at the event.  If your event has something special about it, it could 
get a few more.

	Since we ussually know about events well in advance, sending off
a quick note to this service with the minimum information shouldn't
be much of a strain on you prospective autocrats.  And it lets us have
an event notice posting.  I'm looking forward to seeing the responce...

Wes ge hale!

Are there any gentles on the net who know something about those groups
who fight with metal weapons?

There are such groups in Britain, but as far as I know they only perform
coreographed show fights, not real combat. I have also heard that there
are some metal weapons groups in Australia, and that these really do
fight. According to my source (an Australian lady who called them "mid'l
wip'ns gruups"), they use a sort of chainmail armor with soldered links.

It would be interesting to find out 

a.) if there are any groups who really FIGHT with metal weapons,
b.) how they manage to survive (or else, how they pay for all the funerals),
c.) how soldered chainmail is made,
d.) where these groups are located.

Thank you.

Subject: How I met the SCA
Message-ID: <890117002620.25.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

A few words in response to Lord Justin's query about how people
got into the SCA:
 
I first heard of the Society in 1976, I believe it was the ad in 
"Runequest" (a roleplaying game) that caught my attention. At about
the same time, a woman named Bonnie GoodKnight of the Mythopoeic
Society was in Sweden and mentioned the SCA in a lecture on American
Tolkienism and fantasy groups.

I was hevily involved in Swedish Tolkien groups at the time and
dycided I did not want to start an SCA group here because it might
compete with those groups. I wrote to the SCA however, and got a
copy of TI and some info from Eriod of Eire.

Finally, in 1984 I decided that I had grown tired of the Tolkien
stuff and that the time was ripe to start a medieval group. So I
sent in my dollars. I had never attended an SCA event or even met
anyone who was a member. I just knew that this was a big, impres-
sive medieval group, and I wanted to have the same thing in Sweden.

It turned out that eight guys in Stockholm were having the same 
idea and had also sent in their money at about the same time (as
a matter of fact, I got in touch with them via a computer network!).
And thus was the Barony of Nordmark created.

Some of you may remember Eirik as "Arthur" the King of An Tir at TYC.

Eirik and Meagan have chosen to do a Celtic reign - the low stage covered
in skins, their own celtic thrones, and a ceremony written by Master Gerhard

This continued through the War of the Roses, actually. Several important
battles were decided because the winning general used his archers more
effectively, and at least one was lost because the commander raised his
visor and caught 5 arrows in the face, demoralizing his army.

[ Danger, danger... This is from memory! I no longer have access to the
  sources and I may misremember fine points. I'm fairly sure of the big
  picture though. (Boy, howdy! Do I miss the Michigan State U. library.)
  END DISCLAIMER ]

All non-noble Englishmen, with a very few exceptions, were required to
practice at the butts two or three times a week (it changed depending on
hostilities, population, and production needs) by law.  There was also a
set number of shots per practice that changed from time to time.

These laws were enforced from, I believe, Edward II's reign through Henry VIII.
Edward conceived of the idea after a Welsh uprising when the Welsh longbow
was striking from out of range of the English (short) bows with amazing
power. Years later, one chronicler remarked on the 4 arrows in an oaken
door with their points showing on the inside, left as a reminder of the bow's
power.

The mandatory practice, along with pulling to the cheek instead of the chest
(improves accuracy and power), produced one of the greatest forces of the
Middle Ages. The armored cavalry and foot supported the archers as much as
vice versa. Two bits of irony, the foot were often _Welsh_ pikemen, and the
strength of the yoeman class caused immense social change for the warrior
class that required them to practice.

As Diablu says elsewhere, football (soccer in the US or Fi'baa in Glasgow :-)
was banned because it interfered with archery practice. Other laws imposed
heavy penalties and tariffs on merchandise shipped from certain countries
unless accompanied by a set number of yew staves (in 1370-ish it was 4 or 5
per barrel of wine from one country).  It also led to enforcement problems
for gameskeepers, so that having arrows with a hunting head was as damning
as being found dressing a kill, both were hanging offenses.

Other countries were changed as well. The depopulation of the land between
Aquitaine and France hurt the French for years after the ouster of the
English. The imposed import of yew contributed to the second defoliation of
Greece. The Spanish destroyed all the yew they could after the Black
Prince's campaign, so that Spanish trees would not be used to kill Spanish
knight ever again.  This is a subject, and time, I find fascinating. If you
have read Tuchman's _A_Distant_Mirror_ you have scratched the surface.

As for the comment that started this, I recall that the English used bill
(English) and pike (Welsh) units with similar discipline as the archers. The
Archers also carried a back up weapon for when they ran out of arrows or the
action broke up enough to go for prisoners (spelled ransom) and loot. One
source...

(Arggg! George, send me the list of books under archery, bow and
arrow, and any related topics from the MSU library. I'll get them from NYC
or interlibrary loan. This is bugging me! Sorry folks, where was I? Ummmm,
oh, yea.)

One source makes reference to a "short bill" carried by archers. It was
mainly used to unhorse a knight by getting him in a lightly armored area
when he stood in his stirrups to strike with his sword. A fundamental wound,
as it were. (Sorry about that, too ;-)

And on that note, I think that is more than enough for now.

   MALICE:!!!   I tried to write you but you were right.  Our computer has 
     no icea what isis is and I don't know any other possible ways.

   Thanks:   For the encouraging notes about having my feast site pulled out
    from under me two weeks before the event and the information about beads.
    If anybody has a need for wooden beads, I've got a line on where you could
    get quite a few small ones cheaply ;-).

  Heralds:  I'm not sure really, whether I understand this argument or not.
   I have the idea that some people think heralds only have to report to their
   seneschal or the college of arms or some such problem but could someone 
   perhaps e-mail me and re-explain the debate?

  Cooking:  Our shire has managed to keep people coming to meetings through
   a potluck held every month and it always seems that there's plenty of meat 
   plenty of bread, some rice and a few odds and ends (cheese etc).  I've 
   been looking through cookbooks and haven't found much in the way on how
   to prepare veggies.  Oh, there's the beets, the cabbage, the glazed car-
   rots and armored turnips, but I don't remember many studies in the variety
   ways to prepare different vegetables.  Does anybody have any ideas about
   this?

Subject: Heralds

In response to Lord Taran of Windy Hill's recent posting....
Lord Taran's long and distinguished tenure as Golden Gryphon Pursuivant was
preceded by a fellow now known as the Firebrand Herald Extraordinary, and he
likes to think that waht he got his AoA for was rekindling a glimmer of
interest in heraldry in the Barony. I assumed the office from someone who took
it out of "insufficient reluctance" and *her* predecessor took it only because a
barony had to have this evil and someone had to do it. Halfway through my
tenure, there were twelve deputy pursuivants in Carolingia. Nevertheless, it
does show that even in such an active group, heraldry can get a bad rep. Why?
Probably because we're seen as the ones trying to spoil everyone's fun. One of
the duties -- if not most of them -- with which the CoA is charged boils down
to maintaing the integrity of the SCA as a medieval organization, which is why
heralds are at the forefront of the "Just What is the SCA Here For?" and "Just
What Does 'Medieval' Mean, Anyway" debates.
In reviewing the 2nd and 4th drafts of the Corpora revision, I pointed out
that Corpora doesn't say anything at all about the CoA's duties regarding
field heraldry and ceremonial. Lady Laurel, apparently agrees with the Corpora
revision's definition. Certainly the CoA is more than a registry...we should
be (and are) engaged in research regarding period ceremonial and court
protocol, the condduct of tournaments, etc. as well as armory. Corpora
relegates that to a secondary duty of the various kngdoms' Colleges of
Heralds. *I* think it's the heralds' *primary* duty.

  This happened to me too -- I knew a guy whose parents had a couple
of suits of armor and some neat-looking swords, and I'd heard about
these people who dressed up and had "swordfights" in a local park
about five years before I knew that they were part of the SCA.

  I'll add a story.  My first encounter with the SCA was very much like
Justin's, except that the demo was outdoors the weekend after the "activity
fair" (they only had a few people there, and spent most of their time
just telling people when the *real* demo was).  The interesting part
began at the demo when I was introduced to a *very* good looking baron,
who invited me to the party they were having that night, and even offered
to give me a ride.  By the next morning (:-), I was officially going out
with (gawd I hate that term, but I don't know how else to explain it) him.

  Then the real fun started.  Coronation was about two weeks away, and
*everyone* was going because the crown princess lived in our barony.
So there I was, with no garb, only a faint idea of how this whole thing
worked, and going to a major event with a well-known baron in a couple
of weeks.  They drilled me on ettiquette, found me a dress to borrow,
and told me not to worry about anything else (crash space & stuff was
already arranged).

  The event was almost a disaster for me -- the baron deserted me to
spend time with his friends, I got yelled at for not recognizing the
king (he wasn't wearing his crown, so how was I supposed to know who
he was?), court confused the hell out of me, and by the end of dinner,
I wanted to go home.  Then a knight from our barony saw me sitting
there alone, said the baron was a jerk, and introduced me to what seemed
like everyone at the event.  I spent the rest of the evening flirting
with three knights out on the patio, and decided that this group wasn't
so bad after all ;-).

  That all happened a while ago, and I lost interest in the SCA a short
time after I moved back to NJ.  People didn't like me because I was friends
with people they didn't like, and it just wasn't fun anymore.  But now
that I want to get involved again, I don't even know what barony I'm in,
where they get together, or who to talk to about it around here.  So if
someone would be kind enough to give me some of that information (I live
in Berkeley Heights, NJ), maybe I'll see some of you at an event before
too long!  Now where did I hide all of that old garb...

Subject: Another herald's viewpoint

Good Gentles:

     If I may add on to what Lord Taran of Windy Hill said in digest 215 re:
heralds and their role/loyalties.  First, let me state that I served as 
Carolingian pursuivant immediately after Taran and was trained by him as well
so my bias is similar.  As a baronial pursuivant I felt that my primary
responsibility was to my Baron  (as I spoke 'with his voice')  My next 
obligation was to other members of the barony in so far as helping with
heraldic design, name selection but more importantly (as I see it) making
court and tourneyments as interesting and enjoyable as possible for non-
participants.  I consider myself to be a competent book herald but feel that 
my heraldic strengths lie in court and field heraldry, two aspects of the
subject which I feel are too often ignored by the College of Arms.

I remain in service to good heraldry, low flaming, and lots of fun

       My thanks to Lord Taran for his posting about heraldry. I often tell
people I became a marshall so I could get away with my comments about
marshalling. Being not a herald myself, I have been somewhat reluctant to make
many public comments. However, his posting seems to show a sincere interest in
service to the system. Someone else's question suggested that there weren't
problems with heraldry. It also looked like the discussion was going to be over,
and thus am I emboldened to post.

     Flaming commentary it may be, from a non-herald, but, hey, I don't post
much.

     I had help from a local herald in creating my device. I checked it through
Papworth's and the SCA armorial. For diverse and personal reasons I did not send
it through the normal system, but tried to submit it at the heraldry tent at the
Pennsic War. It sounded efficient to go straight through without themail in the
way. Actually I tried a couple of years in a row, but met the same thing each
time. No one ever insisted anything was actually wrong with it, maybe I could
have handled it if there was. What I hadn't prepared for was TAG TEAM HERALDRY.
      It was amazing! These guys sounded like they were talking about something,
but they were talking in circles. It went on for what must have been hours. When
one of them got tired, or when it got to be dinner time another would step in. I
just gave up eventually. My best guess is that they enjoyed feeling important,
or that I was supposed to register their device, not mine.
      Now when I go past the heraldry tent at the war I look in at astonished
faces of the applicants. Sometimes I have found an opportunity to comfort the
bewildered. As for my device, I carry it on my banner. Maybe it would pass. If
the college submits it to me we will see. I'm not holding my breath.

     OK, sorry sorry, I was impolite. Heraldry can be interesting and fun. There
are no heralds around here that I actually dislike, and many have been helpful.
I just got a little carried away, and I happen to no longer be interested in
submitting my device.

**************** WARNING ****************
The following may be considered by some to be the flamings of a sexist pig. So
be it.

"Confraternity" was, to my knowledge, first used by Mistress Moira Maureen ua'
Seamus, then Triton Herald, to describe the sub-group of Atlantian heralds
within the Eastrealm College of Heralds. As Brigantia Principal Herald, I
extended the term to any local commenting/heraldic-interest group. When these
groups began to proliferate under the current Brigantia, I suggested the term
be used as the standard for this sort of group, to avoid cutesy-poo things
like "the Dragonship Haven Heraldic Assault Team" and the "Carolingian High
School of Heralds". The word precisely describe the entity. Another word might
be "sodality" but that has ecclesiatical connotations. I think that those who
are offended by the word "confraternity" are taking themselves a bit too
seriously, and I'll be $%^&^%%$-ed if I'll call it a con-person-ernity. I
don't have time to rewrite the English language.

Subject: Re: the moral question

This is not, repeat, not a *moral* question.  If it is anything, it is simply
a matter of not having (to use a business term) an undefined mission.  If Eric
feels that the mission *is* well-defined, then the problem lies only in not
keeping the organization on track.  
 
Don't turn anyone away.  It is entirely unnecessry that anyone be so turned. 
However, it is entirely within the province of a Guildmaster, and Eric is one,
no matter how *Incipient* (thank you Alex, my apologies Eric)  to keep the
business of a guild meeting on the track of the business of the Guild.  The
Demo Committee members may flame occasionally over something not to do with
Demos, someone in a Heralds' commenting session may speak of field heralds, a
Masonic member may speak of politics at Lodge (a no-no) but in each case the
discussion is brought back on track by those in charge.

I guess that I am agreeing with Alex, but only if by his comment about
announcing loudle at the next meeting, he means the next Guild meeting.  If he
means anything else, he is wrong.  The Incipient Guild needs to create a
strong mission statement, strong enough, for instance, that I as Magister can
tell a new or transfer member *exactly* what the Bards' Guild is and does.

Eric, your Guild may or may not be a fine and necessary response to an
unfulfilled need in Carolingia.  You, time, and the Barony will decide that. 
But until the business of the Guild, its methods, purposes, and rituals (if
you want to term them that) are defined so that everyone understands them, you
*will* continue to be an unspeciallized forum for all those whose haven't been
able to fit in satisfactorily with some other Guild.

Subject: Re: Non-European Personas

Unto Lord Kwellend Njal doth Lord Li Kung Lo send warmest greetings
this ninth of January, A.S.23.
I really appreciate your kind comments supporting my non-European
persona. I joined the society in A.S.18, with no knowledge of what
I was doing. I was told at that time that Asian personae were OK,
but if I had known then the considerable opposition to such, I might
very well have chickened out and become a generic Saxon. My long
association with mundane Asian martial arts provided me with the
only garb I had that looked "old", so here I am. By the time I
realized that many purists object to Chinese persona, I was already
a well known persona in the East. While I am a registered nurse now,
I have a B.A. in Anthropology, and worked for some time as a state
archeologist in New York. My studies of the process of acculturation
made me ask what accomadations a Chinese person would have to make
in 13th century Europe to survive. I picked the 13th century because
it represents the golden age of Shaolin temple in Hunan, but my
later studies on European history indicated that it was an ideal
time for Li Kung Lo to make the transition to Europe. It marks a 
post-crusades period where many new goods and concepts were being
introduced to Europe, and where trade routes,both by land and sea,
between Cathay (the middle kingdom) and the holy land were already
well established. Later I became an RN, and service to the society
as a chirurgeon became inevitable. This provided me with a niche
in European society. When I was granted arms, it was simple to concoct
a story of how I had served the crown as a chirurgeon. Later I
became squire to a British earl in France, who`s period is not that
far off from my own, and I finally became what I had been trained in
Hunan to be... a military officer!
    The point is that some of us with non-european personae have been
around a long time, and a few of us have managed to win the fight for
acceptance by the mainstream of the SCA. However, about the time that 
people start to say how well your persona is done, you discover that
natural accomadation is starting to make you more European. My
persona is well developed *because* I`ve had to defend it since the
day I attended my first event! In conclusion, I thank you again for
your support, and remind you that a persona is not a static thing,
but a *living* thing that changes and grows. Any persona, but most
especially a visitor/ambassador, must not be so rigid that it is
unaffected by the society around him/her.

Subject: non-European personae

Unto the honorable fisher-folk of the net doth Li Kung Lo send warmest
greetings this ninth of January, A.S. 23. It seems that my reply to
Steffan prompted much interest on the net, and I have been pleased and
surprised by the many responses that have appeared in my mailbox,
largely supportive. While my earlier letter concerned the history of
Li Kung Lo, I feel that a summary of the development of this persona
within the SCA is relevent to the ongoing discussion of non-European
personae. 
    When I went to my first SCA event, I was told to wear something
that looked "old". My long association with mundane Asian martial
arts, both Chinese and Japanese, provided me with the closest thing
I had, so here I am. I was told at the time that Asian personae were
"OK". If I had known then the extent of opposition to Asian personae
in the rank-and-file of the SCA, or if there had been a golden key
in my incipient shire, perhaps I would have chickened out and become
a generic Saxon or Scot.
   By the time I realized that my persona was a tad irregular, I was
already a well established person in the East. Later, I was told
that I was supposed to be a visitor or ambassador. I had chosen the
13th century because it represents the golden age of Shaol`in temple
in Hunan, where Li Kung Lo received his military training. My later
studies in European history indicated that this was a good choice, as
this was the post-crusades era in Europe. Many new goods and concepts
were being introduced to Europe, and regular trade routes, both by
land and sea, between Cathay (the middle kingdom) and the holy land were
already well established.
   At the time, I was a senior nursing student, but my BA is in 
anthropology, and I had been working as a state archeologist in New York.
My studies in acculturation made me ask what accomadations a Chinese
person would have to make to survive in 13th century Europe, and the
odyssey of Li Kung Lo was begun. Remember, I was commited to playing
the son of a concubine/slave and a mandarin, who was persecuted by
the local children, and sent to a monastary for military training, to
get him out of the way. He was dealt with formally and harshly by the
priests of Shaol'in, and then became a renegade exile because he did
what he was *supposed* to do!
   Given what I knew about Chinese chauvanismm, the mandarin class, and
Taoist theocrats, it was a reasonable assumption that Li Kung Lo had
never had a real friend in his life, and was probably an arrogant SOB,
and that is just how I played him. For the longest time, the good gentles
of the SCA thought that my persona was the real me, and boy, was I ever
mistreated! As an RN, it became inevitable that I would come to serve
the society as a chirurgeon, and that, at least, gave me the opporunity
to be myself, and not my persona, and I made a few friends.
   As time went on, events in the society caused me to begin to acculturate
the persona. First, the crown awarded me arms, largely for my
service as a chirurgeon, and it was simple to concoct a story about how
I had served the crown in that capacity. This required me to start
acting like a European lord, which was *very* difficult. Later, 
I became a squire to a British earl in France, and finally became what
I was trained at Shaol`in to be, a military officer! This gives me
a convenient excuse to indulge myself in chivalry; I can always say that
my liege commands it. I converted, at least nominally, to the Christian
faith. About this time, I was mundanely married to a wonderful lady
with a French basque persona, Cynthia du pres Argent. This was a problem
from a persona point of view. These basques let women sit on village
councils and the like, while Li Kung Lo comes from a society that was
arguably the most oppressive of women ever to exist on Earth. 
   We concocted a wonderful story of how I carried her off while leading
a group of British troops on a foray in the pyrenees, and my liege,
much to my chagrin, ordered me to marry her to save my immortal soul,
as a lesson in proper christian/knightly behavior. She claims my men
unlawfully killed her sheep, and refers to me as "sheep killer".
I claim her *black* sheep (demon familiars) attempted to protect her,
and that she is, no doubt, a witch! (to all religious fanatics,this is
a joke, A JOKE!)
   In conclusion, I would like to say first, that some of us "visitors"
have been here a long time. We were told we could do this when we
joined, so please don`t persecute or ostracize us. Secondly, remember
that a persona is a living, growing thing, and should never be so rigid
that it is not affected by the society in which it exists. (where did
all you "Europeans" learn to eat with chopsticks, anyway?) Finally, to
all those supportive people who have told me my persona is well done,
remember that that is because I`ve had to defend it since the first 
event I attended!

sends all good greetings unto the Rialto:

     For the gentle who requested, and also others new to brewing-

     To enter your home brew in a competition, simply bring a bottle.
It is preferable that the bottle be labeled, and you should be able to
provide the following information about your brew: what did you put in it,
when was it bottled, did you add anything during the fermenting process,
and what did you INTEND the flavor to be.  Also, don't expect to get any
of that bottle back; you may wish to bring more to share with other brewers
after the competition is over.

     I attended a competition at this Pensic, and there were catagories
for mead, white wine, red wine, rose, desert liquers, and various types
of beer and ale.

     **FLAME ON** I heard comments from the judges like "This wine in only
a year old - why did you even bother to bring it?" and "You haven't got
berry liquer here - you've got PANCAKE SYRUP! Why did you even bother to
bring it?"  I hope you run in to better judges.  **FLAME OFF**

     "May your bottles never break."

Subject: How I met the SCA...

Ah, yes; the value of NOISE at a demo...

Once upon a time, I was wandering through my College Activity Fair (a great
gathering where every club in the school gets one table in their quest to
convince everyone that theirs is the finest club in the land), a naive
freshman with no idea of how to spend his time.

Suddenly, a loud "CLANG" arose from a corner. My curiosity piqued, I went
over to see what was making the noise. There, behind a table, was the then-
president of the Brandeis Medieval Society -- hitting his fiancee over the
head with a stick. Of course, she had a helm on. After a suitably large
crowd had been attracted, Nikolai (as I learned he was named) went into
the usual spiel about chivalry and stuff. "Boy," thought I, "this is *weird*".
But it was interesting weird, so I signed up for the first meeting.

Three months later, Nikolai having returned to the West, I was the bleeding
Seneschal. One thing I'll say for the SCA: it sucks you in fast and hard.

On a related note:

At a meeting of the Carolingian Philosophers a while back, we went around
the room asking this question. One thing that we were somewhat surprised
to discover was that almost everyone there had had contact with the Society
at least once before the contact that pulled them in.

For example, in High School, my friend Frank Chut disappeared for one
weekend, and came back blathering about this group he'd gone camping with
where people would get in armor, and go out on the field, and hit each other 
with these sticks, only they weren't sticks, they were sort of like bamboo, 
and gosh, was it *fun*!

I decided Frank had gone off the deep end, and mentally added these weird
people in armor to my list of groups to whole-heartedly avoid. 

After being in the SCA for three years, in the middle of my second term as
Provost of my college group, I suddenly remembered this incident. If nothing
else, it does prove that different people can see very different merits in
the same group...

So, does anyone else have similar stories about their *first* encounters
with those strange people in funny clothes?

Subject: College Groups

One possible alternative --

The Carolingian method of dealing with college groups is to make them into
"burroughs" (spelt however one feels like it). A burrough is a completely
unofficial entity as far as the Society is concerned, although it is
official on the Baronial level (each burrough holds one seat on the 
Baronial Great Council, and generally has a structure much like that of
an official SCA group).

The advantages of this structure include having less paperwork to fill
out, and not having to deal with maintaining sufficient membership levels
for a canton. Also, some colleges are touchy about funding groups that are
official branches of national organizations (Wellesley is particularly
bad about this at the moment); this makes it easier to get around such
restrictions. The disadvantages are relatively minor (such as not being
allowed to use the SCA group charge (the laurel wreath) on the group's
badge).

Of course, I am a bit of an anarchist where the Society is concerned, so
consider my views biased. Still, I headed one of these groups for about
two years, and it was *very* nice not having to worry about SCA
bureaucracy as well as the college's own.

I strongly recommend having regular, frequent group meetings, and advertising
them as heavily as possible, even if you don't have much to talk about.
At worst, you sit around and shoot the breeze for an hour or two; at best,
you get a few drop-ins to recruit. Meeting once a week is not too often,
and once a month is a bare minimum.

I also suggest putting recuitment in as an important activity. By the
nature of college groups, you're going to start seeing attrition before
too long. A healthy college group should try to recruit at least 3 or 4
new core members from each class, and pass the reins of power on to them
well before the current crop is about to graduate. 

Feel free to ask more specific questions by e-mail; this is one of my
favorite topics...

I would like to note that at least one recent addition to Ealdormere
(a) has used the toast for 12 years; (b) persists in using it in non-SCA
contexts; and (c) has used his pewter bowl charged with toast more often
at non-SCA meetings & parties than at events, principally at New Year's
Eve and various Morris Dancing celebrations.

My way has been derived over the years from a number of sources that can
only approximate the original usage.  After charging the bowl and
briefly stating my pledge (usually innocuous, such as good health to
all, but occasionally a battle promise) I salute.  After sipping, the
bowl is passed counter-clockwise, and all who seek to share the wish or
promise then reply and drink.  When it returns (etiquette enters here)
the toaster then drains the bowl, and as proof eats the toast floating
in it.

Since my bowl holds a couple of litres of strong ale, I usually get a
thirsty friend or two as anchor on my left; this is important, because
sometimes other people want to propose toasts, and it's necessary to
leave some capacity out of politeness.  At least once, however, a
conspiracy required me to belt down most of the contents, etiquette once
again demanding a single draught (i.e., no taking breaths).  It rarely
turns into a drinkfest, though, and typically is one of those binding,
communal moments people remember for a little while.

The first time I *heard* about SCA was in Larry Niven's story, "The 
Cloak of Anarchy", but the reference was very fleeting and I didn't think
anything about it.  The second time was at Rivercon (Louisville,KY) 
back in '79 or '80.  There was a note posted on a Bulletin board asking
if people were interested in fencing.  I and a few friends I had with me
had fenced, so I called one over.  A passer-by noted our interest, said,
"Oh, that's the SCA." in decided negative tones, and went on.  We had to 
get to a program and never did make it up the room on the note.

Finally a friend and I made it to the small event in Dallas that I mentioned
before.  There we happened to start talking to one gentle (chosen by virtue
of his being closest to the spot we parked the car) who happened to be a 
visitor from Lubbock.  The idea that this guy had driven 7 hours to be
there impressed us, and we spent most of the rest of the afternoon talking
to him (Squire Vallost Balstein, I *think*, I'm sure I'm mutilating
his name everyway but phonetically) about how he had gotten involved while
stationed on the Nimitz (the shire of Currach Mor) and was just getting
involved again after leaving the Navy.  After that I was hooked.

My Lady (she may be my Ex, but she's still my Lady) had her first contact
via me.  Two days after we got involved with each other she went home to
visit her family.  It was quickly announced that she had a boyfriend, and
she was asked to tell them about me.  And of course the first thing she
could think of was to try and describe SCA to them.  Which, from the way
she told it was:  "Well, he makes his own medieval armor and hits people
with wooden swords..."  They liked me in spite of that...  :-)

Subject: Non-European Personas

From my Lady Kateryne:
 
I have been following this discussion with interest and decided to add my
tuppence worth. (Elizabeth, at least it's shorter than my letters!)
 
I have very mixed feelings about non-European personas.
 
At most events I have felt that the presence of some Non-Europeans were
glaringly inappropriate. The more flashy of them struck me as costumes
appropriate to the Mask or the stage (which in my time is called Fancy Dress).
Some have reminded me of the poor wretches who were brought like animals in
the menagerie to show us what lives in the New World found by that fellow who
was funded by the Spanish Queen Isabella. (Or those poor souls in small
amounts of fur who seem to be alternately burnt to brilliant and painful red or
frozen to a purplish blue color.)
 
With some persons I have felt as if they disdained "playing the game by the
rules". Others have seemed to choose non-European personas because they can
seem knowledgeable without putting forth the same effort required to have a
Tudor (or Norman or...) persona that is novel and noteworthy.(Perhaps some of
my reservations about non-Europeans have come about because of the arrogance of
some of the non-Europeans I have gotten to know.)
 
The SCA's stated "area of study" (of pre-seventeenth century Europe and the
cultures which had realistic contact) give an extraordinary variety of cultures
and costumes from which to choose. In fact, the choices are so broad that it is
not possible for a single person to truly exhaust them. I know of several
people who feel it should be further limited to exclude the Renaissance. (Good
luck on trying that one!) One of our Dukes has publicly stated that he thinks
we should limit ourselves to the Viking Age. (?!?!?) (One of the jokes in An
Tir is that you have to be Norse to win the throne now.) 
 
On the other hand, I have been to some wonderful theme events. The most recent
example was Lionsgate Baronial Banquet whose theme was the Indian Sub-continent.
It gave me an opportunity to trot out one of my several Sarees. I learned that
some of the Micronesian dance costumes look VERY much like American and West
Indian costumes. (No wonder Columbus was confused!) And I got to eat more
Indian food at one sitting than was probably healthy for me. (But it was SOOO
good!) (It was worth the 7 hour drive for the evening!)
 
I have also enjoyed the Mongol costume I made for entertaining one of our past
Queens. It makes a wonderful item to throw over my jean&T-shirt when setting up
camp. The jacket which goes over it makes a cozy bathrobe to wear around our
camp until I have a chance to dress for the day.
 
As I learned at TYC during a nice touches class: the average European knew so
little of geography and had traveled so little that for the most part he would
not realize that someone from the New World or Africa or the Far East was that
much stranger than the odd garb brought home from the Crusades or those odd
outfits that the odd neighbor who used to be ambassador in Spain wears when he
is lounging at home.
 
Just some thoughts.

I was originally planning to post this directly to her, but some of my SCA
friends suggested that others might also be interested so here goes...
Several years ago I found several books on Indian dress in the Univ. of Wash.
library which I think you might find interesting:
1)The Indian Sari by Kamala S. Dongerkery. Publ. by All India Handicrafts Board
  in New Dehli.
2)Indian Costume by G.S. Ghurye. Publ. by Popular Prakashan in Bombay (1951)
and
3) Costumes of India and Pakistan by S.N.Dar. Publ. by D.B. Taraporevala
  and Sons Ltd. in Bombay 1969. (If not in yours, try interlibrary loan.)
These three books cover the SCA period in some detail. Pictures, however, are
not of the best quality and somewhat sparse. They discuss the Sari (also
spelled Saree by some) which is the six-plus yard long piece of fabric which is
pleated (at each wearing) into a waistband or the top of a tubular skirt, with
one end left free to drape over the shoulder. There are many ways of pleating
and draping the Sari, depending on the region (as well as the time period).
The textile patterning is dependent on the same factors.
Notice that I have not mentioned a bodice covering. During most of the time
period the short sleeved blouse (called the Choli) was not worn at all. When it
was introduced, it seems to have begun as a way for the courtesans to
accentuate the attractions of their bosoms. (I was rather distress to find this
since I am very bodyshy but was hoping to use the Sari as hot weather dress.)
Folkwear also had a pattern which included the Sari with Choli, and discussed
several ways of pleating/draping. Like many of the ethnic wear put out by this
company, it is quite modern (or at least post period), but is a nice place to
start if you can't find the more historically oriented texts. (However, since
this company has regrettably stopped publishing their patterns, you'll have to
find someone from whom you can borrow.)
The Arts of India edited by Basil Gray and publ. by Cornell University Press
(in Ithaca NY, 1981) is an art book which has BEAUTIFUL illustrations, but no
discussion of costume nor enough information to know who (lady or courtesan) is
being illustrated. (This does not matter to some, I'm told.)
I hope this is helpful.

Subject: Tartans (long)

Greetings,
	My wife read a posting to soc.culture.celtic and wanted to reply.
	I thought it would be of interest to SCA people. At the very least
	it will start people talking about tartans....:-)
 
There is a lot of debate about this subject whenever I get together with my
Scottish and Scots recreationist friends.
 
According to my Grandmother Russell (who was our family archivist), the sett
sticks for warping the looms for the tartans were broken during the Great
Prohibition. (The persecution during the prohibition of the clans caused a
goodly number of the Russell family to flee. That's howcum my paternal family
now lives in America.) However, she also said that the tartan was not the
major identifying feature of the clans. Rather, it was the badge (which was
also considered more subversive because it could be so easily hidden).
 
There is also evidence that several tartans could be worn together: one as a
kilt, another as the trews, still another in the jacjet, etc. An example of
this is the portrait of the Mac Donald children (artist unknown) which shows
two pre-1746 boys wearing 4 different tartans, only the colors (red, green and
black) being similar.
 
This dovetails well with what I have found in my books on dyeing. The colors of
the wool used in the tartans was dependent on the availability of indigo (which
had to be imported) and the local vegetable dyestuffs. The weaver (Grandma
Russell said we had several in our family) would warp the loom with whatever
wool was already dyed and therefore available at the time. Since frequently only
small amounts of any one color were available at any one time, plaids were a
very good idea. For dress wear, the brighter colors were worn. For everyday
wear, the bright colors were interspersed with undyed wool (white or brownish
black). (Grandma always said we were a frugal lot.) It has been said that
women generally did not wear the bright tartans; they evidently wore the white
and colored ones for dress wear. The vegetable dyes were limited to what grew
in the surrounding neighborhood and this would change depending on what hill
or valley you lived near. It was consistent to that area so a weaver/dyer from
one district would have a different set of colors at his disposal than the
weaver/dyer from the next district. In time a set of colors would be identified
with the clan who lived in that district. However, the arrangement of those
colors may not be consistent.
 
The truth of the matter is that the Prohibition disrupted Highland life to the
point that any set identification of a pattern of a tartan could very well have
been lost. Yes, those Highlanders were a stubborn lot, but they were not always
a match for the informants and government agents. It is interesting to note that
very few of the extant pre-1747 tartan textiles are like any of the modern clan
tartans. (No where near the number of clans that existed at that time.) Where
they are the same, it is because they were copied directly from pieces found
after the Prohibition or from some of the rare remaining sett sticks. One of
the most consistent complaints I have seen and heard is that the sett sticks
were gone, the dye recipes lost, and the old weavers and dyers who knew the
"secrets" were dead. While it is easy for us to say that all they had to do is
look at the old textiles, they did not necessarily think it worth their while.
(It really is a time consuming process which is why they had sett sticks in
the first place.)
 
After the Prohibition was repealed, tartans became more important to some of the
Highlanders.  There was a kind of "back to the roots" movement which resulted
in a particular weave of tartan becoming the sole "property" of a clan. (Others
showed no inclination whatsoever to go back to wearing tartans, even if they
could afford it.)
 
King George IV, preparing for a visit to Edinburgh in 1822, suggested that the
Scots should wear their clan's tartans for dress wear at the functions for him.
This resulted in a large number of newly developed tartans to meet the demand.
The so-called Sobieski Stuart brothers edited a manuscript called the
Vestiarium Scoticum in 1829 which falsely was supposed to have been based on a
sixteenth century work. This added more "original" tartans. Still more were
developed to accomodate the geneology hungry Americans of the past few decades.
 
An easy to find source is Robert Bain's The Clans and Tartans of Scotland. A
more scholarly approach can be had from the works by J. Telfer Dunbar and
H.F. McClintock (writing together or separately). An interesting Victorian
work which is frequently in print as a coffee table book is R.R. McIan's
The Clans of the Scottish Highlands. There are also several modern coffee table
books available (such as by one R.W. Munro and another by Lorna Blackie.)
There are also several good books on the dyes and dyestuffs of Scotland. (I own
at least two.)
 
My husband says that I have written too much, but I've done a LOT of condensing.
Please forgive any lack of brevity.

Subject:  Re various postings

Greetings to the folk of the Rialto!  Since I am not yet on
the net, I have asked Baron Henry to reply for me.

Guillaume-a lot of us have done Italian dance.  Nearest to you would
be TSvetan, and I know he can give you copies of instructions for
Verceppe, and probably Gelosia as well.  Phone Sheldon Lofthouse in
Guelph (on Silverwood, probably a "new" listing).  If no luck, let
me know, and I'll dig them up.

Pearls--they used them as necklaces, strands on turbans, and
sewn on costumes in Byzantium (your library should have some art
books on Byzantine mosaics or paintings).  Lady Myfanwy de Levere,
our local lapidary person assures me the Romans wore fresh-water
pearls.  I have not myself checked out the classical references.
Pearls turn up again in the Italian Renaissance (stranded in hair,
on chains, etc.).  Like so many
things, there is a corridor from Near East, to Greece, to Italy
(particularly Venice), because of the trade routes, and the
migrations of the Jews (who brought things like indigo) and
Arabs.  Let me know if it is important to get an earlier
"Western" date for pearls and I'll hit the history/archaeology
collection at home.

Cheers and Accolades- It isn't ALWAYS Christmas in Ealdormere.
Wass hael is the Anglo-Saxon expression for "Be healthy".
(Wass is the singular imperative of the verb "to be".)
Its exact equivalent in Latin is "Vale".  ("Vivat" is "May he/she/it
live" and has many equivalent in many languages, including Hebrew
"Lakaiim" (sp?) and Greek "Na Zeis".)

Wasshael, like so many other wishes for long life and prosperity,
tends to come up in the context of drinking.  A punch bowl made up
to drink people's health is a "Wassail bowl".  Winter solstice
was an especially good time to do this.

Think of us Ealdormerans as having de-corrupted Wassail/Wasshael.

The Baroness Septentria, Mistress Kaffa, is credited with starting
Wasshael at War, after the creation of Ealdormere.

Subject: Event BB

An event newsgroup?  There are some inherant problems with this.  At
least 50% of our readers receive SCAnet information via SCA-Digest.  This
is a digestified version of ALT.SCA mailed from MC.LCS.MIT.EDU and gatewayed
at Ohio-State.

Local redistribution is not possible to the digest side of SCAnet. You would 
have to arbitrarily set up distribution lists by kingdom.  Our digest database
is not that complex, yet.  (Moreover I do not have time to create a neat 
little DB application for SCAnet in the foreseeable future) You cannot
set a "distribution" field for "mail-based" system.  Most of the digest sites 
are non-UN*X sites.  Further, not all UN*X sites that do receive ALT.SCA 
support net-news distribution fields.

Then there is the problem of "getting" a newsgroup.  Alt groups are generally 
not moderated, mod.xxx.xxx groups are not that easy to set up, and **WHO** has 
the time?

There is a question of traffic on such a group.  Will there be much, any?  The 
readers of SCAnet are many, the posters are realitively few.  (Look over your 
past digests/archives -- you will see that the posters are a small set.  Since 
I see how many people actually *READ* SCAnet, I can say with authority that 
there is a large silent majority out there!)  Then, there is the audience --
do you want to recreate the list I already have?  Or do you want to use my 
list?  

Already, I am overloaded by the work needed for SCAnet maintenance (and 
autocrating and teaching and working and...). Recently, Eowyn volunteered to 
help; she has already gained "saint" status with the work she is doing! 
(Thanx Eowyn) Does somebody want to **DUPLICATE** this effort?

Then there are net rules: are events "commercial"?  I think not, since we are 
a non-profit organization.  But listing "things to do that cost money" are on 
the fringe of accepted behaviour.   (LISTING SF/FANTASY CON INFORMATION IS 
RIGHT OUT AND HIGHLY DISCOURAGED IF NOT CENSORED)

SUGGESTION: There is an "in-box" of DATE, EVENT_NAME, EVENT_LOCATION, 
CONTACT_PERSON (net address, USnail address, and phone number), 
80 character description, cost.  At the begining of the month this in-box is 
compiled into ONE-MESSAGE that is sent to SCAnet.  All other information about
this event can then be requested from the autocrat.

Running any Digest/BB/newsgroup takes a lot of work. It should not duplicate 
already existing communication channels.  While SCAnet is not meant for event 
announcements, it is a good communication channel.  

I, as an autocrat for an upcoming event (ask me about it directly), sympathize 
with other autocrats who wish to tell the net population about their wonderful 
ideas/activities/and encourage other NETfolk to attend their events.

As moderator/coordinator of the net, I cannot allow SCA-net to be over-run with
local announcements. Already the digest grows to a size that many cannot 
afford to read.  (Not to mention the disk space it eats!)  Extraneous local 
announcements would detract from the digest as a whole.  I think once-a-month, 
a message itemizing events submitted by NETfolk might be acceptable (its only
once a month -- many could skip it).  This message *IS* moderated.  It is 
submitted to the unmoderated SCAnet.

Thoughts and responses on SCAnet MANAGEMENT, especially digest verses news, 
need for back-issues, this event announcment topic, et cetera and so forth, 
should be addressed to:

not sent into the SCAnet.  Please respond to this message by sending me mail

(most important) a "necklace" of brightly colored bits of thread with many and
varied tacky, tawdry objects hanging pendant therefrom.

Traditionally (the Order has been closed-- several times...), the Mystery
Burgundian (_don't_ ask; you'll only regret it...) would magically appear in
the Meridien Royal Court and announce that some lucky (some used other words)
gentle would receive the OOO.  The Populace would then start to chant, "Who'll
get the OOO?  Who'll get the OOO?"  The proper response to this was, "Who
cares?"  The Burgundian would then prance about the hall as the people
chanted, until finally his hand came to rest on the recipient's (spelled,
"victim's") shoulder.

Finally, many of those upon whom the OOO was bestowed indicate their
companionate in the Order (if and when they acknowledge it at all...) by
writing the initials "OOO" as 3 concentric circles.

                             For the amusement of one and all,

Subject:  "Fair witness:"  an explanation

Greetings!

In the midst of a response to some of my comments, Arval pointed out to me
that the term "fair witness", which I recently used, seems to be indigenous
only to Meridies and Trimaris, and requested an explanation.  Since I didn't
realize this (I haven't traveled to other Kingdoms much), I wish to apologize
to anyone I confused.  The explanation appears below.

First, however, I would like to pass along Arval's suggestion of "indigenous
terms and customs" as a topic (he mentioned wondering if cloven fruit are
universal).  I like the idea!  Any takers out there?

As to "fair witness:"  the term is from Robert Heinlein's novel,
_Stranger_in_a_Strange_Land_.  In the novel, a fair witness is a professional
witness whose absolute impartiality and objectivity are guaranteed.  There is
an oft-quoted scene in the book which illustrates the situation perfectly,
Someone points out a house on a hillside to a fair witness and asks what color
the house is.  The fair witness replies, "It's white on this side."  Since
that was the only side of the house she could directly observe, it was the
only side of the house she would comment on.  Other sides of the house might
have been other colors, and the training of a fair witness prevents
assumptions regarding, or comment or attestation regarding, that which the
fair witness does not directly observe.  Also to be noted:  the mark of a fair
witness at work is a white cloak.

The parallels to various historical functions of heralds are fairly obvious.
Since the Heinlein novel is so widely known, the term came to be commonly used
down here to indicate the use of a herald as an impartial observer, arbiter,
go-between, or notary public.  So pervasive is the association, now, that I
personally know of several instances when, not having a tabard handy, a herald
grabbed a white cloak which was to hand instead.  Everyone recognized what was
transpiring.

Another common term down here is "under tabard," used to indicate something
(impending awards, for example) imparted to a herald within the confies of the
office and in confidentiality.

Thanks for reading this!

                             In Service,

First of all to Lord Taran Brav ( is it 'o' or 'a'?) for your posting about
the duty of a herald. Most of the times I have gone to herald when trying
to find out about creating an acceptable name, device, etc. they have been
wont to throw a huge book on heraldry at you and say its in there.

Secondly are there any suggestions on how to prepare and present a Brew
for entry into A&S competitions? Do the people who judge them (I refer not
to the competitions specifically for Brewing and vinting but "open"
competitions)  know what they are doing.

Lastly, I am curious as to how you gentles got involved in the Society,
Were you walking past a park and see some people dressed up in armour commiting
mahem upon one annother, see a presentation at a school, or what.

Greetings!

My thanks, Mistress Cher, for posting your explanation.  

I find this kind of discussion most fascinating.  It is what makes
the Rialto so much fun: learning how things differ in other parts of
the Laurel Kingdoms.  For example, several months ago, someone posted
a discussion of an event in An Tir, and mentioned "the eric," a term
which utterly mystified me.  It was explained to me as follows: The
"eric" is the central area of an outdoor event, or the lists at any
event.  It is the area where everyone is supposed to be on best
behavior, in garb, and around which the nicest period pavillions are
set up.  The list is often (traditionally?) marked off with red ropes,
and so came to be referred to as "Eric the Red" (Can anyone exlpain
how?) and eventually "the eric".  This term is not used in the East,
and is unknown, as far as I know, in all the Pennsic Kingdoms.  Can
people tell me just where it is in vogue?

	I think 'or what' is the answer here.  My roommate in Dallas had
a degree in History, specializing in Medieval History.  He hadn't had the
time to check out SCA while he was in college, but now that he was working
he was interested in it.  I had been into fencing in college, as well as 
SF and FRPing, so it sounded interesting to me too, so I tagged along.
After several phone calls, we finally contacted someone, who told us that  
there was a small tourney that very weekend just outside Dallas, and gave
us directions.  We wandered out, talked to various people, basically played
the part of interested people wandering in off of the street.  We started 
going to the local fighter practice, attended a few Baronial meetings,
got suited up in loaner armor and got bashed, all the normal stuff... :-)
Eventually my friend got disgusted at the politics of the group and quit
going, while I started working on my armor.  I entered my first tourney
(Steppes Warlord, A.S. 17) and managed to win one fight (by virtue of
killing my opponent as he took my last arm.  That's a strange feeling,
standing there knowing there's nothing you can do while the other guy
trys to decide if that was a killing head shot!) and have been more or
less active ever since.
	My friend now attends events on occation, has a couple of sets 
of garb and a helm, and may even get active again one of these days.  
(and when he does, don't loan him your weapon, it seems that if there is
a problem with it, it will fail while he's using it.  Saw him break three
swords in one day once at fighter practice.  And this was in Ansteorra!)
That I remained active was mostly due to the welcome I recieved from the
people of the Steppes when I started getting interested, Duke Jonathon,
Duchess Willow, (then) Earl Master Lloyd, Inman, Harald and especially
Thorkel (Now Sir Thorkel, as are Duke Sir Inman and Sir Harald) for the
gift of the helm I'm still wearing (and which has yet to be dented, though
it is still rusty :-)  and others whose names I can't spell.  :-)

Greetings assembled genetles, I have come once again seeking advice.
Some of you may recall that, about two months ago, I announced
the formation of a new group in Princeton.  Well, we have about 5
students and a random assortment of Barony folks who are close-by.
My question is, what structure do we adopt?
Some people have recomended organizing as a college.  Others say
we should form a canton.  This does not bother me nearly as much
as the next question, what is a regular schedule of events?
How often do other college groups meet? Have events?

BTW, Princeton group has its own acct: Anachron@PUCC.  East Kingdom
people, especially those around the area, should feel free to email
us info on upcomming events.

Subject: Anybody know "The Rolling Steins"?
Message-Id: <600658163/kee@A.NL.CS.CMU.EDU>

This morning I was awakened by a phone call from Lochac (Australia).
A woman named Carol seeks my assistance in locating a cooks' guild
known as the "Rolling Steins".  She has a pen-pal in that group whose
address she has lost, and would like that person to contact her.  We
had a bad phone connection, but I think the name of the lost pen-friend
is something like "Annairall".  Carol thought the group was in the East
Kingdom someplace, which is why she called me.

I don't know the Rolling Steins, and I advised Carol to call the East
Kingdom Chroniclers and place a notice in the next "Pikestaff".  It was
only after we had said goodbye that I realized I could use the net.
Thus, I don't have the information necessary to contact Carol.  But the
lost pen-pal, wherever she is, probably does.  So if anyone knows of
this group or this person, could they please contact them and tell them
that Carol in Australia wants to hear from Annairall?

(If you think this is an odd story, you can ask your friendly
Kingdom Seneschal(e) for stranger ones still. ;-)

I must ask, in what sense inappropriate?  I am an arab in the service of my
Caliph, Salah-al-Din (may Allah bless his name) and my "court garb" is extremly
"flashy", as it is covered with silver thread, silver trim, pearls and other
precious and semi-precious gems and jewels.  There are also several layers
of it, each "flashier" than the last.  The garb is entirely period and proper
for one of my status and occupation. (I am the Captain of the privateer Ghanima,
[read that: pirate])

I am indeed "playing the game by the rules".  I originally chose an arabic
persona because I looked good in the garb, however in the 10 years since then
I have done exhaustive research into not only what my persona would do
(or not do) but6 also the political climate, and the european activites that
had an impact on my persona.  Also it is generally more difficult to do
accurate research for a non-european persona, as most of the good sources
are written in a language that does not translate easily or well [like arabic].
As a non-european persona I have been looked down upon at events [fortunatly
that is an extremely rare occurance] with an expression that seems to say
"What are you doing here?  How dare you wear such outlandish costuming?"

>The SCA's stated "area of study" (of pre-seventeenth century Europe and the

I (and most other middle eastern personas) are quite within the "area of study"

    I can speak for myself, thank you.  If I wanted to apologize I would have.
  Give me credit for a brain Kwelland Njal and for the rest of you that wrote

  there have been too many times when ideas like this were started with humor

 that is it.  If I care to make such statements - I can make them myself but 
 then I think most of the sca.readers KNOW that.

What happens, good my lord, is that most people have a lot of fun for
one reign, and a few people get offended for a reign.  For example, in
Atlantia, Duke Baudouin's first rule was under the Japanese name
Tsuneo.  His lady was in Chinese persona, as his first concubine Nyan
Nyan.  Everyone had a great time, as far as I know.  Personally, I
would LOVE to see someone Japanese win the Crown of the East (Go

I disagree. According to 'The History of the English Longbow', the
majority of the bodies in the army at that time were archers. I became
curious about the mechanics of production and supply of bows and arrows
and I have yet to find the data I was looking for, but effort and budget
were noted and significant.

I have a wonderful book with lovely recipes for everything from
strawberry wine to onion wine to scottish milk cordial, and am
perfectly willing to xerox pages and send them to people.
The book is "folk wines and cordials" by M. A. Jagendorf (or similar
spelling) and is published by Vanguard press. It is available
from the publisher (Manhattan, NY based) and quotes Digby, so 
you can get period-ish and period recipes from it.

hope this helps people, keep on brewing!

Speaking of odd orders, would there happen to be any Crimson Brothers out
there on the net?  According to my brother on the east coast, they have 
several good stories.  They were involved in The Shrine at Pensic, and
make special awards when people do exceptionally amazing and/or stupid
things.  One such award I heard a little about was a "thumbs up" gauntlet.
I don't recall who it was awarded to, or the reason behind it, but the
award itself was a chain gauntlet over a glove filled with epoxy resin,
with the fingers forming a fist with the thumb pointing up.  If anyone 
out there has first hand versions of such Crimson Brotherhood stories, 
I'm sure they would be much better than I could manage, not being bardic.

Subject: references for 1100 AD requested

I need some assistance in locating reference materials for women's
clothing in Western Europe in 1100 AD.  I am specifically interested 
in the styles of England, Germany, France and Scotland.

Along those same lines, I need references to lifestyle in or immediately 
before the year 1100 - music, art, dance, daily activities, etc.  History
and church politics are not required - unless you know of an incredibly
detailed and complete work on the period.

In other research, I am interested in a history of sleeves and sleeve
styles.  When did sleeves first begin to be set in bodices, and how
was the setting done?  What about other sewing techniques - what is the 
history of stitches and seaming?

I have been referred to one costume book that is a forensic analysis
of costuming.  Does anyone know the correct reference information for
this work?  I would like to order it.  Reviews would also be appreciated.

I have some basic texts and information - I need the detailed scoop.
Any responses will be gratefully received.  I will summarize and post
if requested.

Thanks for any assistance you may render in this task,

P.S.  I am serious about this.  Please post full information, not just
      'ticklers'.  Many folks will not take to the time to get up and write
      when given so little information.  Where is this event?  Who of note

Subject: Names, badges, etc.

Come on, folks, get real. I don't really care what we call this thing,
as long as I can get to it. A rose by any other name? Most anyone who
is on the net won't generally be asking "what news of the Rialto," but
more likely will be commenting on an issue. If so, does it matter where
the topic originated? I'd think it is more relevant to name the person
who originated the topic.

But, if we must have a name...
Although I still vote for "George," we could avoid the implied sexism
in the word "fisherman" by the wordd "Trawler." Normally, when I think
if a fisherman I think of rod and reel, but the net is the trawler's main
'weapon.' Any thoughts on this almost dead and certainly wimpering subject?

As to a badge (again, as if it matters), if we are a net, then we use net.
If we are a Bulletin Board, then we should use a cork. For those who get\
this in digest form (like myself), we should perhaps use some [never mind].


Is this whole discussion really as important as the fact that the East 
Kgdom is refusing to use mundanely standard tests for armour and
equipment (are our lives being endengered by a bunch of egos?), or
the direction the SCA should be taking in these next years?

Subject: Apology, Explanation, & Some Comment

I'd like to apologize to anyone who was upset by the volume of my recent
comments. I get "digests of digests" via a local BBS; at my last session,
there were 19 digests waiting to be read. Not messages -- *digests* of
messages. So there was a lot to ponder & comment on.
  And then the system took almost everything I'd typed in the month
and scrunched 'em into one digest. Twice. I was *NOT* trying to dominate the
net.
A few comments:
AMY WINOGRAD FRIEDMAN, the "Jeopardy" winner, is Lady Gwyneth of Ownsrealm,
formerly of Gara Yedinaroga/Towers/Carolingia, now of Stonemarche (NH).
FAYE RINGEL, a previous winner (Mistress Morgiane de Provence, 1st Bns.
Bridge) was last known to be living in Beyondd-the-Mountain (CT) and teaching
at the US Coast Guard Academy.
HEBREW CALENDARS: The "Jewish year" is designated "A.M." for "Anno Mundi",
i.e. "Year of the World" [cf: "mundane"].
ACCOLADES: There's always some bozo who shouts "Yippee" at the end of the
Vivats, and I wish they would stop. It was funny once. Maybe.
"OOH AAH OH": This is also a funny-once, and is an insult to the calligraphers
and illuminators. If it's a magnificent scroll -- as is the norm in the East
-- then give it the *sincere* appreciation it deserves. This cutesy-poo ritual
is not funny to the artists.
TO HENRY OF MALDON: You include non-SCA groups in "the Known World" but that
doesn't work because the KW is a synonym for the SCA. There are other "places"
outside of the SCA that have "existence" in the SCA's world.
TO WILLIAM DE CORBIE: Thanks for stating my points, so much better than I
could. Vivat.
CHEQUY VOIDED: Is probably impossible, and if it isn't, 'twould be ugly as
sin.
--- That's all. Really. For now....

Subject: Re: Heralds

First let me introduce myself.  I am Lord Taran of Windy Hill, formerly Golden
Gryphon Pursuivant to Carolingia and Diadem Pursuivant - Regional Deputy in
the Northern region of the East.  I have always been more oriented to the
performance of heraldry than to the study of armory.

The mission of the *College of Arms* is single-fold.  It is responsible for
the registering of historically authentic names and armorial insignia for
*anyone* who chooses to avail themselves of its services.  No one has to
register their name or device, and as far as I have been able to ascertain,
the only method for ensuring persona that fit the SCA's idea of good is peer
pressure.  The College of Arms also tries, generally, to help in other aspects
of Heraldry in the S.C.A., sometimes failing miserably.

It is the mission of the local pursuivant to perform the other duties of the
practicing herald, these being, very generally, heraldry on the field of
combat, heraldry in the court, and general announcement heraldry.  This is in
addition to the duties of being the first line in the armorial chain, and the
all-too-often neglected duty of educating those he serves in the *proper* way
of doing what they want to do heraldically.  Unfortunately, those who frequent
the armorials and ordinaries are often overspecialized and can be woefully
inadequate in performance heraldry, and are very prone to look down upon those
who perform the other services.

They say that absolute power corrupts absolutely, and the College of Arms has
that problem.  It has become extremely involved in the role of arbiter of
heraldic taste and authenticity in the SCA, and has perhaps lost sight of the
fact of its service to the populace of the SCA.  There is to my mind no
greater bureaucracy than the College of Arms, and therein lies the real
problem.

There is nothing wrong with the specialization of those who deal in Armory.  I
do, however, believe that no person should be considered for Principal Herald,
King at Arms, or perhaps even a regional Herald until and unless he or she has
proved themselves knowledgeable in and committed to those forms of heraldry
which the populace is most likely to come in contact with.  I have seen too
many high-ranking heralds who do not know the first thing about protocal, who
treat a Twelfth Night Court, a War Court, a Royal Progress in a small shire,
and multiple Reigns as the same thing and *ho-hum, another court*, and who
sincerely believe, when called on to perform, that this is the garbage
collection that they are forced to do before getting on to the *real* business
of ruling on names and devices.

When I became Pursuivant of Carolingia (before titled Pursuivants), the Barony
felt that the herald was an only just necessary evil whom you put up with
because he was part of the tradition or if you really wanted to register your
arms.  I believe that through the efforts of myself, my successors, and other
heralds in this Barony who were anxious to serve not just the College, not
just their employer, but the populace at large, that this situation has
changed.  We practice courtesy as heralds in our performances, do our best to
assist new submitters *before* they get rejected, and try in a number of ways
to raise the standards of all variants of heraldry.

Please excuse this long lecture, but it is a subject dear to my heart.  I also
will tend to flame, and have ever since a high-ranking heraldic friend of mine
suggested that the SCA wanted something a certain way heraldically because 80%
of the College of Arms wanted it that way. (only 80%?). I am,

                                  In service,

Subject:  The Tale of BBMM Atalaya's Cherry

Greetings!

Since my reference a while back to a story about Her Redundancy Baroness
Baroness Mistress Mistress Atalaya's cherry, I've received requests to lighten
up life on the Rialto by posting it. Since I now have Her Adequacy's
begrudging permission to do so, I offer it for your (hopeful) amusement.
Also, thanks to those who requested this tale for their patience in awaiting
its appearance.

First, it must be told that Her Redundancy is squired unto Sir Bronislaus of
Vilnius.

At the Trimaris Spring Coronation, Lord Treve Morningstar found a most unusual
item about the "Wishing Well" (as the well at this site is known), to wit:  a
squire's belt.  It was simply left there.  Both appalled and surprised at such
carelessness, Lord Treve picked up the belt and examined it.  Noting the bunny
rabbit upon it, he realized that the belt must belong to one of Sir
Bronislaus' squires.

Being a dutiful squire himself, Lord Treve sought out Sir Bron and turned the
belt over to him.  Sir Bron examined the belt and said, "Why, this is
Atalaya's belt!"  To which Lord Treve replied (approximately), "GAK!", as Lord
Treve is also BBMM Atalaya's apprentice and he immediately realized that he
now was probably in _extremely_ deep kim-chee.

(AUTHOR'S NOTE:  Herself claims that she was *NOT* careless; Lord Jhanos
seduced her away with his music, totally entranced.  She also wishes it to be
known by all and sundry that it is not *she* who abuses Lord Jhanos!!
Nononono!  'Tis _quite_ the other way 'round!  Lastly, I am informed that Lord
Treve is _still_ apologizing for precipitating this entire incident, in hopes
of avoiding "re-education.")

Sir Bron, meanwhile, decided that Her Adequacy was in some need of a lesson
with regard to her carelessness.  To this end, Sir Bron appeared in Their
Majesties' Court at Martinmas Moot (Crown Tourney) some 3 months later.  With
TRM's permission, BBMM Atalaya was called before the Court as well.

The Court and the Populace were then addressed by Sir Bron, who spoke at
length upon the subject of loss.  More precisely, the subject of the loss of
things most precious, and which can never be recovered.  Whilst he spoke, Sir
Bron dangled Mistress Atalaya's red belt from his hand.

Herself listened quietly and attentively, sweating blood all the while.

Finally, Sir Bron not only relented, but being a most exceedingly gracious and
generous knight, announced that he would also return unto BBMM Atalaya another
item Her Redundancy was reputed to have lost.  Whereupon he presented Her
Adequacy with a necklace from which hung pendant...a cherry.

Now, of course, a new matter for debate arose:  who would be the one bold
enough to _take_ Atalaya's cherry?

Someone (BBMM Atalaya, for some unfathomable reason, suspects Sir Bronislaus)
undertook to resolve this matter by issuing unto Her Redundancy's squire
brothers the challenge take her cherry.

Of course, all the other squires resented their inablility to take part in the
chase.  Indeed, one of Sir Brendan mac Angus' squires presented himself at Her
Adequacy's tent, known as the Veranda (as in, "sittin' on the Veranda an'
sippin' on a mint julep..." <---heavy Southern accent required) to formally
register his complaint.

As a result, in 2 weeks, at the Kingdom Winter Arts and Sciences Faire, the
quest is open to all Trimarian squires.

For her part, BBMM Atalaya neither confirms nor denies ever having lost her
cherry.  And as far as tricking her out of her cherry goes, Herself says, "If
I got tricked out of it once, I **certainly** wouldn't let it happen again!!"

And so, the question yet burns throughout Trimaris:  who indeed will take
Atalaya's cherry!

                        Respectfully (well, sort of...) submitted,

                              Cher de Bellevue

Greetings!

Our system was down for maintenence for a few days, so once again my comments
will be upon a variety of topics.

DIVERSITY:  Regardless of any of our opinions, I think it's safe to say that
whether we like it or not, the diversity of personae in the SCA is here to
stay.  It's certainly to ingrained a situation to be rid of now.  So, let's
all agree to disagree, and go party! :-):-):-)

EVENT ANNOUNCEMENT SERVICE:  Sounds good to me, but then I don't fully
understand all the processes and ramifications involved.  This also goes for
changing the "classification" of this net.  Perhaps our esteemed moderator
could comment and/or explain (to me, at least...).

HERALDS:  Firstly, no one has yet answered my request to tell me what the
alleged problems in the Trimarian Heralds' Office are.  So, I would like to
offer kudos at this time to Sycamore Herald for his apt comments.  And to them
I would add that unlike any other office in the SCA, the Herald has a two-fold
role to fill.  The bureaucratic, and the ceremonial.  This is without
mentioning other functions which have accrued over time, such as that of "fair
witness".  The heralds touch on many "gray areas" in trying to function, and
*no one* can keep all of the people happy all of the time.  And as Sycamore
Herald said:  we serve the _Society_, first and foremost.

SAKE:  Many thanks! to David Herron for his obliging response (which has also
been forwarded to people on the Homebrewers' Net requesting same-- hope
that's OK).  And thanks as well to Todd Ellner for his suggestions (and
humor).

                              In Service,

Subject: wooden beads in costuming

Most of my experience of this is actually middle eastern & central asian--but 
in those cases, the use of wooden, bone, and painted clay beads (among other
materials) as buttons/closures or just as ornamentation, goes well into 
mesolithic times.  I seem to remember wooden beads used as buttons in a 
scandanavian site dated to about 600.  The laps still use traditional wooden
oblong buttons and oblong loops on their clothing in this sort of style (alos
**oops*** also used today on some modern parkas).  

My impression, however, is that beading was a middle eastern/middle asian
influence on european costuming, and was only popular as an ornamentation 
motif in eastern europe and in spain (moorish).  I don't have any immediate
documentation on this, however.  Gems were certainly worked into a lot of 
rennaisance foppishness and jacobean frippery (stomachers and so on) both as
jewelry and sewn into the fabric.

There is documentation of pearl broaches that go into the early rennaisance,
which I specifically remember--and these were copies of a middle eastern 
style of jewelry.  In the early rennaisance, there seems to have been an
Italian vogue of large irregularly shaped pearls worked into broaches of 
fantastic creatures--a specimen of which is the {something-or-other} Jewel,
one of the most famous of the large pearls, worked into a broach representing
a merman, at the Victoria & Albert Museum.

I have a vague recollection of pearls being used on headresses in europe at
earlier dates. I think if you do a little research, you will find that *pearls*
are period for medieval cultures, but that *strings* of pearls are not--but
that's just a hunch...

According to Winston Churchill's *History of the English-Speaking

War was its *archers*.  Do you have information to the contrary?

Subject:      Webster's Anyone?

According to Webster's Collegiate:

Medieval:  Of, relating to, or characteristic of the Middle Ages

Middle Ages:  the period of European history from about AD 500 to about 1500

I could also tackle a nearby group of history professors for their academic
definition, but is that really the point of this argument?  It's not the
world's definition of Medieval and the Middle Ages, but what we want the SCA
to be.  As the group grows, so grow the number of things people want it to be.
Organizations change, yes.  However, it has to cling to certain basic tenets or
else it might as well shut down the old structure and purpose and build a new
one.(Want a mundane example?  The Girl Scouts don't just do home and camping
anymore.  They also do career options, drug abuse, non-camping survival skills.
They have grown to fill certain needs, but their basic tenet--to educate and
help girls is the same.)

The SCA has and will continue to change.  However, might I suggest a trip to
the nearest copy of the Knowne World Handbook for a look at the entries
pertinent to the founding and basic principles of the SCA?  Perhaps everyone
doesn't love the BOD or the central organization, but there is a common idea or
ideal which should be at the heart of this organization.

In response to the comments on the College of Arms made by Master Korwyn
Ariannaid on or about 2 January 1989.

Good my Lord,

I do not claim any knowledge of the exact problems occurring in Atenveldt,
An Tir, or Trimaris.  But your remarks cannot go unanswered.

As a long-standing member of the both the Society and the College of Arms
(app. 12 years), I have to disagree with your opinions concerning the
heralds' responsibilities.  I am no more "responsible"  to the College of
Arms than you are to the Marshallate, be it Kingdom or Corporate.  I serve
the Society and its people, first and foremost.  The difficulty arises when
the desires of a kingdom (or a KIng) run contrary to the rules long since
established by the College, in accordance with its assigned mission.

Read the Corpora, see what it says the College of Arms is to do.  The
duties of the College go beyond what you say they should be (or are, in
your opinion).  At times, the will of the Crown has to bow to the good of
all.  Whether that is fortunate or not depends on your opinion regarding
monarchy and its "divine right"; however, if the Crown asked that a
patently dangerous or non-period weapon be allowed in the lists, the
marshallate would, properly, object.  The same analogy applies to the
College of Arms.  Therefore as a member of the College and a Kingdom Senior
Herald (deputy to Brigantia Principal Herald of the East Kingdom), where
does my duty lie?  If the situation is analagous to the one I described
above (i.e., the Crown granting a title it had no right to grant or telling
a subject he could use a charge on his device when that charge is
restricted and he had no rights to it), I'd politely tell the King he is
wrong.  Then I'd duck!  Then I'd crawl away, lick my wounds, and still feel
I was right.

The College of Arms is certainly not separate from the various realms;
indeed, we all exist together.  If the antagonism you describe is as deeply
felt as you imply, it is a great misfortune probably born of
misunderstanding and lack of communication.  It can be solved, but
certainly not by relegating the serious efforts of the members of the
College of Arms to clerks and "p-a systems".

That was hyperbole.  The archers gave the English a special, often telling,
*edge*, but that is not the same as being a mainstay.  A modern analogy might be
a country with a superior air force:  The jets may make all the difference in
the world, but the 'mainstays' of that force will still probably be the forces
which have to take and hold the ground.

Subject: Visitor Persona


I am Mustapha al-Muhaddith, a man of mixed Persian and Arab ancestry who has
travelled through North Africa, Egypt, Perisa, and Italy.  I currently
live in the Barony of Carolingia.  That is to say, even though I may
have Persian citizenry, I am a subject of Baron Patri and the Crown of
the East.  I must obey the laws and customs of the land in which I now
live, while at the same time, I maintain the Islamic customs and
notions of Chivalry of my homeland.  

At the risk of beating an already dead horse into the ground, allow me
to put my perspective on the matter of mixing persona.  All of us in
the Knowne World are visitors.  We have moved to our current homes
within the SCA from some medival time and place.  As far as Mustapha
is concerned, things from different times come from far away places.
That is to say fencing would be unknown to Mustapha who lived in the
7th Century (13th C.E.), but it is something he does because he
learned it from his friend Danulf who comes from somewhere else
(Elizabethian England) where they do fencing.  Carolingia is
someplace north of Italy, as far as Mustapha is concerned.  This
turning of time into geography is a nice way of creatively smoothing
out anachronism that inevitably arise.

We are all visitors, in the sense that we come from someplace else
where we would have different customs and would owe loyalties to
different monarchs.  Yet our personas now live within the Knowne World
where they owe at least titular fealty to their local Lord, and must
at least apparently obey the laws and customs of the land.  Anything
else is a jarring intrusion into our world, and well it should be.

Some of my remarks here follow similar remarks that David Friedman
(Cariadoc) has made.  Intrestest readers should consult his
miscellany.

May Allah, the Creater of all People, grant you peace.

With a muted post-horn as the logo?  Or perhaps call it "Torre and
Traxis" (or was it "Thurm & Taxis" -- it's been years since I've read
it), with the arms specified for that organization.

For those who haven't read the book (Pynchon's most accessable, with a
terrific Jacobean revenge tragedy right in the middle of it) all of this
refers to a couple of rival commercial courier services that supposedly
spanned all of Europe during much of the Middle Ages and Renaissance.
For a variety of reasons, they are nicely analogous to our `Rialto'.

	I also like rec.sca, but rec.org.sca is probably how it would have

what the most popular one was David?

                Oh really?  Then why wasn't that carefully explained before
this discussion began and why are there so many people that got angry with the

   I beg to differ with you but "muddle" here seems to be ther word.  It seems
that SCA has carefully studied the middle ages of Europe and has doen rather
well and knows NEARLY NOTHING about any other cultures!  Sorry but when I 
joined the group it was because I was joining a group of people who were in-
terested in "these current middle ages" not "these current european middle ages"!  That's just the problem here.  There are some people who've decided that
the middle ages only happened "really" in Europe even though other peoples ex-
isted.  They weren't as important or as interesting.  If that's the attidude
taken by SCA then your first word will become the motto of the SCA   "muddling".

I'd rather grow in my knowledge, not muddle, thank you.

     Point taken.  But your mistification can be easily explained.  Why are
your taste preferences different than your SO's why do you like blue and not
black etc etc.....  Just because another culture is there does not mean that
you have to enjoy the study of it.

    No flames:  You have a point but I'd have to see the documentation.  The
point I had being that the Middle Ages dealt with an age, a time, not an ex-
perience of social culture, but an experience of life everywhere... Does that
make sense?

Elizabeth Braidwood of An Tir posted that the middle ages refers
to a specific element of social history that occured in Europe
during the period (aprox) of 600-1600. (I hope this paraphrases
the thopughts expressed.)
However, while it is true that not all cultures passed through a
medieval period during that time, a wide variety of cultures did.  Those
characteristics that make the middle ages a distinct period occured, as
far as I know, throughout Asia as well as in Europe (I have no idea
about Africa, Australia, or the Americas). Persia, China, Japan, etc all
passed through periods where the political structure was based on a
warrior class, ruling regions of various size in the name of some
centralizing power of varying strength.  These warriors drew their
income from the land, worked by locals.  Technology was about on par
with Europe.  What distinguishes the Ashikaga Shogunate from the
Merovingens, other that one occured in Japan and the other France?

     That's my two shkalim.

	While I agree with you and others in principal, there are a few
points I would like to raise.

	A strong force (perhaps *THE* force) in what we do is a belief in
the code of honor encompassed by chivalry.  While other cultures had a 
code of honor (sometimes even more strongly in effect), SCA is built on
chivalrous conduct, conduct that makes little sense outside of Medieval
Europe.  Most of our events are staged with the idea that people attending
are going to adhere to this code, in fact, it is actually written into the
rules of the list!  So, while I agree that other cultures *must* be included
if we are to do what we do well, I disagree with you about your status as
a visitor.  As the previous poster with the marvelous Chinese/european
persona stated so well, your persona may not even understand the code you
find yourself under, but you should try to emulate it.  That very thing 
is part of what makes it work.

	It is also what makes theme events set outside our High Medieval
melieu fun, especially when those hosting it take the time to make us aware
of the differences to be found (often with great humorous effect.)  In fact,
the actual time and place of the chivalric ideal we are personifying as a 
group was so rooted in a time and place that a very good number of *European*
personas must be viewed as visitors.  Certainly my persona, the son of a 
member of the Varangian Guard traveling to his fathers homeland of Iceland
in the early 11th C, finds some of the restrictions of chivalry strange or
downright alien; I can only imagine what it must be like for some of the 
Celts!  But I think that "when in Rome..." is probably a period saying.

	Basically, SCA was created for fun, to live, for a little while,
like a lord or lady in a medieval romance.  The spirit that created those
tales _never really existed_, but we are trying to recreate it in much the
same spirit that the writers of those stories tried to capture it.  While
the Society has certainly grown since its inception, I don't think that we
have outgrown this idea.  Oh, I know, we have moved somewhat away from that
towards respectability  (Heavy :-)  with our work on authenticity, but we
are still only trying to recreate the Middle Ages "as they should have been."
When you get down to it, all of us, even the 13th C Norman lord or lady raised
on the chansons of the glory of the Knight, are visitors here.  And as long as
we always remember that (except when we aren`t supposed to! :-) it doesn't 
matter when or where you are from.
 
Long live Chivalry!

)I made precisely that mistake when I said I had reservation information

)nothing but answering my mail.  You have been warned!

	I've seen several postings from people who *really* dislike the
idea of posting event notices.  Aside from Elke's 300 baud and trans atlantic
gripe (~shudder~ I remember 300 baud...) I think that most of them were mainly
concerned about the clutter all those event notices would generate.  But...
I feel that there are event announcements that we would profit from seeing.
An example would be an event recently hosted by my former Shire, the Dragon's
Ball (and of course the post-revel, the Dragon's other Ball... :-), a purely
Dance oriented event.  Held in Lexington Ky last Oct, it drew at least one
gentle from Ontario, who said he wouldn't have come if it was a 'silly fighting
event.'  That kind of distance from Lexington reaches well into Calontir, the 
East and Meridies, and may even hit parts of Atlantia as well.  Perhaps some
gentles from further afield would have even flown in for it, who knows?  But
as it was hosted by a relatively unknown shire, it was only advertised in the
Pale (well, there may have been an announcement in Popular Chivalry, I'm not
certain.)  

	This is just one event, I'm sure that there are others, that I 
believe we would be richer knowing about.  So...

	How would people feel about a moderated listing of both events    
announcements *and* descriptions of interesting things seen at events?
Personally, I've always wanted to see  how some of the wonderfully
sounding events I've read about came off, but short of starting an
autocrat's newsletter (a strange concept in itself) I've never been able
to visualize it on a more than local level (where event critiques make
great filler.)  The kingdom newsletters are busy enough as it is, Complete
Anachronist is not quite right, and so on.  But here, I think it would
get enough distribution to matter, and we could also get advance notice of
interesting events too.

	So, what I am proposing, and offering to moderate, is a service.
People could send me event announcements.  This could be thier own events
(preferably, in fact) or events that struck them as interesting from 
Kingdom newsletters.  I would then occationally (as input and usefullness
allow) post them with several in a single posting.  If the notice was too
late to be useful, or if it really is just a generic event (there are such
things) then it wouldn't get posted.  But if it is a event that could be
of sufficient interest to people to get them to travel rediculous distances,
or just so well thought out and described (and novel) to inspire others, then
it would get posted.  

	People could also send me commentaries on events that they have 
attended.  Pure gripes would get bounced.  Generic pats on the back would
get bounced.  Useful ideas, suggestions on how to avoid a particular
problem,  well done theme events (and what made them work) would be the 
kind of thing that would get used.  In time this side of things would
probably generate enough useful tidbits for a CA issue, or perhaps a
TI article.  Certainly I could make the back issues of it FTPable from
one of the sites I have access to (probably ms.uky.edu), so that those
of you looking for ideas could tap it.

	Do people think that this is a worthwhile compromise?  Is anyone
willing to help?  :-)  What does Danulf think?  Do I know what I'm letting
myself in for? (No, wait, I think I know the answer to that one.  :-)

Rebecca, I think you may have missed the point of what both I and Lord
Steffan were trying to say. We're NOT saying that "the SCA should be
Western Europe only and by gum that includes everyone but the Japanese."
We're saying "This person dressed in funny clothes bothers me, but THAT
person dressed in different funny clothes doesn't. How come?" We are trying
to be fair in our acceptance (or non-) of non-European personas and are
mystified as to why some cultures bother us and why some don't.

It seems to me that you are well-named, Milady.

While I'm here, I'd like to bring up something else that's more a pet peeve
than anything else. My dictionary says that the term "Medieval" means
"pertaining to or characteristic of the Middle Ages". To my mind, the
Middle Ages happened in the European area ONLY. (Hold the flames, let me
finish.) The span of time that the Middle Ages occured in happened all over
the world, yes, but the term "Middle Ages" refers to a period of social
history. It is NOT a generic term for the period 600-1600CE.

Think of it in terms of the Chinese Dynasties. The Ming Dynasty did NOT
happen in Europe or the Americas. It is a term that applies to a particular
period of time in a particular geographical area. The Middle Ages (for our
purposes) occured 600-1600CE in the European area. Now, wouldn't it be
consistant for us to restrict our personas to those people who might have
lived during the MIDDLE AGES?

Oh, don't fuss. I just brought this up as a topic of discussion. I don't
intend we DO anything about it.

 Hear Hear!!!  Do the people who complain that it should be an open and 
recognized sca subgroup realize that there were no computers in the middle
ages? I thought the secret society was to exist because we wanted to keep
"secret" ie. not talk about our means of communication >at events< ie. in 
the (current) middle ages.  Such conversation tends to destroy the medievel
illusion, and has been a bit of a problem throughout the society's history.
The secret is, if you like, only secret in persona.  I'm sure many of us
carry news and greetings from the net to non-fisherfolk in our areas, and it's
no secret even to those without access that email and newsgroups exist.

Right now I'm just about the only SCAdian in this whole damn principality
(Hi Henry :-) who reads this group and posts occasionally.  Not too many
SCAfolk have access around here, and I do report on what's happening 
occasionally.  The "mundane" personae know exactly what's happening,
the "medievel" personae know only that I communicate by secret and arcane means
with distant people.  Perhaps we should call it TRISTERO (Read _the crying of lot 49_ 
by Thomas Pynchon) We *KNOW* that this is the 20TH century, and we *know* that
computers exist, but we imagine otherwise at events. Let's keep it that way.

I don't know how you can compress the intended activities of an event
into just a few lines, nay even the page long announcements sometimes
don't do justice!

But in any event if it is to be done it should appear as a seperate
newsgroup & mailing list.  However, moderated newsgroups do not work
well under the alt hierarchy as Gene is unwilling to list addresses
for moderators of moderated alt groups.  Big deal you say?  Well, it
is a big deal for getting Gene's cooperation on something like this
is VERY important to the running of a moderated group.

That again brings up the possibility of moving our operations into
the mainstream of Usenet groups.  Something which I'd tried to do
sometime last summer but fell by the wayside I'm afraid.

Such a move, if it is to happen, would:

-- only affect readers of the newsgroup.  The mailing list would still
   continue functioning as is.
-- expand the potential readership of the newsgroup.  I had a number of
   people tell me before that they CANNOT receive alt groups at their
   site because of one reason or another.  Right now the newsgroup reaches
   65% of Usenet and won't get much higher because it's in alt.
-- Allow some people to unsubscribe from the mailing list, reducing
   the load on .. er .. mc.lcs.mit.edu? .. I think that's the machine.
-- Find new people at places which don't receive alt and haven't otherwise
   heard of us.

I ran a vote on this last summer as some of you may remember.  It fell down
on a couple of points.  First it was summertime, and late summer at that.
Summer means that the students are away and the Usenet population shrinks
quite a bit.  Also students make up a lot of the potential voters on
this subject because lots of SCA people are students.  Summer is a problem
because that's when most of the events happen and people are busy with that,
and late summer is a problem because of Pennsic...

I don't remember how the voting went.  Nor what name preference people had.

How do people feel about this??

I have one.  I cannot vouch for it's accuracy as I've never tried it,
however it comes from a printed collection of wine recipes, the entire
booklet it Copyright (c) 1976 by Raymond Massaccesi, is titled _Winemaker's_
_recipe_handbook_.  It's avaliable for low cost from:

Semplex of U.S.A.
PO Box 11476

About the only thing I would do to this recipe is remove the raisins.
I typed it verbatim from the book and there is no warranty as to fitness
or merchantability of the product described.  All rights reserved :-).

I wasn't going to post it to the newsgroup, but since a third voice
popped up asking for it ...  (This is a cute little booklet, anybody
interested in the recipe for Onion Wine?)

---------------------------> Cut Here <----------------------------------
Rice Wine -- Saki

2 1/2 lb  Rice (husked or raw rice, if available)
  1/2 pt  Grape Concentrate or 1 lb Lt raisins
7     pts Water (hot)
2 1/2 lb  Sugar or Honey
3     tsp Acid Blend
  3/4 tsp Energizer
1         Campden tablet, crushed
1     pkg Sherry Yeast

Method.

1. Wash and coarse crush rice.  Place rice and chopped raisins
   into nylon straining bag, tie top, and place in primary
2. Pour hot water over and stir in all other ingredients EXCEPT yeast
   and energizer.  Cover primary.
3. After 48 hrs add yeast and energizer and cover primary.
4. Stir daily, check Specific Gravity (S.G.) and press pulp lightly.
5. When ferment reaches S.G. 1.050 (2-3 days) add another 1/4 lb
   dissolved sugar per gallon (or 1/4 lb honey, of course).
6. At S.H. 1.030 (6-7 days) strain juice from bag.  Syphon wine off
   sediment into glass secondary.  Attach airlock.
7. At S.G. 1.020 add another 1/4 lb dissolved sugar per gallon.
8. When ferment is complete (S.G. 1.000, about 3 weeks) syphon
   off sediment into clean secondary.  Reattach lock.
9. To aid clearing syphon again in 2 months and again if necessary
   before bottling.

Optional: You may continue to build up alcohol by adding additional
doses of sugar until ferment ceases.  To sweeten add before bottling
1/2 tsp Stabilizer, then, add 1/4 lb dissolved sugar per gallon.

The longer this discussion goes on, the more I wonder about our average
events. Given the wide variation in dress and persona of the core SCA people
I can not find a reason to object to Aztecs, Indians, Amerindians and
pre-Christian Egyptians.

We accept vikings and celts as part of the medieval core regardless of the
lack of chivalrous standards in the culture that they represent. This suggests
that we, the active SCA event goers, are not fussed at the standards of the
persona's culture. The occaisional banishment suggests that we are concerned
that the individuals exhibit chivalrous behaviour.

The concept that I have problems with is the 'non europeans must act as
guests or ambassadors.' If I am a guest, I have a special relationship to my
host. Who is my host at an event? If I am an ambassador, I have a mission and
am 'de facto' a guest of the recipient of my mission. Note that from my point
of view as a celt, I am a 'non-european persona.' Also note that as a celt, I
have strong opinions on the rights, responsibilities, priviledges and duties
of a guest.

The whole thing gets worse at theme events. How can I, an itinerant Irish
craftsman, justify wearing tudor? It takes a strange warping of the persona
to allow this (assuming that I can get some to wear) which could apply to
any other non tudor persona. I can warp my persona as an SCA member but not
as Fiacha the irishman. This has a lot to do with why Fiacha does not have
a well developed personality.

Now for something radical. If the SCA is supposed to empitomise european
medieval culture, we do we not limit crown lists to persona from the time
and place we hold as ideals, i.e. 1150 to 1350 and England, France, Germany,
Spain or Italy. I suppose we could be generous and allow an otherwise
ineligible fighter enter if has champion for a lady from that time and place
and provided that it was recognised that the crown belonged to the lady, not
the fighter (Excuse me. I have to hurry away to my crannog until the 
weather cools).

December 2, 1988

FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Though I am not a direct member of the net, I have been able to catch snippets 
through friends here in balmy Caid.  Through the many pages of opinion and 
information I have received, however, only Lord Robyyan Torr d'Elandris' 
words on Teflon and Kydex armor have evoked the need to write.

First a word of introduction.
My society identity is Brion Thornbird Ap Rhys, Earl, KSCA, OL, Etc.  I have 
a growing business in the Arms and Armour field which grew out of the SCA.

Now on to teflon armour.

I could not agree more with Pobyyan's sentiment that the spirit of SCA 
tournament fighting is not concerned with winning, but rather with the spirit 
of chivalry.

I do not object, as an artisan, to the use of modern materials to produce a
period effect, especially when those materials substantially reduce the cost 
of the effort or are a substitute for a rare period commodity.  For example, 
we find it extremely difficult to recreate the irons used in many period 
armours, but not being an expert in metallurgy and having no such information, 
mild and spring steels suffice.

Nor do I object, as a combatant, to materials which substantially increase the 
safety or durability of our SCA combat equipment.  The example of closed-cell 
foam is instructive.   Fiberglassing on shield extends their life and does not 
offer an appreciable "advantage of Material" as would a plastic shield of the 
same dimensions.  Both are non-period in their material use, yet one recreates 
a period effect and increases the durability while the other merely confers a 
weight advantage coupled with durability.

These non-period materials have application.  We offer the use of Kydex to new 
fighters for body defense, as a temporary measure, given the expense of real 
equipment.  We also advise some of our clients to employ Kydex as a 
supplemental defense under mail or a places such a hips which are difficult 
to defend in a period manner.  In all cases we hope that the offending 
material is treated/covered to preserve the historical atmosphere.

Thank you for enduring my particular brand of soapbox clamor; I would make 
but a parting comment.

Through all of the technical arguments, I would hope that the "Big Picture" 
of our game is not lost: the quest for the spirit of chivalry and the 
enjoyment of good company, and the education of our members in the arts, 
combat, and ideals of the Middle Ages and Renaissance.

After all that time playing "The Venerial Game" the best you could come up

to that term, and I can't say I blame them.  I'm asking the Rialto folks if
they can come up with a better one.  Several other consulting groups were
referred to as a confraternity as well.

I made precisely that mistake when I said I had reservation information

My apologies, good gentle, I didn't catch your name.
YES! Playing cards are period.  I recently had the honor of publishing a
truly well documented article on medieval playing cards in my newsletter
for performing arts, THE JONGLEUR.  For a back issue, send $1 to the Usnail

RE: Limiting SCA events to "Theme Only"
I like autocratting theme events, it gives you a "hook" to hang a lot
of activities on.  Competition for "Best Male Garb in Theme", "Best Female
Garb in Theme", "Best Subtletie in Theme", a quest on the theme, etc.
But asking that the event be closed to people who don't fit the theme is
a bit much.  Prince Morgan's last Coronation (EK), was a Cavalier theme,
and the Cavalier garb that I saw was beautiful.  But a lot of people wouldn't
have attended if non-Cavalier garb wasn't allowed.  Garb like that takes a
long time to make properly.  Large quantities of lace can be expensive.  Not
everybody in the Society can sew that well.  If seeing a Viking or a Samurai
at a SCA event makes you uneasy, maybe you'd better ask yourself if the SCA
is the re-creation group you want to be involved in.

Subject: Observations on the Secret Society

Will everyone please calm down?

Having originated the idea, i feel that it is my right to wade in and
clog the bandwidth at least as much as anyone else.  I will try to be
brief (he blathered interminably)...

Mr. Casey, i believe you are missing several points concerning the
"Secret" society, to the extent that i am not sure you have read the
original posting that suggested it, or several excellent follow-up
articles on the meaning of "secret" and other aspects of inclusion
and exclusion as they relate to a computer-network-based organization,
which this is, and even the use of netting as a recognition sign.
If this is so you'll just have to take my word for it; most of your
objections have already been addressed.

One of my main motivations for steering the discussion towards the
secret society was that it is very, very, very difficult to talk about
computers in an SCA context without *completely* blowing any hope of
maintaining a Middle-ages feeling.  If Japanese persona are jarring,
how much more so are talk of baud rate and disk capacity?  Another is
the utter and complete impossibility of setting membership criteria,
not to mention the lack of desireability of same.  Is someone on the
Internet "entitled" to membership, and therefore to wear "the badge"?
How about Usenet?  How about someone who reads printed copies that
someone else provides?  How about someone who talks regularly with
someone who reads printed copies that someone else provides?  *I*
don't want the overhead associated with anything that would pretend
to adjudicate such things.  Finally there was the simple mechanics
of picking, registering, and providing any sort of Official Token.
What if there aren't enough; am i considered a "non-member" because
i didn't get one?

In short, i thought the discussion was getting silly, so i made a
silly suggestion.  My feelings were shared, apparently, because the
suggestion immedietly took root and florished, nay, became utterly
weed-like, accounting for a HUGE percentage of verbage for several
weeks.  My little chaotic heart went pit-a-pat with the excitement
of a job well done, and i turned my thoughts to other things.

Because i'm afraid that as of now it is a Done Deal.  Even if the whole
group were to agree tomorrow on a device to register with the heralds,
and the heralds passed it the next day, if someone shows up at an
event with a quill pen wrapped in netting, anyone else who has been
reading the digest or subscribing to alt.sca will have strong suspicions
that this person *also* is On The Net.  Sorry, guy, you're in the
Secret Society of People Who Communicate With Each Other Over Computer
Networks, and so is everyone else who is reading this.

And that is the real point.  We want to be able to recognize each other
so that we can argue in person instead of long-distance.  The mechanism
now exists, whether people choose to use it or not, or even whether
people like it or not.  Not to put too fine a point on it, i think the
people who are worried about exclusion or officialness are Taking Things
Too Seriously.  Relax.  Everything is ok, really.

And finally, please take no offence, Mr. Casey.  I have nothing personal
against you; heck, i wouldn't even be able to recognize you.  I simply
disagree with what you posted to the extent that i felt compelled to
reply.

With hopes that this will forstall more traffic than it generates, i am,

To Lord Dagonell and the members of the Rialto:

As a founding (hounding?) member of the UNOFFICIAL Order of the Bassett, I
feel that I must correct Lord Dagonell's statement concerning this
prestigous order (and protect my hide).

The OB is not an order of the Barony of Thescorre.  The fact that most (not
all) inductions are accomplished at Thescorrean events has more to do with
a number of the founding members living in Thescorre than anything else.
In fact, the OB was conceived at a very silly post revel in the Barony of
Concordia many moons ago and has members from all sorts of places in the
East Kingdom (and one in Caid (I think?) - a member who moved there and has
since been King out there and was dutifully yorped into Pennsic War Court a
couple of years ago).

Anyway,  the OB is a VERY unofficial order in the East Kingdom (ie. not
sanctioned by any official in any way and probably avoided even in
mentioning because that is a way of becoming a member - you were stupid
enough to recognize the Order?  Yorp!).  The order exists to recognize
*exquisite* (note the term) stupidity, is a polling order in that we ask
any currently available members whether they think someone is deserving and
if the response is positive, Yorp!  We have since added a badge of sorts --
a set of brown furry bassett ears to be worn suspended from a headpiece
(with sufficiently long ties to fit tin hats like the Tiger Crowns?!).  Our
membership includes a goodly collection of peers of the realm, including
landed and court Barons/esses, Counts, Dukes, Knights, Pelicans, and
Laurels (this may say something about peers but I won't say it!).  You only
become a member once and membership, like all orders, is for life.  Aside
from the founding members (who possess their own brand of stupidity), the
actions that have inducted many of our members range from driving several
hundred miles just to cook an event to taking a killing blow from a tree
(our most recent member) to recognizing the order by calling it into Court
,

The order exists mostly to have fun and primarily to laugh at ourselves.
We try to induct members who have a sufficient sense of humor to laugh at
being a member and to have fun with it.  We hope to have a Bassett reunion
at Pennsic this year, with ears available to any members who don't have
them, and to take one evening to Yorp the encampment.  Feel free to join
us!  (so to speak)

Hmm.  As a stuffy purist, i must, naturally, dissapprove, but in fact everyone

Subject:  Diversity; heralds

Greetings!

I am finding the debate regarding the diversity issue most interesting, in
that this seems to be one of those issues about which people are either *very,
very* pro or *very, very* con.  I have also noticed that strong arguments can
be put forward by both sides.

As I have already come out as being "pro" the only other aspect I'd like to
comment on is with respect to reasons people join the SCA.

One thing years of teaching newcomers has taught me is that while the thought
of being able to live out one's dreams of chivalry, etc. is the most common
reason for joining, it is by no means the *only* reason.  I've met many, many
gentles who joined for entirely different reasons.  For example, I've met a
number of calligraphers and illuminators who joined so they would have a
reason and a forum for pursuing their craft.  Interests in earlier military
history is another, and in certain arts or crafts of an earlier age yet
another.  Everyone's "Dream" (meant in the SCA sense, here) is a little bit
different.  I'm thankful that the SCA is willing to accomodate these different
rationales for joining, apart from the diversity issue.  I haven't gotten
involved in other forms of re-enactment, such as the American Civil War,
because the role of females in these forums is often restricted.  I couldn't
pursue my major interests there as I can in the SCA.

Regarding the remarks about heralds in digest #207:  as a Trimarian herald of
some 11+ years standing, I would very much like to know what the "serious
Heraldic problems" are supposed to be.  As I'm not terribly good at
re-arranging BANG! addresses to suit my computer system here, I would
appreciate a direct reply from Korwyn Ariannaid or Nikolai Gornych (note:
please cite an address I can use in replying).

Often the heralds are used in messenger type roles.  And for that matter
in period the herald type people did far more than what you say.  As a
diplomat messenger go-between type person heralds must be able to have
some sort of diplomatic immunity.  Often, in order to deliver messages,
a herald would have to be admitted to enemy encampments, a dangerous
proposition for someone who normally actively works FOR a particular lord.
Instead heralds were/are accorded diplomatic immunity and in exchange they
are expected to be impartial.

I don't have my heralds handbook handy or I would go re-read the list
of duties.  However there are many more duties than what you list,
more along the lines of what I imply.

Any factual errors are due to it being 2 AM.

A Message from a friend
They Shall Reap as They Sow.....
As of January 1st, AS 23, there are serious Heraldic problems in Three
Kingdoms (Atenvelt, An Tir and Trimaris).  Mostly the problems seem to stem
from the view taken by a number of heralds that they owe service to the
church (College of Arms) rather than to their employer (Baron, King etc...).
My opinion is that the mission of the college of arms is two fold.  First to
keep track of the arms each member of the gentry has.  The second is to
provide a human public address system and disseminate information for their
employer.  That is it.  The increasing concept that the college is separate
from the realms leads to the antagonistic us vs them attitude seen in many
of the relations between heralds and the populace.
I am looking for a way to restore the balance here not just flaming off.
Anyone out there who wants to respond feel free.

Sticking to the spirit of the thing, that is, the sca was designed to be
fun, is what makes it work. If you can't tolerate someone's garb that is
non-european but period, they you are actively working to not make it work.

Like I said, remember why it's there.

Visitor?
Visitor, you say?

Hun, this is AMERICA, and if you ain't a visitor then you are an
American Indian! We're ALL visitors in the SCA.

Some have chosen Europeans because they are glamorous, but let's not
talk this "visitor" crap. There's so many cultures and time periods
represented even at a local meeting, much less an event, that we are
all visitors.

Not always! My first event was Khan Quest in Tennessee. It was great
oriental event. We even had oriental dancers (very young) at the feast.

I agree wholeheartedly. The SCA is great because it is two things:
medieval history, and fun. So far it seems to be going ok. If it loses
either of these, though, it will surely fail.

In SCA Digest #204, milady Rebecca the Contrary had several postings,
all of which I wholeheartedly disagree with. Thus, here are some ripostes:

Secret Society: Milady Rebecca, I hope you are aware of that the "Secret
Society" thing is a joke? Certainly, we aren't trying to create a *seriously*
secret and exclusive group. The reason to call it a secret society is that
computers aren't period, so an "SCA Computer Club" would clearly be out of
line. We cannot be a college, a guild of any of the other common types of
interest groups within the Society because computer networks are outside
the type of activities we can do within the SCA. Since the SCA network still
exists, making us out as a secret society is a perfect way to avoid this
conflict. It doesent mean we wld exclude people. It just means we are labeling
these non-period things "secret" because they're not part of what the SCA does.

Non-European personas: Sorry, but the fact that there *were* middle ages in
China and India (or even on the Moon) does not force the SCA to study or
re-enact them. It remains a fact that too much diversity in personae makes
it impossible to create an illusion of medieval society - that which most
of us call "The Dream". Now, we already have an extremely liberal policy
on the time line (600-1600 AD), which may occasionally be a problem. But
this is certainly no reason to make things even *worse* by also introducing
Chinese, Africans and Cherokee personae.

I believe that most people were attracted to the society because they wanted
to play and act out their fantasies and dreams about the age of Chivalry. 
Not because they wanted to study ancient oriental cultures. I, for one, am
here to play and devote myself to a bit of good-natured escapism from the
20th Century. I am here to live out my dreams of chivalry, courtesy, feudalism
and knightly glory. I would not dream of trying to hinder someone from doing
the same with Samurai, Indian, Chinese or African cultures. But is it neces-
sary to do it right here? 

Event announcements: How about avoiding these altogether on this net. I am
reading this in Sweden, via a 300 baud modem, and it is not interesting
to learn that the Barony of Down-in-the-Mire is having a Bear Shaving
Contest (B.Y.O.B.) next saturday. Any such message, no matter how short,
takes time and disk space that can be used better.

I have very strong feelings on this subject (would you please hand me my
flame resistant burnoose, thanks.)

I am an Arab in the year 1197 of the Christian calendar (595 of the Muslem).
I am currently fighting in what the Franks call the "Third Crusade".  This is 
the third time that the invaders from the northern european lands have attacked
my countrymen and I, leaving nothing but death and destruction in their wake,
to attempt to conquer a a small piece of land that they have had peaceful access
to all along.  This "Crusade" is being led, jointly, by Richard Plantaganet (The
Lionhearted), King of England, and Philip, King of France.

There will be several more of these "Crusades" during the time period that 
the SCA encompasses.  My point in all of this (yes there is a point) is that
in attempting to exclude non-european personas from the SCA is not only
discouraging to those of us who are non-european personas, but also eliminates
those european personas who are or deal with crusaders.  

Also, I maintain that non-europeans are not visitors, but are an integral and
important part of the SCA.  The period of the "Crusades" take up a significant 
portion of the SCA time "period".  

Well, I think I have ranted long enough about this (for now).  My humblest
apologies to those whom I have offended, but I felt compeled to make my
feelings known.

My memory is that the English used the bill primarily and that the Scots used
the spear in their schiltrons.  In the late 15th and 16th century, of course,
everyone tried to use pikes like the Swiss with varying effectiveness.  The
one picture I can remember of pikemen in formation showed them with pikes
of equal length but with the ranks behind the front positioning their heads
above those of the front rank, which were essentially leveled.  The spear
was used in tournament in the form known as "at the barriers", where the
combatants fought with two barriers preventing them from advancing or from
thrusting low.  Special armor with a skirt on "tonlet" was used for the
barriers; there is a picture of one in Claude Blair's book European
Armour.

Subject:  Reply to complaints about "Secret Society"; Attn:  Dagonell

Greetings and a Happy New Year to All!

I could not help noticing (how could anyone miss it?) that Digest #204
consisted largely of complaints regarding the "Secret Society" (and attendant
insignia) idea.

Of those gentles who complained I would ask, "Where the hell did your sense of
humor go?"  Just about everyone who's followed these discussions over the last
several weeks has kept the smiley faces firmly in mind.  *No one* has
suggested seriously forming some sort of closed clique!  All that's been
happening, really, is an attempt to come to a consensus regarding a ***FUN***
way of identifying ourselves, especially to each other.  All other comments
have been satirical, or a parody.  After all, when Pennsic, or later on the
Argent Anniversary, rolls around, it'll be nice to be able to attach faces to
the node addresses!


_Re:_ Dagonell's comments-- I agree!  In my opinion, few things could be ruder
than lack of consideration for the performers who give of their own time for
your amusement!

In all fairness to the audience (and because I can't resist being a pain...),
it must also be noted that many halls have execrable acoustics.  When the
people at the other end of the hall can't tell what's going on, they see no
reason to be quiet, and the next thing you know...  This is why, when giving
advice to budding autocrats and hall stewards, I tell them to keep the
entertainment to the "strolling minstrel" variety.  To my thinking, it's far
more successful, and doesn't require everyone in the hall being quiet.  This
in no way lessens the accuracy of Lord Dagonell's remarks, however.


By the way:  Dagonell, every time I try to mail you something, it bounces

	You can't tell an SCA person not to do anything he/she wants to do for 
any reason because he/she won't listen to you, but sticking to what SCA people 
are used to is what makes the sca work.  Most of us want to recreate the 
culture of the european middle ages and rennaissance, and as long as that is 
what most of us want, we will continue to muddle along and do as good a job of 
it as we have been doing.  There will always be something to shock the purist, 
but we can take in our stride the occasional "visitor" from a foreign culture 
in the same way we accomodate people who wear tudor gowns with zippers up the 
back, or elizebethan slashed-sleeve gowns with no underdress, or egregiously 
commercial-looking trim on their t-tunics, or peasant blouses and skirts with 
no bodice, or jongleurs playing modern instruments, or fighters in decorator 
avocado carpet armor..............eventually the "visitor" will be assimilated 
and find that SCA garb is best for SCA activities, or else he/she will drop 
out, or else he/she wont.  The *atmosphere* will still be european 
medieval/renn and there will still be the occasional moment when it's all 
real.

	if the SCA ceases to have a core concept that most people 
can grasp or are interested in, then the SCA will fall appart and cease to 
exist as a medieval/renassance recreaction organization.  If we try to 
regulate what people can & cannot do and wear by law, rather than by custom 
and consensus, we will only ensure that the SCA will cease to exist as a group 
of people who have fun together as well.

Subject: Performers and Hecklers


Dagonell the Juggler writes about his dislike for hecklers at
performances.  As a sometimes storyteller I must disagree, sometimes
the hecklers, if they are good natured can actually be an asset.  

As I am sure Dagonell must know, being a Juggler, one of the first
things you must learn is how to recover a droped ball gracefully,
making it look like it might have been part of the act.  An act with a
graceful fumble in it looks almost as good as a clean one, and is
certainly the best we can anticipate without being willing to pay top
dollar for professionals.  When I make a blunder in a story, a gentle
heckle can turn it into a joke at my expense, (sometimes I heckle
myself if there is no other person supplying the honors), I then weave
that back into the story I was telling and procede from there, very
little the worse for wear.  The more I think about it, the more I feel
that must have truly been a part of performing in the middle ages,
where the noblemen would have no problems with heckling the poor fool
who was trying to entertain them.

Of course this is rough on a new performer.  It takes practice in
front of an audience to gain the poise you need to laugh at your own
mistakes.  Perhaps an event is not the proper forum for this kind of
thing.  In Carolingia, we are in the processes of forming a
storytellers guild (although we welcome Harpers and other performers
to our practice).  The idea is that anyone is free to attend and tell
a story, or just listen, but that this is a practice, so it doesn't
matter if you are a little rusty or make a lot of mistakes.  The
audience give you feedback about the story, and also provides you with
practice against the hecklers.  As they are all (for the most part)
performers too, they will know to be gentle on the first timers.  I
have seen many heasitant stutters turn into confident yarners who can
engage in witty repartie with the rest of the room (there are
typically many wits there, but they often send half on vacation).
Maybe you should institute some system like that in your area to help
novice performers.

May all your heckles be assessts.

	The European middle ages were characterized by:

	pre-industrial technology that was bronze-age or later
	the feudal system of government in which the man was bound to overlord

	a  warrior caste with a warior code of right conduct which was highly

If I may put in my two pence worth...

The new principality of Ealdormere (sp?) (Northern Canada) use "Wassail"
as they have laid claim to the North Pole, hence it's always Christmas.

Whenever anyone from the Friedland Legion Artillery Company (the folks who
fire the cannon at Pennsic) receive an award, the usual cheer is:
"Vivat! Vivat! Vivat! Ka-boom!"

The Barony of the Rhydderich Hael which frequently gives out a prize scroll
for Most Flair, or Best Death as well as for first place in the tourney,
usually cheers the Best Death with : "Mortat! Mortat! Mortat!"

The Barony of Thescorre, which has the Order of the Basset for those
individuals whose mistakes are suitable for bardic campfire tales (You left
your armour where, Your Grace?) frequently have people cheering "Yorp! Yorp!"
when someone new is inducted.

   Now that's wonderful.  Nothing like wanting newcomers and people already
hooked up to the net to know about us.  We should also have certain foods that
only we could eat together and certain shoes that we should wear and remember
we should all WALK the same too.


This is getting a little ridiculous people.  I don't mind the idea of wearing
something similar (though a net is more commonly used than one would think)
merely to find someone that I have something in common with but when you get
involved in passwords and signals, you can count me out!

   This seems awfully silly to me.  I'd rather wear a nice badge that people

     Don't give anything else because you aren't used to them?  That's the 
attitude I'm getting.  I don't think that you can tell someone not to have
a persona froma different country or even not to wear clothing from a country
you've just been visiting because SCA'ers aren't USED to it.  The main reason 
I joined this group is because it seemed to PROMOTE  the STUDY of these medieval
ages and sorry, but medieval ages happened all over the world.  When you start
saying "it's okay to have medieval people from this country but not this 
country then to me, the whole point is lost to closed-mindedness.

Subject: Secret Society is a Bad Idea
Message-Id: <10764@s.ms.uky.edu>

If you want a secret society, then have one, but don't make it an
official part of SCA.

I want there to be a SCA group specifically for those who are on
computer networks, and thus those that have the ability to send
electronic mail to each other. This opens all kinds of possibilities
for contacting and notifying people.

I want this group to be open, with a catchy, easily recognizable,
approved badge. Thus even if they didn't know about it, both netters
and non-netters might find out about it from inquiries about the badge.
And DON'T wear fishnet! Fishnet would be inappropriate for many
costumes. Imagine a woman in a fancy Tudor dress with a fishnet belt.

The idea of a "secret society" stinks of an all too common closed
minded attitude I have seen among some computer professionals (remember
the hacking book "The Inner Circle??", same thing). Whether or not it
was intended, it is there, and people that are tired of dealing with
snotty superior attitude computer people are going to be turned off
right away by the "secret" part.

I also disapprove of the use of any term having to to with fishing when
naming this group. Certainly computer networks are the basis for the
thing, but let's keep the "net" part and not the fishing part. Call it
the Connection Group, or the Ethereal Domain, but not the "Fishermen".
Gag. Let's keep it open, in the spirit of the society.

Subject: Personae in General

CEO summary:
In article <65350ABC102@PSUVM>, Alex Clark (Henry of Maldon) voices 
his ideas on the diversification of personae in the SCA.  As I 
understand it, the SCA period begins at or around the fall of Rome 
(roughly 480 AD).  In the real Middle Ages, a 9th-century Viking is 
just as likely to meet a samurai as he is a 16th-century cavalier.  
If you're truly interested in maintaining "purity" in an SCA scenario,
the best you can hope to do in the "current Middle Ages" is to sponsor
events where people are requested to come in the garb of the period.
Even then, you can't close your doors to people who want to attend, 
but only have garb from another period.  (I know I'd probably stay 
away from any event where it was made known that Dark Ages Celts need 
not apply.  I'd probably stay away from all other events in that area 
too -- attitude counts for a lot.)
 
I would certainly like to see more people from different places in 
our time period, but for other reasons.  I don't know too many 
Saracens or Chinese or Turks, but I'd certainly like to know more 
about them for reasons of scholarship.  Certainly my persona never 
would have met any of these people, but they're as much a part of the 
Current Middle Ages as I am.  Relax and enjoy the diversity.

1.) Realize that the people who know better (your fellow calligraphers and

2.) Use less gold on your scrolls.  The more gold you use, the more light it

the back of court, the more likely some moron will start the rest of them off.

a word and then being laughed at is NOT an enjoyable experience.  Personally,
my hide is thick enough that one moron isn't going to ruffle my feathers that
much.  I'm also sufficiently glib-tongued that I can turn the insult back on
the heckler and make them the butt of their own joke about one time out of 
three.  A first-time performer doesn't have that kind of thick hide or 
experience.  Someone heckling them could be an experience so tramatic as to
make them quit performing or quit the SCA.  

Please folks, think twice before you voice your 'bon mot'.  At least limit
it to those performers who can handle being heckled.	*** FLAME OFF ***

Subject: Non-European Personas

In a recent discussion, Baron Stephan Silverwing has suggested that 
those of us who play non-European personas "never" act as visitors
to the European mileau, but choose always to dress in their native
garb. Come now!  I play the role of a half-Chinese/ half Turkoman
military officer born to a Mandarin and a concubine/slave at the 
beginning of the 13th century. Having run into some difficulties 
with a distant member of the Imperial Sung family, I fled to Korea,
and then by a series of accidents, to Japan.  After two years there,
I was forced to leave again, once again with Korean fishermen.  Having
mastered a smattering of the Malay trade tongue and a bit of Arabic,
and having learned something about the waters surrounding the Malay
peninsula, I was engaged by Moslem traders (common at the time) as
a translater/pilot. Converted to the Islamic faith at swordpoint, I
travelled with these traders to the East coast of Africa, and then
to the holy land. I made my way to Europe along established trade
routes, assisted by pilgrims and merchants, from whom I learned a
little French, and a good deal of English.
        After healing the wounds of an unhorsed knight in Britanny,
I was mistaken for a chirurgeon.  It paid well, and I became personal
chirurgeon to a British Earl, my present liege lord. Converted to the
teachings of Holy Mother Church at my liege`s command, I have since
become a worshipful Christian squire. I dress in tunics and hanging
oversleeves, and am working on a fine suit of chainmail. I do my best
to be chivalrous to all ladies, although I do not understand why,
but orders are orders. Insofar as I can, I have become acculturated
into European society, believing it better to be a great lord in a
barbarian kingdom than a renegade exile in the greatest country on
earth.
        It is true that I eat with chopsticks, occasionally wear
Chinese garb for court occasions,and am perhaps not the most fervent
Christian that ever trode the ground of the holy land, but I am as
European as you are, and as Chinese as it is safe to be. So I go

Subject: Non-European Personas

In a recent discussion, Baron Stephan Silverwing has suggested that 
those of us who play non-European personas "never" act as visitors
to the European mileau, but choose always to dress in their native
garb. Come now!  I play the role of a half-Chinese/ half Turkoman
military officer born to a Mandarin and a concubine/slave at the 
beginning of the 13th century. Having run into some difficulties 
with a distant member of the Imperial Sung family, I fled to Korea,
and then by a series of accidents, to Japan.  After two years there,
I was forced to leave again, once again with Korean fishermen.  Having
mastered a smattering of the Malay trade tongue and a bit of Arabic,
and having learned something about the waters surrounding the Malay
peninsula, I was engaged by Moslem traders (common at the time) as
a translater/pilot. Converted to the Islamic faith at swordpoint, I
travelled with these traders to the East coast of Africa, and then
to the holy land. I made my way to Europe along established trade
routes, assisted by pilgrims and merchants, from whom I learned a
little French, and a good deal of English.
        After healing the wounds of an unhorsed knight in Britanny,
I was mistaken for a chirurgeon.  It paid well, and I became personal
chirurgeon to a British Earl, my present liege lord. Converted to the
teachings of Holy Mother Church at my liege`s command, I have since
become a worshipful Christian squire. I dress in tunics and hanging
oversleeves, and am working on a fine suit of chainmail. I do my best
to be chivalrous to all ladies, although I do not understand why,
but orders are orders. Insofar as I can, I have become acculturated
into European society, believing it better to be a great lord in a
barbarian kingdom than a renegade exile in the greatest country on
earth.
        It is true that I eat with chopsticks, occasionally wear
Chinese garb for court occasions,and am perhaps not the most fervent
Christian that ever trode the ground of the holy land, but I am as
European as you are, and as Chinese as it is safe to be. So I go
on serving my liege lord's interests as best I can, and bathe a little
more often than most,and honor my *one* lady wife (now there`s a
silly custom), and try to keep the inquisitor far, far away from me.

Subject: "pikes"

I have heard much of late on the net regarding standards for "pikes"
and polearms in various kingdoms throughout the society, and there
seems to be a good deal of confusion here regarding the nomenclature
of hafted weapons. Although others have attempted, correctly, to clear
up this mess, they seem to have failed, so here goes:
        There were many types of hafted weapons (things stuck on a pole)
in use in the middle ages, and their use continued throughout
Elizabethan times, and even after.
The same names were often used at different times and in different
locales to describe the same weapon. Conversely, different names were
often used to describe weapons that were functionally the same.
Historians and translaters have further confused the issue, as few of 
them are familiar with the use of such arms, or their evolution, mostly
from farm implements. The Oxford English dictionary defines a pike as
"A weapon consisting of a long wooden shaft with a pointed head of iron
or steel; formerly the chief weopon of a large part of the infantry; in
The 18th century superseded by the bayonet."  This word is first found in
16th century commentary, and is believed to derive from the same root
as the Fr. piquer, to pierce or puncture.  This is apparently not
related to the English usage of pike to mean a summit or conical
mountain.
        Many polearms consist of variously edged, pointed, hooked
multi-purpose heads.  They vary from five to twelve feet in length,
depending on the period, their intended use, and the availability of
wood. The best known types are: halberd, glaive, bill, and spetum.
There are *many* other types. For a functionally flawed but none-
theless useful article, I recommend E. Gary Gygax`s article,
"The Nomenclature of Polearms", which is presented as an appendix
to the Dungeons and Dragons game aid "Unearthed Arcana", which
comes with its own bibliography.
        For the record, a pike is a long spear, with a shaft varying
in length from ten to eighteen feet, and averaging twelve to
fourteen feet in length.  It was the mainstay of the English army
throughout the Hundred Years War, and was intended for infantry to
use in ranks, primarily against armored cavalry. While Scottish and
English pike units were reknowned for their tenacity in the face of
a cavalry charge, it is the Swiss who became best known for their
pikemen, as they alone seem to have mastered the art of *moving*
in formation, with pikes of varying lengths forming stepped ranks
of pointy nastiness. In spite of mistranslation and confusion, the
pike has *never* been a weopon with a cutting edge, or one viable
for single combat.

If I may put in my two pence worth...

The new principality of Ealdormere (sp?) (Northern Canada) use "Wassail"
as they have laid claim to the North Pole, hence it's always Christmas.

Whenever anyone from the Friedland Legion Artillery Company (the folks who
fire the cannon at Pennsic) receive an award, the usual cheer is:
"Vivat! Vivat! Vivat! Ka-boom!"

The Barony of the Rhydderich Hael which frequently gives out a prize scroll
for Most Flair, or Best Death as well as for first place in the tourney,
usually cheers the Best Death with : "Mortat! Mortat! Mortat!"

The Barony of Thescorre, which has the Order of the Basset for those
individuals whose mistakes are suitable for bardic campfire tales (You left
your armour where, Your Grace?) frequently have people cheering "Yorp! Yorp!"
when someone new is inducted.

I got that tenor on Diana of Greenwood's recommendation.  The tone really is
that good, and for a decent tenor it's *very* cheap.  I don't find it
light-weight at all though (but then, I'm used to the smaller instrument).  It
has a key for the low C which means that that note is easy to reach, but the
price is the absence of a low C#.  (You can fake it by blowing the low D very
softly :-)  Overall, although it's an instrument with problems, if you're
looking for a tenor recorder and not planning to spend many hundreds of dollars,
this is the one to get.

Whereas it is virtually impossible to find a plastic soprano recorder with a
pleasing sound, this is not true of the larger instruments.

Subject: assorted comments

I've been snowed under so I'm only now getting around to answering a few 
things.

1. I am *STRONGLY* in favor of non-european personnas as an 
integral part of the society.  The argument has been proposed that
the average medieval person would not have met anyone from another
country.  Actually they would not have met anyone from elsewhere in their 
own country.  
There is documented proof thet there was contact in the
middle ages, with African and Arabic peoples (remember the Crusades?)
The Arabs had extensive trade routes running through India and China,
and through China, Japan.  The Islamic Empire reached as far as southern
France (see what happes when you Franks try to make war on us in our own
country) and the Russian Steppes. IMNSHO there is no way to exclude 
non-european personnas unless you change the time period of the Society.

2. I have been fighting for 10 years & it has been my experience that a
lighter weapon weilded with more force will do less unintentional damage 
than a heavier one with less force.  This is especially true with spears
where accuracy is even more important.  I am much more afraid of a rattan
spear that wobbles than a hardwood spear that snaps.  (I have been hit by 
both and still prefer the hardwood)  

3. Someone asked about Concordians on the net, well here I am.

I think I have rambled on long enough,  discussion invited, flames unwelcome.

Lords and ladies.

While it's true that there were Middle Ages in all parts of the world,
I still find it disturbing to meet Chinese, Cherokee or Massai persons
at SCA events. Perhaps this has to do with why I got into the SCA in the
first place; what it was that I wanted.

I guess that a lot of people are in the SCA chiefly to meet nice and
interesting people. You like to dress up, you are interested in cultural
history. The SCA is perfect, and non-Europeans are as OK here as they 
would be anywhere else, because the most important thing is that everybody
is having a good time.

That was not the main reason why I joined. I grew up with sagas about
knights and dragons, heroes and princesses. My childhood was full of
Ivanhoe, Robin Hood, Richard the Lionhearted, Arthur and the Knights
of the Round Table, and all the rest of them. My head was full of images
from films I had seen; tournaments with pavillions and flying banners,
knights in shining armor, battles and prodigous feasts in vaulted halls,
gregorian chants in gothic cathedrals. 

We kids often played games where we imagined ourselves to be the heroes
from films, books and TV. Sometimes it was Cowboys and Indians, sometimes
it was World War II, and sometimes it was Knights or Vikings. We dressed
up as best as we could, and acted it out. But when I grew up, I found new
inspiration on a more adult level. I still wanted to have that magical
experience, to be *there*. I wanted to re-create all the wonderful scenes
my imagination created. That is why I joined the SCA: because I wanted
to play Knights again, and transfer myself to the Time of Chivalry and 
Glory. 

Thus, literature and film are my sources of inspiration. The images they
evoke in my mind are what I want to create in reality. We can never escape
the 20th century entirely, but with a little help of the imagination it is
possible to get very close, at least for a few brief, shining moments, when
it all becomes *real*.

Now, if the kids were playing Cowboys and Indians and I appeared in my
Viking outfit, they would cry "go home and change!", and I would quickly
change my appearance to fit into the context. I feel the same whenever
I meet a Samurai or Indian in the SCA. I feel like telling them "go home
and change! You are not in this book!" I would react the same way if they
came as World War II soldiers, or Wild West gunslingers. Time is not the
only important aspect here. Geography is also important. 

I would dress up as a Samurai or an Indian, anytime, and transfer myself
to their world. I would love it. But I don't want brandy in my whisky,
I don't want beef in my icecream, and I don't want out-of-context people
in my Middle Ages.

Yours, William de Corbie

Unto all upon whose retinas these photons do impinge, greetings.
Long before I discovered the SCAnet, I had been working to form
a Known-World-wide guild of folks who discuss and debate issues
affecting us as members of the organization -- how the SCA affects
our lives and how we individually and collectively affect the SCA...
the sort of things that are being discussed here.
We held two organizational meetings at the Pennsic War, and have 
decided to gather and publish articles, tractates, monographs, and rants
in a (at least) annual journal, to be issued at each Pennsic. Also, at
each Pennsic we will choose a new "featured theme" for the next year. Articles
on any subject of "SCA-philosphy" are welcome, but those on the feature theme
are especilayy encouraged.
This year's theme (from an idea of Duke Cariadoc's) is as follows:
Examine the matter of "Medieval (i.e., strict historical accuracy) vs.
"Medieval-ish" (i.e., that which "feels Medieval enough" for the game).
Another way of looking at this is to consider to what extent the SCA recreates
an actual historical culture vs. the degree to which "SCA" is a culture unto
itself, perhaps with vague affinities to actual historical fact.
Papers may be sent (HARDCOPY ONLY -- DON'T SEND VIA E-MAIL!!!) to me at
Steven H. Mesnick
90 Bowdoin St.
Malden, MA-02148-5850

Dependding upon respopnse, we may circulate papers among a "jury" which will
decide which to publish.

(in no particular order): Lord Hawkwind of Skara Brae, Duke Cariadoc, Justin

	Also, there was some contact with Japan via Portugal and Spain in

culture, very similar to europe of the time, with the equivalent of Knights/
Lords/etc (samurai, daimyo).  Most of these other cultures are more different
from europe than japan was.

Unto all folk of the Rialto, from Arval Benicoeur, Brigantia Principal
Herald, Greetings.

In the Winter "Tournaments Illuminated," the lady Laurel Queen of Arms
published a poll of the populace.  She has asked for opinions and
commentary on three significant issues.  Unfortunately, some details
of these issues have not be clearly explained, and I would offer a few
thoughts.

In general, I urge everyone to consider these issues and to respond
to Mistress Alisoun's poll, so that she can make the most informed
decision possible.

The discussion that follows is long, and I apologize for that.
However, I thought it best to try to state the issues as clearly as
possible. 


1) Concerning the registration and protection of household names.

The College of Arms currently will register the name of a household if
it is submitted with a household badge.  Up until very recently,
little protection was given to household names.  Technically, they
were protected from conflict with group names, other household names,
and with personal names, but in practice, checking for such conflicts
was difficult and uneven.  In the past year of so, Mistress Alisoun
has re-interpretted the rules on protecting household names from
conflict, and has instituted the following one-way protection:

Household names, when submitted, may not conflict with registered
household names, branch names, or order names.  Once a household name
is registered, it will be protected from conflict with new branch
names, household names, order names, and personal names.

Note the one-way protection versus personal names.  In practice, this
means that you can register "House Benicoeur" as long as I haven't
registered it first.  However, if I have registered "House Benicoeur",
then no one else may use the surname "Benicoeur" without my
permission.  In the case of a rare surname like this, the rule makes
sense.  Indeed, in principle, this may be exactly the sort of
protection which might make sense for household names.  However,
suppose your name were "William of Greenwood".  If you registered
"House Greenwood", no one could ever register the surname "Greenwood"
or "of Greenwood" or "of the Green Wood" or "du Bois Vert" or "von
Grunwald", et cetera.

The problem becomes even more convoluted when we note that there are
some very odd household names registered.  For example, in olden days,
we registered household names "House Smith" and "Caer Llewellyn". It
is hard to justify refusing to allow the surname "Smith" or the
patronymic "ap Llewellen"!

On the other hand, would you like to see someone registering the name
Lothar von Halsstern or Walter Oldcastle or Arthur of Bellatrix (or
fill in the name of the most important household in your area!)  It
seems pointless to register household names without giving them this
sort of protection.

The question, therefore, is how to resolve the desire to protect
household names with the problems inherent in protecting the ones
we've already got on the books.  The four options listed in TI are the
most straightforward possible solutions.  However, other solutions
should be suggested if you think they are valid.


2) Concerning Alternate Persona Names

The College currently will register an alternate persona name if it is
submitted with a badge for that alternate persona.  Alternate persona
names are judged by the same standards as primary names.

This issue is pretty clearly stated in TI: Should we register such
names at all, and if we do, should we require that they be linked to
badges, or should they be allowed as separate submissions.  Note that
if the College stops registering such names, it in no way hinders
people from using them.  They just wouldn't be officially protected.


3) Concerning Non-human names

Under the long-standing policy of the College of Arms, an SCA name may
not be a name used only by non-humans in period or in literature, and
a byname may not be such as to imply non-human birth or powers.

Examples of the former are names like Gandalf, Grendel, Thor, Dylan,
Gloin, and so on.  The class includes names of non-humans such as
dwarves, elves, monsters, giants, gods and goddesses.  The question is
simply this: Should SCA members be allowed to register a name which
was only used in period as the name of such a being?

Examples of the latter class are "the Elf", "the Dwarf", "the
Magician", "Thunderbringer", "the Tuchux" and so on.  Should SCA
members be allowed to register names which imply that they are more
than human, other than human, or have non-human powers?

The options listed in TI state the case pretty well.  Again,
discussion is welcome, as well as votes.


If I can answer any other questions on these issues, please send them
to me.  I will be happy to reply, or to post replies if they are of
general interest.

Yours in service to the Society,


	Arval, Brigantia.

A while back, after the Pennsic War, I got a letter from their (then)

the Known World Chorus at the war, and that they would like to buy the
tape I had (the only one in existance) of the two performances the
chorus had done (this year and last). Since I have no tape, nor had I
heard of one I wrote them saying this. I put an announcement in
_Pikestaff_, the newsletter of the East, but heard no response, so now
I post this question:

is there a tape of the performances, can it be gotten, and from whom?

I would send cash, or tapes and cash for postage, and would truly like
to find this supposed tape. Please send me any information you have to

Subject: Problems with recent TIs

Greetings unto the ladies and lords of the Rialto, from Siobhan
Medhbh O'Roarke, Wearing her Society Chronicler cap.
 
I've gotten a lot of questions about the late Fall TI, and want to
talk about what's happening and what's going to happen here where
you all can see.
 
Seneschals and other group officers and members, please feel free to
take this and distribute to your groups, as this is information for
all.
 
I recently received a letter from Lord Bertrik, who lives in the
Netherlands. I am printing his letter here as a jumping off spot for
my comments, as he put the case very succinctly and effectively.

Lord Bertrik is very right. There were problems both with production
and printing/mailing, and we've taken steps to correct those. You
may have seen that the Winter TI was mailed only two weeks or so
after the Fall TI. That's because we were determined to get the
Winter TI out on time -- mailed in the first week of the cover date
month!
 
We changed editors and art directors of TI last year. Shortly after
this change, we discovered that the new art director's job
responsibilities had changed, and that he didn't have as much time
to do TI as he had hoped. He continued to struggle on and try to get
the magazine out, and did some very useful things for us (such as
redesigning the magazine and getting a new stock of art work in-
house to be used). Finally, in mid-May, it became obvious that his
work obligations were not going to allow him to continue as art
director, and he resigned.
 
Just after he resigned we discovered that the last set of boards he
had sent to the printers had been damaged by the commercial carrier
who had them. This was not good news, as it meant that in the middle
of a job transfer to another state and other nastinesses in the
non-SCA world, our art director had to reset much of the type and
rekeyline the entire piece. Some of the artwork was damaged beyond
rescue and had to be redone. Thus, the Summer issue was delayed over
a month.
 
The Fall issue is normally produced in July/Aug. Lady Rosalinde and
I decided that we would do this issue between the two of us, in
order to not have to wait for a new Art director. Catastrophe befell
us -- I was out of work 10 days with a stomach flu and then testing
for a supposed heart problem, and Lady Rosalinde developed
gestational diabetes and was hospitalized for that. A former art
director offered to take on our poor orphan, and we shipped
everything off to her. At that point TI was only about 2 weeks late,
which we thought we could make up.
 
Our volunteer had almost the entire issue finished when her lord was
transfered to a new job suddenly. She sent the boards back to me,
needing only artwork. I gave them to a professional typesetter to
finish pasting up, as I suffered a threatened miscarriage at that
point and was flat on my back in bed. The boards reached the print
house 3 weeks late, but we had missed our printing window. The
printer promised us a mailing date of October 25, which was pushing
things. We normally have a 6 week turnaround for printing.
 
(Note: I'll talk more about printing and deadlines later in this
posting.)
 
This poor misbegotten Fall issue had more problems once we sent it
to the Printer. Not only had we missed our window, but a set of
silverprints (a proof set of pages) got lost between the printers
and the editor. This delayed things for another week. We were now
looking at a mailing date of November 10. Not good.
 
At any rate. after a number of similar problems, the printer finally
got the Fall issue mailed late in November. You should all have it
in hand by now.
 
The Winter issue was handled by me and a professional type house in
East Lansing, MI, after Lady Rosalinde chose the articles. Lady
Rosalinde couldn't do this issue, because she was busy having her
baby a month prematurely. The typesetters and I worked long hard
hours on Winter, determined to get it out in time. And despite some
problems with the printers, we did manage to get it mailed only a
week late. You should have it in hand shortly, if you haven't gotten
it already.
 
We discovered in the course of this travail that the printers we
were using weren't concerned about our mailing deadlines, and that
if our job were a month or more late, it wasn't a problem for them.
Getting TI out on time has been a major priority for Lady Rosalinde
and I, and after negotiations and soul-searching, we have decided to
change printers to one who will give us a guaranteed mailing date,
and who wants only 3 weeks lead time, as well.
 
This will be a good change for you, the members and readers, because
a reduced lead time means we can print more timely articles and news
from the officers and BOD. We probably won't change the deadlines
much at first, because we need to get used to a new schedule. But
we're determined that we won't have another year like this one.
 
We are also sending the type to a typehouse who can turn around Lady
Rosalinde's diskettes in 5 days, and who can take her marked-up
galleys and return the type the second time with the pages formatted
to her specifications. This means less layout time, and a faster
turnaround. Let's use the technology to our advantage, right? Since
we haven't found an art director, we need to use the resources we
have to keep TI looking professional and well-done, while not taxing
the single-time volunteers more than we need to.
 
And even with this, we will be under budget with TI because of
volume discounts. That's good luck and good financial planning.
(I'll brag a bit here..)
 
Service to you is one of our prime objectives. If it meant we
printed the darned thing on newsprint to get it out, we'd probably
do it that way, as we have to get on a regular schedule and stay
that way. But I'm hoping that the changes in production and
procedures will make that unecessary. I like being able to do things
like the Winter cover, and to keep TI looking as professional as
we'd like to be.
 
If you have further questions or comments, please let me know.
 
I remain, in service to our Society,

The second, on the much abused topic of a name for this Net.

                George.

This could give rise to a great many conversations, especially as heard
by an outsider: "Been on George lately," "Get anything from George yet?"
The optimum would, of course, be a neuter name. I don't wish to be
accused of sexism without due cause.

Subject: Thrusting Weapons in the List

I claim to be the Last Sword of the East, having won maybe 4 bouts in 11 years
of fighting, but I *have* been doing it for 11 years, and I remember when
fighting was a re-creation of an aspect of medieval culture, not the
jock-sport it is today. Now, I recall reading somewhere that in the sort of
combat we re-create (i.e. medieval combat-practice on foot) thrusting, or
"foining" as I believe it was called [Danulf?] was not allowed. So thrusting
tips on SCA weapons are unchivalrous and inauthentic, except in wars and
(perhaps) melee-lists. We should not thrust in single-combat situations.

Could anyone confirm or refute this?

The latest issue of TI has an announcement from the BoD regarding the revision
of Corpora. I urge everyone to read it, and to send in for a copy of the
draft, and to comment upon it, both to the BoD and to the Net.
The SCA is not a democracy. This is probably the closest thing to a vote on
the way we think the club should work, that we'll get in the next ten years.
Don't waste the chance. The BoD has asked *YOU* for *YOUR* opinions. If you
don't take the opportunity now, don't complain about the results later.
The above also goes for Laurel's request for comment on several heraldic
issues, and for the Marshall's proposed revision of the Rules of the Lists.

The Greeks had a word for someone who didn't vote. The word was "idiot".

The preceding was an unsolicited, unpaid political message, brought to you by
Caer Adenarian, a division of the incipient House Lucerna.

Subject: Non-European Personae

My compliments to Elizabeth Braidwood on her discussion of non-European
personae. Yes, I have the same reactions. Japanese personae don't bother me
although they should, and I didn't know why not. Of course, it's because
they've always been here, so I'm used to them.
On the other hand....
One thing that I think is always missed in these discussions is that
non-Europeans are supposed to be *visitors*. This club is about the Western
European Middle Ages. That means France, not Japan. That means 1349, not 350
BC. Or 1660 AD. That means Welshmen, not Cherokees. Now, I grant you that when
it was 1349 in Wales it was 1349 in (what is now) South Dakota, but American
Indians just don't fit into the game we're supposed to be playing. The reason
is hard to define, but (like pornography and jazz) we can't define it but we
can always recognize it when it's there. Cherokees don't fit. You know it and
I know and the Cherokees know it.
Here is the often-missed point about visitors. When non-standard personas
appear in the SCA, they appear as if they were home, in their "native" garb,
with native modes of behavior, etc. In period, this wouldn't have happened. To
take a just-slightly-out-of-period example, consider Pocahontas. Here we have
an American Indian marrying an Englishmen and going to England with him --
just the sort of thing you'd find in the sort of tortuously improbable persona
stories many of us favor. But what happened in this real-world case. Did
Pocahontas visit the Elizabethan court in her buckskins and moccasins, eating
pemmican off-board at the feast, and leading toast to Gitchee-Manitou? Hardly.
When she married John Rolfe, she converted to Christianity, took a Christian
name (Elizabeth, if memory serves), and wore proper Elizabethan clothing.
That's how non-Europeans are *supposed* to run their personae, but they never
do.
Now, I grant you, I think it's excessive to limit personae strictly to Western
Europe, but as it stands now, just about any persona is tolerated -- even
Ting-nye-seng-ge McPhee (a Tibetan Scot, if you can believe that!). In
Atenveldt & vicinity, there are (or have been) old-kingdom Egyptians, Aztecs,
and what-have-you. The Tuchux are -- what *are* the Tuchux, anyway --
CroMagnons, I suppose (no, that was *not* derogatory). There has to be a line
somewhere.
And not just spatially. We need a temporal line too, and we don't really have
one, especially on the early end. On the late end, well, a lot of Cavaliers
tend to push the limits. And the problem is that if we drawa line at Bosworth,
someone wants to be Elizabethan. If we draw it at Elizabeth, we get Cavaliers.
If we were to draw it at Cromwell, we'd get American Revolution and
Napoleonics, and Civil War. No matter where we draw the lines, someone is
going to want to push them. Even when we draw the lines at the very borders of
reality, someone wants to push them into fantasy (Middle Earth, Darkover,
Pern, Gor).
I think the SCA is far too tolerant, and the result is that no two people can
agree on just what the SCA *is*. The only point on which you will find
near-universal agreement is that the Articles of Incorporation ("pre-17th
century Western European culture") are a joke. *Nobody* believes them.

	I suspect that part of the problem is that, to most of us when
we started, the Japanese culture and dress were just as exotic as the 
European medieval cultures we we're just seeing, and so didn't 'jar' 
our perceptions as much as, say, an American Indian would.  We are used
(at least those of us in North America are) to seeing Amerind costume, so
seeing someone in it at an event is almost as jaring as seeing someone
in street clothes.  

	But there were period contacts with those cultures, and occationally 
they would appear in thier own garb (I seem to recall some references to 
American Indians visiting Europe and thier clothing (and sometimes lack thereof)
causing something of a stir.  So as *visitors* I have no problem with any of
them, and applaud some of the better done ones, such as the gentle who has been
at the last two Pennsics in armor compleately covered from helm to toe in
leopard skin, carrying a nicely done replica of an Aztec obsidion broadsword
that was a legal weapon.

[Comments about how visitors should be wearing period european garb.]

	But the example you give is of someone who entered european culture,
not of a visitor.  While I can see visitors wearing european garb at times,
I think that there would also be times when they would wear thier own cultural
garb, and the events we stage at tourneys and most feasts would be just such
a time.

Well, that explains the strange noises coming from the bathroom, anyway.

I just got a Yamaha soprano to replace a fondly remembered AULOS, and
find it nearly as good, and less expensive (c. $5 vs. $12-$15).  I would
have gotten another Aulos, but all the music stores I went to didn't
stock that line anymore.

I'm sure that a specialty shop would carry it, but five years ago, *all*
the music stores had the Aulos line.  Now they all have Yamaha.  Hmmm...

Subject: Reply to: More Hardwood Spearshafts

Master Kobayashi, I must say that grumpy or not, your contributions
to this discussion have been relevant and calm.  I had hesitated
several months ago to bring up this very topic, as everyone seems to
have different opinions on armor and weapons standards, and I feared
to provoke a barrage of messages generating more heat than light.  It
seems I have underestimated the Rialto.   I may disagree with some of
your opinions, but I do want to hear them and get a more balanced 
perspective on the weapons differences across kingdoms.  I believe this
issue to be quite alive and kicking, especially considering the rumored 
rule changes that may be happening in the East.  I think that the East 
currently has a balance between the armor, weapons, and rules, and if
one changes, the others may need to change as well to restore balance. 
For the record, I'm not in favor of anything that requires fighters to
do too much thinking on the battlefield.  It has been proven to my
satisfaction that cluttering up the brains of the stickjacques (and
stickjacquelines :-)) is a good way to lose the war.  

:Can we kneel on the haybales?
:Yes, but you can't put your foot up on it, and you can't
 sit on it.  You can rest your weapon on it, or maybe your elbow if
 you're on your knees, but if you put your head down on it or put any
part of your body (not including weapons) past the vertical plane at the
outermost edge of the haybale then you're dead.  At least in this
battle.  In the next battle, if you do so much as breathe on the
haybales you're dead.  Understand? 

:Uh, I'll go to the back of the group.

Danulf Donaldson mentioned recently that the secret society was maybe too

all I've heard so far is discussion on the name symbols and password.  I
really like the 'Fishmonger' idea.  A contraction of fishwife and gossip-
monger perhaps?  Sounds appropriate.

By the way, in case any of you don't know, Canada is that place way up

Subject: recipes and tips for herbed wine

There are several basic rules to consider when making an herbed wine.  

Firstly, you should be sure to use herbs that are relatively fresh, so that 
they will have a good proportion of volatile oils still in them.  This 
generally means that Durkee and McCormick are right out.  Try going to your 
local food coop or herbalist--and use a good sniff test.  

Secondly, choose sweet herbs, such as the mint family, or anise.  Do not try
to make saged wine--it sounds dignified but will taste truly foul.  Mildly
bitter herbs may be used (caraway or cumin for example) but be advised that if
you don't like Chartreuse or Campari, you won't like the product of these
herbs in alcohol. 

Thirdly, use citrus with the herbs.  Citrus peel, in small quantities, will 
not be overpowering to the wine, but will modify the bitter tendencies of many 
herbs.  Ginger (minced candied works well) will also clarify a muddy taste, 
and can be added to "salvage" a batch that just doesn't work.

Lastly, be aware that in alcohol, you are extracting the medicinal extract of 
the herbs, and if you drink half a bottle of herbed wine, you are taking a 
medicinal dose of that herb.  Find a reliable herbal (I recommend 
_The_Herb_Book_ by John Lust, available in paperback) and look up the herbs 
before you use them.  Some things you wouldn't expect have highly potent 
medicinal uses--there is hardly any licorice used in licorice candy anymore 
because of this.

I would personally recommend woodruff and damiana for spring wines; anise, a
touch of mint, and lemon peel for winter wines.

Subject:      Fiberglass spears


To the Gentles of the Net, Greetings.

I assembled the 40 odd spears that Myrkfaellen took to the war.  The
shafts were purchased by Master John the Pell, and left with me when he
left for the Pensic War.  I delivered the spears on the Thursday before
the battles.  Most of the spears were then distributed by Master John
the Pell, encluding 10 shafts without spear heads.

That evening, Master John and the marshalls tested the spears I had
assembled.  The spears stood up to normal (ab)use.  One of the spears
was "tested" to destuction.  It failed when two people sat on it and
the spear was used as a lever to lift them.  The shaft failed when it
was bent beyond 90 degrees.  The break was ragged with flexable pointed
splinters up to 6 inches long, some still connecting the two parts.
The broken ends were definitly dangerous.  The break happend 3 feet
from the spear head.

The spears I assembled had black shafts.  The thickness of the walls
varied considerably because the central hole was off center.

Sir Master Gryphon's spear shaft was grey.  The walls of the shaft were
of a more uniform thickness.  The spear seemed stiffer than the ones
with the black shafts.  Sir Master Gryphon ordered his single spear
shaft from a different company than Master John.

Master John said that the color was an option and that grey was one
of the other two choices he had.

Greetings to all!

One varient of Hypocrys (spiced wine sweetened with honey, as opposed to wine 
sweetened with sugar, which is clary) that is fun and interesting is this one 
discovered (in the Menagier de Paris, i think) by Keturah:  Take your 
wine and devide it in four parts and sweeten one with honey and into another 
put peppercorns tied in a cloth and in a third put sticks of cinnemon and into 
the fourth put ginger (the MP would have used ginger preserved in sugar, but 
fresh works fine, just don't try it with powderd ginger) and when each is of 
the strength desired  take out the spice and bottle separately and then you 
can mix your hypocrys as you like it (honey and pepper is interesting)...

Those of you who have worked with "Pleyn Delite" will be saddened to hear that 
Sharon Butler has died...
Constance Hieatt has a new book "An Ordinance of Pottage"  which is a 
transcription of a 15th C. ms at Yale University.   It has several totally new 
receipes and sheds light on many of those in the Harlein MS's.  Those of you 
who have experience reconstructing recipies should take care with the 
addaptations given in the back of the book--Some of the changes are 
justifiable on the basis of research which she doesn't bother to 
enumerate, others merely make the dishes more acceptable to modern cooks and 
eaters.  The foot noting and glosses are all that we have learned to expect... 
really top-notch scollrship and a very usefull new body of work...Its come out 
in England, but hasn't hit B.I.P. yet, Keep an eye out for it

Yamaha has come out with a new plastic alto an tenor recorder and they are 
REALLY GOOD!  Excellent tone throughout the entire range, very responsive.  
Also (i think) very light weight (but then, I'm used to blackwood...). There 
not exactly cheep, but you'd have to pay 10 X the price to get a comparable 
quality in a wooden recorder, and I can play it in the shower (that for stuffy 
purists) They also have a soprano and sopranino with which i am less enamored, 
but that may be because i'm not used to the smaller instruments.

Happy tacky tinsle time!

	That's not the progression that I've always heard.  The use of
firearms made effective battlefield armor too heavy to be usefull, and the
resulting abandonment of armor by the combatants led to the use of the lighter
faster weapon, and the passing of the sword from a badge of the military to
the rapier and its like as the badge of the gentry.  I have even seen the 
opinion expressed (in 19th Century fencing manuals) that the rise of the
firearm and the decline of armor were required steps before the 'art' of 
fence could really evolve.

	An interesting but out-of-period historical note is that armor was
still slightly popular as late as the American Civil War, where bullet proof
breastplates and such did save a few lives, though most thought them too heavy
and restrictive to be practical.

Subject: House Phoenix Mulled Wine

With all the talk of mulled wine...  The following is a recipe that has
been a favorite among the folk of the House of the Golden Phoenix for
several yule seasons now. (And many non-yule seasons too. :-)  ) It's good
very warm (almost hot), lukewarm (you turned the stove off a while ago),
cold (oops, left out overnight) and with ice (in the fridge.) It has the
added bonuses of being very easy to make, relatively cheap and attractive
to the mundane tastebuds we all posess.

House Phoenix Mulled Wine

Pour in a large pot:
Equal parts of the cheapest red wine you can find and cranberry cocktail
or juice.
Add:	a cinnamon stick
	15 whole cardemom seeds
	10 whole cloves
	a large orange, sliced
	sugar to taste (1/4 to 1 cup, depending on if you're using
cranberry juice, which is rather tart, or cranberry cocktail, which is
already sweetened.)

Heat slowly, savouring the smell and sampling often. Does wonders for colds
and is excellent on a cold winter night.

Seasons Greetings to all.

Subject: More Hardwood Spearshafts

OK, so maybe i was feeling a little grumpy last time.

One of the ironic things that i find is that there is now some controversy
over the difference between "poltruded" fiberglass and whatever the other
kinds are.  I may be mis-remembering (i do that a lot), but i seem to
recall someone suggesting that, to tell the difference, one should take
the spear in question out to the parking lot and bang it on the pavement
a couple of times.  If it doesn't break, then it's the good kind.

This same test will distinguish a hardwood shaft from a softwood shaft, and
will even detect many cross-grained hardwood shafts.  I dare say that the
pseudo-hardwood spearshaft mentioned in one of the replies would have failed
spectacularly under this test, and it requires no knowlege of wood to
administer.  :-)  I must admit that i don't like the thought of my favorite
spear being banged about before every tourney, but the concern for safety
is legitimate and i would allow it if it meant that i could then use the
spear.

I will speak no more on this, which is essentially a dead issue.

Subject:  Diversity; potables; confusion

Greetings!

Whereas I disagree with William de Corbie regarding diversity _per se_, I
agree with his idea of theme or "defined" events.  A number of such have been
held in Trimaris with a great deal of success.  However, I must counsel
caution in implementing such ideas.  When the event allows people to use their
usual garb (in case they don't own any British Tudor, or whatever), and is
otherwise not too stringent in approach, all generally goes well.  But when
one _must_ conform in dress and manner (and everything else) to the specified
time and culture, there's generally trouble.  I myself once decided not to go
to an event of the latter ilk:  not only did I not have proper garb and such,
but the autocrat was planning to fine people who lapsed somehow from the
desired milieu (the fines were in fake funds provided for the event, if I
remember).  To me, it was a bit too much.

Another, related comment:  group camping is mucho fun, and when a group effort
is made as to personae the resuts can be utterly spectacular!

To Nicolette Bonhomme and Arval:  I sent you each some suggestions for your
potables.   Please contact me if the message failed to reach you.

Last:  is there anyone out there from Albany, NY, who tried to reach me
direct?  I was editing a file, and _something_ from Albany flashed across my
screen as I was typing which ended in "How's the weather?"  Since I'm a pretty
fast typist, part of it was obscured by the cursor as it moved.  And, there
was no new e-mail for me.  So I've *no* idea what that was all about!  If
someone can enlighten me, please do!

M'lord Phillip, I am a bit surprised that you had never seen that
twist upon the knighting ceremony before.

I first saw it done by Talymar the last time he was King.  He
did it that way quite frequently, but I do not remember if he
did it that way all the time.  In fact I remember it being used at
a knighting ceremony which I know you attended.

I am thinking of the knighting of (now) Baron Sir David de Kunstanar.

I too like this twist on the knighting ceremony.

     I have to disagree with Kobayashi, if no one ever does he will probably get
elected
to some office he doesn't want. Firstly I disagree with his idea of why the
spears were
outlawed, and secondly with his spelling of the word "valiant". Actually, I am
flamingly
in agreement with his opinions about spear safety.
     Kobayashi taught me how to inspect for hard or soft wood shafts. It was
much easier
than inspecting maces for metal in the heads. Then there was the polearm I found
at the
war that was padded with NEWSPAPER. My spear is a little lighter than
Kobayashi's, and
I have some trouble getting blows accepted, but thats ok. I wouldn't mind
getting hit in the
face with it as much as with some legal blows. Lighter is safer. Rattan is heavy
or inaccurate.
(N. S. story warning)
     About 8 years ago, when I was very new and learning to fight, (actually
learning to lose)
I got a legal blow I won't forget. I was using sword and round shield, and
hadn't really learned
to dodge or move well, when my opponent got me. He rushed close past my right
side while
swinging a bastard sword into my face. (with excellent form) (by the way did you
know
that the average SCA sword weighs twice as much as a real one, it's in the T.I.)

Unto Lord Arval Benicour, Brigantia Herald, and to the members of the "net"
GREETINGS!

Re: the idea of sending internal letters of intent (ILOI's) on the net - a
loud raspberry!

One major problem - how to do emblazons?

Comments via email are a possibility, though I won't do it due to
logistics.  I look forward to future comments on the experiment.

Friedrich, Sycamore


Additional Greetings from Lady Orianna, Seedling Pursuivant

I heartily agree with my Lord and even heartily disagree with the notion of
ILOI's and comments on the net.  Considering the volume of regular mail we
get as commenters on letters of intent, the volume of email is staggering.
In our "location", mail from the net is not directly delivered to me, but
is forwarded by another gentle.  Any comments are sent from me to the other
gentle and he forwards them to the net.  Since both of us are at work and
have full work loads, this could conceivably become overwhelming, to us and
to our internal network.  Please, rethink this idea before it goes much
further.

I do thank Arval for his list of EK heralds and their net addresses.  This
gives us the opportunity to communicate as necessary.  

For those gentles who have been adding "drawings" to your messages, thank
you but I haven't the vaguest idea what the collection of lines means.  My
system doesn't translate that stuff very well (which is why emblazons
wouldn't work).

Thank you for your time.

Orianna

The carolingian cooks guild looked up 'huzza' and 'hurrah' in the OED and 
found that the former was first doccumented in Engilsh (not *used*, 
*documented*) in the late 16th century, and 'hurrah' shows up just over the 
line in the 17th Century... We were unable to discover where the 'hip, hip' 
came in... any one else??   I rather like 'huzza' (var. 'hussa' !?!) myself, 
it sounds cheerfull, aproving, and enthousiastic, although not particularly 
courtly.  Perfect for English personae fencers, who are likely to be 
elizabethan anyway. (oops, i mean elizabethan persona fencers, who are likely 
to be english)  Are the watchers allowed to shout during tourneys?  How about 
after someone wins?
A scroll-making friend says of the chorused "oo, aah, ohh,"  "You think it's 
cute until they do it to one of *your* scrolls, and then you want to throttle 
them."  I see her point.  While an involuntary gasp of admiration is very 
flattering, it often seems that people are having more fun ooing and aaing 
than they are acctually expressing appreciation.  At a kingdom event i cant 
even **see** the scroll when its held up.  Any calligraphers out there care ti 
comment??
I find it interesting that in the East, while we dutifully chant, vivat, vivat 
,vivat after the herald, if we *mean* it we then break out into miscelllanious 
crys, cheers, applause, whistling, and stamping of feet.  I susspect that 
"amen" (do you shout it, or just speak from your diaphram) whould not satisfy 
my basic urge to *approve* (it so *subjunctive*) ("amen, sister" ???  How about
 "soit" which is in a language that i understand??)

THe new yorker magazine once listed in their section "shouts we doubt ever got 
shouted," "Long live king Edward! What a fine, lusty young man he is!" Quoted 
from some historical article or other.  How *does* one find out what people 
shouted?

Subject: Personas & recreation
Message-ID: <881218021938.14.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

Milords and ladies.

I belong to those who believe that we already have quite enough diversity
within the SCA. To make the dream come true, to create the illusion of
actually being there, in the Middle Ages, we certainly don't need a lot
of African tribesmen, Chinese mandarins or Indian Ghurkas. It's difficult
enough to conjure up such an illusion with Vikings and Tudors present at
the same place. If anything, I would prefer a movement in the other direc-
tion, i.e. to concentrate ourselves on western Europe.

This, however, is merely my personal preference, and I don't intend to
embark on a campaign to oust all samurai from the Society (Ninjas are
a different thing, I would like to oust them totally and permanently!).

It was interesting to read milord Kwellend Njal's account of the event
where people were camped together with similar personas. This brings me
to the main issue here: How can we give as many people as possible the
chance to re-create the particular part of the Middle Ages they like,
and be what they want to be, while at the same time creating a credible
illusion, re-creation or whatever we call it so that the Dream may become
Reality for some precious moments?

I believe that the key lies in doing things *together*. The SCA is far
too much a collection of strong-willed individuals, fiercely independent.
It is far too little a group of people who work together towards a common
goal.

We have a persona system which is brilliantly conceived: by choosing to
be an imaginary medieval person, we are prodded to learn about that person
and his/her time and place. Very educational. And so we sew a costume, make
armor and get period feast gear etcetera, and invent a name and a life story
for our persona. And when all is ready we go to the Event and try to act out
the persons we are. This is very nice, but it's not enough if we want to see
the Dream come true. An event consisting of some people who are doing their
best to *be* their personas will never become more than a weird collection
of assorted individuals.

What we need is events with a theme, events where one particular time
and place is depicted. Let's say that we decide to make a Norman feast.
The local Normans naturally want to do the arrangements, cook the food
and decorate the hall. It's their chance to show off everything they
know about Norman culture. When the feast is started, all those who are
not Normans will kindly pretend to be Normans, just for tonight. Never
mind that you are dressed in your usual Tudor/Viking/Moose/Whatever costume,
you act with the theme of the feast and try to be as Norman as you can.
Or if you are ignorant of Norman things, you draw back and watch.

To get the right feeling, theatrical things should be done at the feast.
Those who arranged it can act out small scenes which bring out something
typical for their culture. I can think of a dozen Norman things to do,
right now. Thus, you can all be in 12th century Normandy for one night.
Next time, you're somewhere else.

The trick is to forget about the SCA. You are *not* at an SCA revel!
You are in Shrewsbury, A.D. 1315 or in Paris, A.D. 1472, or wherever.
The SCA doesn't exist. And suddenly, you are *there*. It should be part
of SCA policy that the SCA does not exist outside of Court.

Perhaps all of this is impossible, due to the system we have. We don't
live in France, but in Caid or Atenveldt or wherever. The SCA cannot be
avoided. But we should try to work towards depucting medieval *society*,
not just a bunch of medieval *persons*.

Comments are warmly invited, and a Merry Christmas is wished on you all by

Excellent point, my lady.  Severl years back, the formulaic Oooh!
Aaah! got to be so prevalent in the East that Master Johannes aus
Neirenstein, then Tyger Clerk of the Signet, waged a personal campaign
to point out to people that it had become an insult, not a praise.
His point was simple: If you think a piece of work is praiseworthy,
then praise it, but don't make a travesty of the work and the
ceremony.  Alas, this unpleasant custom is on the rise once again.

Nicolette Bonhomme sends all good greetings unto
the FisherFolk -

     I have been listening to the net for some time, and wish to reply
to several topics raised as well as bring up some new questions.

     Firstly, let me introduce myself.  My name is Nicolette Bonhomme,
a Frank.  On one hand I believe I live in a blessed world, as
the millenium has recently come and gone, and the world was not destroyed as
was predicted by so many.  On the other hand, my lord is long since left
to do battle in the Holy Land with a red cloth cross pinned to his tunic,
so I have been left on my own to defend and maintain our home.  Thus, since
there is a dearth of male family members but an overabundance of greedy
neighbors, I have been forced to consider learning to defend our holdings
by the sword.

     Old business first, then new.  For those FisherFolk looking for advice,
sources, and experienced help with period knitting, please address your
questions to       Lady Elaigne Kerr
                   c/o Eileen McCabe

     Her work is scrupulous and her research is excellent ( ***shameless
plug from her housemate*** ).

     On the secret society: Huzzah! for Master Kobayashi's idea.

     On brewing: a question for mead brewers on the net.  What spice
combinations do you use?  Have you had any luck (or ever seen the necessity
for) yeast nutrient?  My latest gallon is a bit sour, and it was my first
gallon made with yeast nutrient.

    On cooking: does anyone have a more specific recipe for waybread than
is listed in the Knowne World Handbook?  That recipe seemed rather vague,
but the results sound delicious.  For that matter, what foods do people
especially like to cook when at a camping event?

     On heavy list: I am begining what I hope will be many years of
energetic and capable fighting, but I have a LOT to learn. So, for those
on the net who engage in heavy list, could you offer me some good advice?
In other words, "If I could offer one piece of advice to someone starting
heavy list it would be..."

     Also, thank you for the wonderful discussions about the calendar and
its evolution.  I am a Leap Year baby, and enjoyed learning more in-depth
about where my birthing day comes from.

     In service to the barony,

 (I still haven't figured out how to add things I've read in other postings, so
 please bear with me.) 
   The practice described in the letter I'm responding to has been used for
every Knighting I've attended in the Outlands since we became a Kingdom, with
 one exception. After standing a vigil, the Knights of the realm are called up
 before the crown, in order of precedance. The candidate is then called to join
them, and is asked if, after hearing the counsel of the populace, he still feels
 he is worthy of the impending honor. If such is the case, a representative of 
 the Laurel is called forth to attest to the candidates' efforts in the areas 
 of the arts and sciences. A Pelican is then calleforth to attest to the service
 
the candidate has rendered to the kingdom. The ceremony then continues from 
there. The same is the case for the other peerages, in that representatives of 
the other two peerages are always asked to attest to the fact that the future
peer has excelled not only in their narrow field of expertice, but also in the 
other aspects of SCA life. The response is usually in the following form:
 'Your Majesties. After taking counsel with the other members of the esteemed
 Order of XXXXXXX, I can attest form their words and from my own certain
 knowledge, that (candidates name) has acquired knowledge in the field of XXXX
 as befits a Nobleman(woman) of this realm, and we, The Companions of the XXXX
 feel that this person is worthy of the honor bestowed today.'

Subject: Spiced Wine
Message-Id: <Dec.19.18.20.05.1988.6229@butterfly.rutgers.edu>


Greetings to all!

As Twelfth Night grows nearer, I am planning to prepare several
gallons of spiced wine.  I need some advise.  In the past, I have made
a sweet spiced wine which has gotten good reviews drunk both hot &
old.  This year, I also plan to try an herbed wine, and I'd like
suggestions on what might work well.

My recipe is something like:

Use a cheap red wine.  Gallo Hearty Burgundy works just fine.

Make a syrup of sugar (about a half cup per 1/2 gal of wine)
                a cup or two of water
                the juice of several lemons, and limes and/or oranges
                the peels & meat of the same, chopped finely
                one or two sticks of cinnamon
                12 to 20 cloves
                a couple teaspoons of nutmeg
                chopped ginger
		
Mix it into the wine & heat on very low flame while stirring until it
just begins to simmer.  Pour the whole mess into bottles, seal them,
and let them sit as long as possible before drinking.  All ingredients
can be varied to taste, but too much sugar will give you too cloying a
mixture.  The lemon juice makes the wine nicely refreshing, and the
ground fruit gives it tang.  If the wine sits for a couple weeks, the
sediment can be re-used to re-spice another batch of wine.

This year, as I said, I am planning to try an herbed wine, and I am
not quite sure what to use.  I figure to use less sugar (but still
some), a less acidic wine, and to use lemon & rosemary.  I would be
pleased if anyone could suggest other herbs which will work.  I am
also considering trying this mixture on a fairly dry white wine.  What
do you think?

	Arval.

Yup, I saw her, too.  Do you know that she is SCAfolk, my lady?  I
didn't see the whole thing, but in the part I saw, she carefully
avoided identifying the organization she belongs to, and there is an
SCA-like group in New Hapshire called "the Game".  She did say she is

Well, the story goes something like this...

Back in the early days of the tenure of Master Wilhelm von Schlussel
as Laurel King of Arms, AS 14 or so, there was a huge backlog of
submissions to be dealt with by his office.  So, Master Wilhelm
convened a meeting of the heralds of the Knowne World in order to get
the work done in a marathon session.  Long about the third day, the
heap of folders had dwindled to an insignificant size, and everyone
was feeling pretty punchy.  

About the same time (as years go), Master Baldwin of Erebor, then Aten
Principal Herald (head herald of Atenveldt), had written this very
funny heraldic song, which he had been playing where people could hear
it!  The chorus, for those of you who haven't heard it, is:

I've got a dove displayed upon a billet chequy Or and gules
Between a pair of cockatrices, clad in motley, like a fool's;
Their feathers are dimidiated 
With a tree eradicated
Limbed and fructed counter-compony!

and the verses are just as good.  

Back to the meeting.  Now, Baldwin hadn't been able to make it to the
Great Conclave, as this meeting was called, and after several hundred
submissions, it was generally agreed that something must be done to
avenge the assembled heralds on Baldwin.  As it happens, Baldwin's own
arms had been submitted & rejected about that time, so they decided to
treat this song as a resubmission.  Of course, this took some thought,
since the blazon given seemed woefully incomplete.  However, through
creative use of default colorations & positions (the dove is white,
right?  And cockatrices are green where they are snaky, and
chicken-colored where they are chickens.  Motley is lozengy gules and
Or, and...  And so on), they managed to figure out what the picture
must look like.  So they drew it.  The field, by the way, was
obviously Argent.  After all, what did any herald say when he saw this
thing?  "ARG!  A dove displayed..."  Then, they registred it to
Baldwin as a badge.

The next time Atenveoldt had no submissions passed on a Letter of
Acceptances and Returns, Wilhelm tucked this gem in.  Reliable rumor
has it that Baldwin opened the letter, said something like "Huh?  We
don't have any submissions this month!"  And then spent the next hour
rolling on the floor in hysterical laughter.

Subject:  More about group persone; diversity

Greetings!

I would thank Henry of Maldon for clarifying his views on group personae.
From the tone of his most recent posting, I get the impression that what Henry
was actually thinking of was more along the lines of a household (or something
similar) all of whose members are interested in the same type of persona.
This I have no problem with; in fact, I think it's a good idea.  What I have a
problem with (and have in fact encountered to some degree once or twice) is an
entire corporate entity (shire, canton, whatever) group persona.  This, I
think, would be stifling.

Anyway, it seems to me that part of this whole discussion was triggered by
semantics, and nothing more.

As to diversity and diversification:  one of the things we tend to get in our
schooling is a mindset of "Middle Ages = Western Europe and the Near East."
Well, there were lots of interesting things going on elsewhere in the world at
the same time.  For instance:  how many people are aware that the great
African civilizations peaked during this era?  What about South America?
That's why I hold the view of allowing personae from any culture that existed
_during our stated time frame._  The Medieval Era was an awful lot of places.

I can understand the feelings of those who find the sight of all these
different personae in one place jarring.  For that matter, the average
English, French, and Spanish citizens (to name a few) didn't encounter
foreigners of *any* sort.  A case could be made that _any_ mixture is jarring.
On the other hand, Native Americans were brought back to Europe from the
earliest contacts with the New World as living exhibits-- so a case could be
made with things like this as a starting point for diversity.

Speaking for myself:  the most important reasons we're all here are to interact
with and learn from one another in a unique manner and environment, as we
pursue our elusive Dream (and have lotsa fun, too!).  Diversity will in my
view enhance this.

Happy holidays to all!

                                In Service,

                                     Cher de Bellevue

Subject: Knights and stick jocks    

This weekend, I attended the annual Barony of the Flame
(Louisville, KY) Christmas Tourney. There was a knighting, which
was the first that I had seen performed by our latest king, Sir
Reynard the Brown. When he put the candidate on vigil, he said that
the candidate was to bring with him an member from each of the
Order of the Rose, the Order of the Laurel, and the Order of the
Pelican.

At the actual knighting ceremony, each of the various members of
the Orders were called upon in turn to attest to the fitness of the
candidate. The lady of the Rose attested to his chivalry, the
Laurel to his skill in the arts and/or sciences, and the Pelican to
his service.

To me, this is a new thing. I can see where it is not at all bad,
since it gets out of the 'Knight = hyper-active stick jock' mode of
thinking, and can promote more activity by fighters in non-fighting
activity. But on the other hand, does this mean that knights will
be coming up during Laurel ceremonies? I kind of doubt it.

Just a thought thrown out to the whim of the Rialto.

Several years ago, a good SCA friend of mine got married. His lady
wife-to-be was also SCA-folk, but the parents were *very* mundane. (I
know, I know.) Specifically, the parents of the bride, who were paying
for the wedding, were in the upper class of Detroit, and in fact the
wedding was to be held at a very exclusive country club.

Anyway, they invited their SCA friends to come, in garb. A number of us
did, and thereupon engaged in the most extreme case of "freak the
locals" that I have ever seen. The bride prevailed upon the maid of
honor to wear something SCAish, and she showed up in a fairy-tale
princess outfit, complete with a 2 foot pointy hat. But, the parents
and the majority of the guests, were in tuxedo-type formal wear.

Onward to the wedding dinner. All the folk that had showed up in garb
were seated in the "dining room of honor" (a smaller dining room to one
side), much to the dismay of a number of other guests. And, to top it
off, the toast to the bride and groom was offered by one of the SCA
folk. In fact, it was with much amusement on our part that we listened
to the maitre'd announce, in a thick French accent, that the toast was
to be given by, "Korak Starbearer, ka-Kahn of the Dark Horde."

Now, let's talk about people not knowing what to do for a toast.

        Proposed changes to Rules of the List
        EE-Wah-Nee-Wah!!!
        Oak spearshafts.

Date: Sat, 17 Dec 88 00:50 EDT
From: "DENNIS R. SHERMAN//ROBYYAN TORR D'ELANDRIS" <DRS%UNCVX1.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU>
Subject: Proposed changes to Rules of the List

Has anyone else noticed that the proposed revision to the Rules of the
List says nothing about fighting for someone in Crown Tourney?  The
current Rules are specific and detailed (and clumsily non-sexist) about
having a consort, while the proposed revision says nothing about it.
Anyone know if this is covered somewhere else? (Corpora?)

The current Rules of the List have some very specific verbiage about
weapons - barring them (rule 9), mutual acceptability (rule 10), appeal
of barring (rule 11), and rejecting an opponent's weapon (rule 12).  The
proposed rules are missing a lot of this, and in fact, seem to reverse
some of it.  Specifically, the rule that concerns me is:

  7.  No one may be required to participate in Combat-Related
  Activities.  Any combatant may, without dishonor or penalty,
  reject any challenge without specifying a reason.  A fight in a
  Tournament Lists is not to be considered a challenge, and may not
  be summarily declined or rejected.

This proposed rule seems to be the replacement for the current rule 12,
  Any combatant may without dishonor or penalty reject any challenge,
  or the use of a particular weapon by his or her opponent, should he or
  she deem the weapon unusually dangerous.

My concern here is that according to my reading of the proposed rule, if
my opponent is planning to use a weapon that I think is dangerous, I
have only the options of participating in a bout that I think is unsafe,
or of yielding the bout.  The current rule, in combination with the
current rule 10,
  Any weapons mutually acceptable to the combatants in a fight may be
  used on the field of battle subject to the provisions of Rule 9
suggest to me that my opponent and I must come to some agreement about
the safety of weapons involved before the bout begins - i.e. if I think
his polearm is too heavy to be safe, we can resolve the situation by
finding another polearm for him to use.  Now, I expect that to be the
common solution to the problem, even if the proposed rules are adopted,
but what about the twit of a sword-jock that says "Uh, duh, I like my
8 pound polearm, 'cause I can hit real hard with it" and won't switch?
(I know, this is an exaggerated case, and there are several other ways
to bounce either the weapon [bar via rule 5] or the fighter [via rule 4])
I'd like something in the rules that says weapons should be acceptable
to both fighters.

Another item is barred weapons - the current rules outline a procedure
for appealing to the Sovereign and a Court of Chivalry when a weapon is
barred.  The proposed rules stop at the Sovereign.  I doubt very much
that I will ever be in the position of having a weapon barred that I
think is safe, but I'd like an appeal procedure just in case.  It is
already there in the current rules, why take it out?

But, while talking about taking things out, I'm glad to see that the
proposed rules do not contain copies of current rules 12-16, I expect
because they are all covered in proposed rule 4 or 6.  (Yup, referring
to numbers only is on purpose - I want folks to hunt up a copy and
look at the things)

And, one last thought, the last rule talks about projectile and thrown
weapons - stating they are forbidden in tournament, but may be acceptable
for melee or war.  (Side issue: when is war different from melee?)
What about a 3 or 5 person team tourney?  Its melee, but also tournament.
Should there be a flat ban of projectile and thrown weapons from all
tourney lists, or should the rule be relaxed a little to permit it if the
conditions for that tourney are made known to all participants ahead of
time?  For example, here in Atlantia, I am told (I'm a recent import from
the Middle, and haven't seen all this yet) that javelins are useable by
any heavy fighter, and that there have been "rocks" used as projectile
weapons.  I can imagine a "barbarian" tourney, where there are piles of
the sca-legal "rocks" on the tourney field, available for throwing at your
opponent if the occasion arises.  Note that I haven't ever heard of this
happening, I'm just making it up.  It might be fun, but as the rules are
currently proposed, we can't do it.  I'm in favor of rules for safety,
but lets not cut out more than we have to.

Agreeing, dissenting, and other opinions are welcome.  The BoD has asked
for our input, the least we can do is give it to them...

Subject:  EE-Wah-Nee-Wah!!!

Lord Arval (and everybody else),

        You have slandered the good name of...um...uhhh...well somebody!!!
Seriously, Trollhaven is a canton, not of Barony Beyond the Mountain, but
of the Barony of the Bridge!  In fact they are the southernmost Canton of
that barony (URI in N. Kingston RI) - therefore they are "the trolls who
live under the bridge" ;-)   Furthermore the translation of EE-Wah-Nee-Wah
as I understand it is "We're havin' a b*tchin' good time now, huh?"

        The Barony Beyond the Mountain is not blameless in this however,
for . . . (And this is _my_ version of the story, much better than the
original) . . . It was at a feast in that fair Barony (Some say a Salomalah
feast, and I believe them) that it came to pass that the Trolls had been
drinking (as is their wont) and were ever so slightly intoxicated.  An hour
or so later they were heavily intoxicated.  And a few hours after that one fine
troll (who shall remain nameless, (which isn't to say he _was_ Nameless) seeing
as how their all such _big_ guys), said something which sounded suspiciously
like EE-Wah-Nee-Wahhh...thud (thud being the sound trolls make when they pass
out and fall under the table)  To which all the other trolls (having understood
the first troll's valiant effort to say "well, we're havin' a b*tchin' good
time now, huh?") agreed - with not much better success.

As an Earl Marshall for a kingdom with over 900 fighters and over 150
people on the marshallate mailing list I can say that this point of view
is not just held at the Corporate level.  If I could personally know each
of the over 100 Knight Marshalls or Knight Marshalls of the Field in the
Middle I would feel better about allowing weapons or armor that can fail in
disastrous ways, as oak shafts or, more importantly, pine shafts masquerading
as oak can fail (when a neo fighter I bought an "oak" shaft at a local
lumber yard and used it for some months before it broke into a real spear
and a short club.  As you can tell, I knew nothing about wood).   

I can also tell you that I hope to do a lot of traveling next year for the
purpose of helping to standardize weapons/armor inspection standards and
authorization standards.  We are beginning to use video for marshallate
training, especially for authorizations (what's wrong with this picture..).

     As I may be the person who started this discussion (but I'm not sure,
because none of the other postings have addressed what I actually said), I
would like to clarify my comments/suggestions of a few weeks ago.  I was
not saying that everyone in each local group would have to adopt the same
type of persona.  On the contrary, I suggested that group personae could
give people the opportunity to be honorary members of groups appropriate
to their own personae, while still being involved in their local group.
     My idea concerning group personae is that each group could adopt a
persona *without* requiring that everyone in the group follow suit (in
fact, I think that such a requirement should be expressly forbidden).
Anyone in a group's territory, regardless of persona, could still claim
(even in persona) to be a member of that group, but would also have the
option of claiming membership in another group persona, without losing
their right to be counted (in everything but persona) as a member of the
local group.  This way, those who would prefer to have an appropriate
place for their persona within the Known World would be able to find one,
and those who just don't care about this issue wouldn't really have to
worry about it.  By the way, this isn't really all that far from what
we're already doing, because many groups claim some sort of persona by
choosing a name which could only belong to a specific culture (although
others come up with names like Wasted Rustlands ;-), or even Wading Pigs
;-), some of which don't even sound like places at all).
     To answer one argument in advance, it seems to me that anyone who is
sufficiently concerned about persona purity to take advantage of this
system would be willing to become actively involved in the group in which
they claimed membership.  After all, almost everyone has some interest in
the period and region which they choose for their own persona.

     My agreeness!  Diversificate to the max!  The more the merriment!
Let's spread out to cover all time periods, including the present and the
future, and all ethnic groups, including space aliens and various other
monstrositaries!  Devil take the hind parts!  I want my first alternate
persona to be a slox (from Laumer's Retief books). ;-)
     Does this sound like an idea out of your worst nightmares?
     Seriously, I don't like to see too much variety in personae, because
it spoils the illusion of a Medieval society which I thought we were
trying to create.  I simply don't see the point in trying to pretend that
we're living in the Middle Ages when people from all over the world from
any time between 4000 BC and 1650 AD are mixed together indiscriminately
without so much as pretending to come from different places.  At a *real*
Medieval tournament/feast/whatever, you would not find anywhere near as
wide a variety of costumes, types of armor, and so on, as you can find at
almost any large SCA event.
     Besides, there is plenty of diversity to be found just within the
proper boundaries of the SCA (Western Europe, 400 to 1600 AD), to keep
persona-researchers busy for the next 500 years or so.  I suspect that
anyone who does not realize this has never done any serious historical
research.
     The argument quoted above is very simplistic.  There are an awful
lot of possibilities within the SCA period and region other than Celts
and Norsecritters.  For example, there are Romans (the Empire didn't fall
just because Rome was sacked), Spanish Moors, Eastern Romans/Byzantines,
and perhaps even Turks (if I recall correctly, they advanced as far as
Vienna).  You could even make a case in favor of Mongols, and the other
peoples who came with them (even including a few Chinese) in the 13th
century.  And then there are English, French, German, Italian, Spanish,
and various in-between peoples of many different eras.  If anything, we
already have too much diversity, even without bringing in the Japanese,
Indians, American Indians, and Central/Southern Africans.

Subject: Vivat and Amen


Peace and Long life unto all the Listeners in the Rialto from Mustapha
al-Muhaddith.  And afterwords.

I had been doing some reading in period Arabic fiction, and had found
(probably one of the Burton footnote, but it could have been Lane),
that what a Medival Arab would have done to toast an individual, would
have been to offer a prayer for a companion, a member of the Royalty
or a worthy person being awarded, to which the assembly would
have responded, "Amen!" (It is the same word with the same meaning in
Arabic, Hebrew and English)

On remarking upon this to Lord Golden Gryphon (the Carolingian
Pursuvant), he said that his European persona probably would have done
the same thing.  Perhaps it is something which should be tried in
court.  Muhammad of Someplace gets an award of arms.  The herald
cries, "May Lord Muhammad of Someplace Enjoy good health and life, and
continued service to the kingdom," and the populace cries "Amen!"
Maybe it doesn't have the same ring as "Vivat!" but it might be

P.S.  Is it true that the Barron of Settmoor Swamp has outlawed the
saying of "Ribbet" after the "Vivat"s?

P.P.S.  Ever gone to a non-SCA event and had somebody offer a toast
and watch everbody stand around and not know what to do?

 	At the Shire of Elfsea's annual Defender tourney the last couple
of years, they have had the campground divided up into 3 or 4 camps 
along persona guidelines.  One for Norse, one for French and English
Normans, one for Celts, one for late period and probably others for
other such things.  While I havn't attended (14 hours being a bit of a 
drive for a one weekend event  :-), perhaps one of our readers in
Ansteorra can comment (Elfsea is Fort Worth.)  It certainly *sounded*
like fun in thier listings in Blackstar, and is a sort of hybrid 
of the idea expressed above.  Not groups, but camps.  Certainly setting
aside an area or three at Pennsic for this kind of thing, along with the
traditional regional set up, would be interesting...

Message-Id: <2272@canisius.UUCP>

Welcome once again, to Dagonell's Swap Shop and Emporium.
Today we have gift catalogs to help you find the perfect X-Mas or 
Twelfth Night gift for that special scadian in your life.

But first, some old business.  I offered and requested several items previously
and I'd like to share the results with you.

	- THE FESTIVAL OF THE ICE DRAGON; reservation information, pentathlon
info and advance entry forms : I offered these to anyone who asked for them as
I did not want to set the precedent of posting event announcements on the net.
Hoo Boy! In four days, according to the sys-op, I got more mail than
everybody else on this computer combined gets in the average month.  I have
all of your addresses backed up on tape, so if you haven't heard from me yet,
please be patient.  I also made the mistake of announcing that the rules were
cast-in-stone.  I got flooded with suggestions for new categories, etc.  To
be utterly fair, the Ice Dragon committee got together, reviewed them all and
decided to implement ONE change.  The categories for vocal and instrumental
music have both been split into SOLO and GROUP performance categories.  It was
too late to get the update into the Jan. issue of Pikestaff, however the
chroniclers have told me that the update will be printed in the Feb. issue.
All of the chroniclers of the EK's Western Region have been sent the current
info.  Permission is given to publish pent rules and reservation info with
the obvious condition that you do not change the text.  You may photo-reduce
as well.  The pent entry forms may also be published in the local newsletters
however, you may not reduce them in size.

	- EK's WESTERN REGION PROPOSED PRINCIPALITY LAWS; I have not yet
finished putting these on line.  I will be sending copies to those gentles
who asked for them as soon as I get out from under the Ice Dragon requests.

	- THE SONG "Cold Iron" BY LESLIE FISH; Thank you all who wrote,
for those who are also interested, write to : Firebird Arts and Music,
P.O. Box 453, El Cerrito, CA 94530.

	- THE SONG "A dove displayed, etc."; I've been told it's in the 
An Tir Songbook, but no one knew who to write to for copies.  I was also
told that the badge was registered to him behind his back.  How do you
register a badge behind the back of the kingdom herald??

	- THE "KNIGHT" (CA) LICENSE PLATE; No one so far has told me anything
on this, however Diablu informed me that the city of Schnectady has just
issued an entire series of plates with the letters SCA on them.  Maybe we
should call it SCA-nectady? ;-)

	- MOST PROLIFIC SCA WRITER DISCUSSION; No one has submitted their
favorite author for the privilege, however a number of people have noted that
the Steward can really crank out the verbage.

	- BACK ISSUES OF HERALDIC SYMPOSIA; Brigantia herald (EK) has 
promised to look into which ones are available.

And now, for the X-mas gift list.  Because I have a childish delight in
receiving mail, I send away for every catalog I hear about.  I have a
number of catalogs that might be of interest for those who are trying to
find a gift for that special Scadian.

FIREBIRD ARTS AND MUSIC, PO BOX 453, EL CERRITO CA 94530 
	This is the catalog everybody recommended to me for the Leslie Fish 
song I was looking for.  In addition, they have a lot of other books and
tapes as well, mostly SCA-filk and SF-filk however there is a number of 
harp pieces as well.

PAST TIMES, GUILDFORD HOUSE, HAYLE, CORNWALL TR27 6PT, ENGLAND
	"A unique gift collection inspired by Britain's heritage" as it
says on the cover.  Celtic jewelry, needlework kits, coffee table books,
repros for some medieval works of art, manuscript designs on stationary,
etc.  The prices are all in British currency, so be sure to ask for the
US table of prices insert when you ask for it.

DAVID MORGAN, 11812 NORTHCREEK PARKWAY, N. SUITE 103, BOTHELL WA 98011
	The British Isles, specifically Great Britain, Ireland, Scotland,
and Celtic Britanny.  In addition to the type of stuff Past Times puts out,
they also offer the national heraldry on T-shirts, handbags, ties, etc.
Also national flags and national maps are available.

NOTE-ABLY YOURS, 6865 SCARFF ROAD, NEW CARLISLE OH 45344
	For the musician on your list.  Not only do they offer musical
instruments from penny whistles to concert harps, but also a variety of
items with musical themes, jewelry, bumper stickers, note pads, T-shirts,
greeting cards, etc.

DOVER PUBLICATIONS INC., 31 E 2ND ST., MINEOLA NY 11501
	It's not only a catalog of books, it's a catalog of book catalogs.
If you write and tell them what subjects you're interested in, they'll
send you one of their specialty catalogs.  For the SCAdian children on
your list, they have historical coloring books.  If some of the designs in
the Celtic Designs coloring book bear a more than passing resemblance to
your last tourney scroll, it's because a number of calligraphers I know
use these books as inspirations.  There are also books on history, cookery,
music, crafts, needlework, art, science, etc.

BELLEROPHON BOOKS, 36 ANACAPA ST., SANTA BARBARA CA 93101
	More children's historical coloring books.

JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC T-SHIRTS, OUTER PRODUCTS, BOX 88, LAFAYETTE HILL, PA
19444
	Have you ever wanted a T-shirt with the family tree of the War of
the Roses on it? or music from Bach? or a labeled dinasaur skeleton?
This is where to get it.

AUDUBON WORKSHOP, 1501 PADDOCK DRIVE, NORTHBROOK IL 60062
	Everything for the Bird Watcher.

BEAR-IN-MIND, 20 BEHARRELL ST., W. CONCORD MA 01742
	The complete teddy bear catalog, those with a low sugar tolerance
are advised to avoid.

PREMIERE LIQUOR AND CHEESE, 3445 DELAWARE AVENUE, KENMORE NY 14217;
	Make sure you specify Delaware AVENUE, as there is also a Delaware
ROAD in Kenmore.  I have dozens of food and wine catalogs, however this is
the only one I'm going to recommend on the net.  In addition to the usual
food and wine gift packages, they carry an extensive assortment of culinary
goods; knife sets, specialty cake molds, books, rare herbs and spices, etc.
If if can be found in a master chef's kitchen, it can be bought at Premiere.
I HIGHLY recommend this one for the expert cook in your life.

THINGS YOU NEVER KNEW EXISTED ... AND OTHER ITEMS YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT,
JOHNSON SMITH CO., 35075 AUTOMATION DRIVE, MT. CLEMENS MI 48043
	The title of the catalog says it all.  Tarot decks, magic tricks,
mechanical banks, sf model kits, space shuttle patches, unicycles, rubber
ninja weapons and ninja suits, etc.  Items range from "That's clever." to
"That's weird." and only you can tell them apart.

	I have more catalogs, DOZENS more catalogs.  I just gave a sampler
of the more interesting ones.  If you are interested in anything else,
drop me a line, I might have something on it.  You'd be surprized at some
of the catalogs I have.  I'll bet you didn't know there was a gift catalog
for armchair mercenaries, did you?

Good point, Henry.  This illusion, which is seldom realized in my
limited experience, is an important goal to me, at least.

However, having a marginal persona myself (6th century Denmark, which
isn't properly Medieval at all ... try (pre-historic) Germanic Iron Age)
I have wrestled with this problem since I joined.  My solution
is that I moved to the Knowne World (which is not properly
anywhere in the Middle Ages anyhow) from Jutland.  I try to conform
to the rules of our Society, which are different from those to which
I am accustomed.  (Many SCA customs, like cloved lemons, Hole-in-the-
Wall, and lady fighters in tournaments would probably not be
familiar to ANYONE from pre-1601 Western Europe.)

To summarize, I conform to TSCA society.  I've heard lots of
other explanations of `how I got here', but they all boil down to this.
When in Rome, do as the Romans.

On another tack, people should not be limited by their persona.  
I don't want to have to create alternate personae (and do the 
associted research for them) just to practice heraldry, do pavanes, 
marry a 12th cen. Italian, or wear satin.

By the way, I'd be interested in hearing from people via net-mail on the
status of personae in their respective Kingdoms.  Back East
personae were a BIG THING and everybody seemed to have a persona
story, whereas Out Here (West) many people seem to get along fine 
without even knowing what locale or period they're from.

Subject:  "POOBAH!"

Greetings, and Happy Merry Whatever to all!

I would fain add to the stories behind the origins of the accolade, "Poobah!",
as Trimaris in a sense put it to unique use...

First, it must be told that whereas Duc Syr Merowald de Sylveastan had already
brought the cry of "Poobah!" to Trimaris at the time of my tale (I think),
the inspiration in this instance came from Gilbert and Sullivan's "The
Mikado".


Once upon a time in Trimaris, life and events had become serious.  Very
serious.  So serious, in fact, that some (who dwelt mostly in the then-Shire
of An Crosaire) felt that things were kinda boring and that it was high time
for some silliness.

And lo!  Sir Tetsuo Sakura, with the help of Mistress Enriqueta Isabel de
Reyes y Mora (and a number of other really warped individuals), created "The
Great Poobah!"  And it was decreed that at the St. Valentine's Day Massacre
(An Crosaire's anniversary event) the Great Poobah! would appear.

The Regalia of the Great Poobah! was created.  Apart from such essential items
as the bright turquoise fez with the dangling neon-pink pom-poms, and central
to the Regalia, was:  the Baku (which has since become legend)!  It should be
told that the Baku is a hobby-beastie (as in, hobby-horse) featuring a
stylized elephant's head done in pink and turquoise.  The creature is from
Japanese mythology, and was said to suck up bad dreams through its trunk.  The
Baku was to be the physical embodiment of the non-existent power of the Great
Poobah!:  whosoever held the Baku, held the title.   There were to be consorts
as well: the two Haboops-- billed as "Siamese Twits joined at the vocal
cords."

St. Valentine's Day arrived, and all looked forward eagerly to the Court of
the Great Poobah! on Saturday night.

A wondrous sight it was:  so many garish colors in so small a space!
Proceedings were not long under way when two crafty Ninja clad in black
clothing and bright orange tennis shoes came silently crashing through the
underbrush, whilst voices softly whispered "Lurk!Lurk!Lurk!
Sneak!Sneak!Sneak!" at the top of their lungs.  Before our horrified eyes, the
Great Poobah! was cruelly and foully slain with a bonker tube!  The Ninja made
off with the Baku-- and the hunt for the symbol was on!


RETURN OF REALITY:  Actually, the whole idea was for people to spend a good
portion of the event trying to steal the Baku from one another, vying to be
the Great Poobah! for a time.  What happened, was, that *no one* wanted the
damn fool thing!  So, the game turned into one of trying to trick some poor
schlemiel into taking the Baku into his/her hands so that then _they_ were
stuck with it!

Over the years, the Baku has popped up again and again.  There are some pretty
lively tales about exotic stunts pulled to get rid of it.  Count Sir Francois
of Meridies got stuck with the Baku once, and so it floated about that Kingdom
(much to their dismay) for a couple of years.  When finally the Baku came home
to Trimaris, it had acquired a mate:  the Bakette.  But, she is rarely seen.
The Baku itself was last seen (read: "foisted off") at last year's St. Val's.
Who knows when it will next appear?


Also heard in Trimaris these days:  "Ooh!  Aah!  Ohh! Ex-SPEN-sive!"

                              In Service, and with Best Wishes for All,

                                       Cher de Bellevue

Subject: Oak spearshafts.

My favorite spear is made of oak.  It's the one with the black kydex coil
tip.  It dates from the East Kingdom Inter-Kingdom Peace that was just
before the first Pennsic with a Bridge Battle.  It has warped slightly,
but i still consider it sound, and would use it tomorrow with a clear
conscience were it legal.  It came from the Rhyddric Hael (Buffalo, NY)
and i bought it from Morgan Ellandris herself.  It has served me well and
slain many valient warriors, including about a dozen at the TYC, where my
opponents kindly allowed me to use it though hardwood had already been
banned in several kingdoms.

As you can probably guess from the tone of the above, i think the ban
on hardwood spearshafts is on the paranoid side.  On the other hand, the
Society Earl Marshal is well within his rights to do so, and i must 
respect that right.  I think the ban is a symptom of the lack of even
Kingdom-wide standards for authorization, so that the safety standards
must be jacked up to protect the worst conceivable fighter from harm
even under conditions of lax enforcement.  This puts a tremendous burden
on everyone but keeps the insurance company happy, which is all that
counts from the Corporate point of view.

Sigh.  One of my buttons seems to have gotten pushed.  Please enclose

Subject:  signature files and multi-multi-postings...

Greetings milords and ladies--

I beg forgiveness for what will surely seem a needless posting, but for me
and perhaps others, is beginning to be necessary.

To all who have appended signatures to their letters, many thanks -- it does
help to know where you really are, how to address replies from BITNET, and
what Kingdom, etc. you write from, HOWEVER (and this is the peevish part, fair
warning) I receive this digest through the mailer, and when there are fourteen
postings from one person, it becomes an irritant to read the same signature
each time, not to mention the enormous chunks of disk space they eat up.  I
must be sure that you understand I do not say this to ask that the sig's be
removed, by any means -- rather, I ask that if you post many things one day,
post one sig; or maybe 2 -- one at the start, and one at the end.  I would
even ask that you put all replies into a single article, to avoid the huge
stack of From:, Date:, Reply-To:, etc. headers on each....

When I began receiving this digest, it was large.  Now it is huge, and getting
bigger, what with daily replies and reviewing of archives, which then are
replied to as well, plus the rebuttals of these.  Unfortunately, I cannot
access through ftp, as I am not on the USENet, and must receive it daily
by mail, which is charged to my disk quota.  Personally, I have a large enough
surplus (at the moment) that the digest can stay at its current size without
killing my ability to do anything before reading and, sad to say, deleting it;
but others may not be so lucky.

Sorry for the *flamish* tendencies found here...here's my minimalist sig:

Subject: Accolades
Message-Id: <8812142218.AA07347@davids.UUCP>

Someone was Vivat-ing Dana in a recent message and one of my
long-standing questions came to mind.

What are the various accolades in use in the society, and does
anybody know stories about how they came about?

What got me started wondering this is my first War.  I'd been going
to middle kingdom events for some time and had gotten used to
people saying PooBah when shouting out accolades.  Then at the
war there were all these strange easterners shouting out something
sounding like "Vivant!" (my persona is french so of course I would
use the french spelling).

I've since come to accept it, but I still prefer PooBah.  And also I'm
a little sad that the middle kingdom seems to have let the use of
PooBah slide ... they instead are tending to simply clap nowadays,
except there's also this strange habit with ooo's aaa's oooh's
and even murmur-murmur's.

Poobah is so much more fun.  Y'see, at my first event there were these
strange people camping behind us who started up a "fool's court" along
about 2 in the morning.  It was just like a real court, but lots of things
were changed around and it wasn't near as serious.  For instance, they
chanted "Oh yeah, oh yeah" to get peoples attention, and "pooh bear" for 
accolades.  The kinda thing you expect at 2 in the morning ....

(Then the next morning a bunch of them gathered around someone's tent
and chanted

	Biscuits & Beer! Biscuits & Beer!
	I want to get me some more Biscuits & Beer!

to the Kibbles & Bits commercial.)

Pardon me if this is stale commentary, but I'm reading all messages in the

Anyway, in reply to Moira Mathews on being "crown shy", hey, the king is just
this guy, you know? If it seems that the king only rewards folks he knows,
whose fault is it? It's yours! Crowns *want* -- desperately want -- you to
write recommendation letters. The Crown that gave me me my AoA didn't know me
from Adam, but I'm told they got fifteen letters recommending me. If you think
someone deserves an award, tell the Crown. That is your privilege and your
*duty* as a subject! If the king never heard of the person you're
recommending, how can he be expected to reward that person? Petition campaigns
work. Try it.

Subject: Yet another "Lord of the Dance"

This is specifically aimed toward Wendy Alberg (?), because the address
you've given won't work from my node.

I too have a version of Lord of the Dance, though it isn't quite in the
same vein as the previous submissions. Mine sounds more like a heavy metal
song with a little culture, if this is at all possible. Unfortunately, I
don't have sheet music for it, but the words follow:

        "Dance wherever you may be-
        For I am the Lord of the Dance," said he.
        "I lead you all, wherever you may be-
        Lead you all in the Dance," said he.

Ch:     I danced in the morning when the world was begun,
        I danced with the moon and the stars and the sun.
        I danced with the scribes and the Pharises,
        But they would not dance, they wouldn't follow me-

        I danced on their sabbath and I cured their lame;
        Their holy men, they said it was a shame.
        They whipped me, they beat me, they set me on high,
        They chained me to their mountain and left me to die-

        Chorus

        I danced in the morning when the sky turned black:
        It's hard to dance with the devil on your back
        He cut me down, but I leaped up high-
        I'm the life that will never, never die.

        Chorus

        Repeat Verse 1
/

Replies to SCA digest #136 (11/18)
C'mon, *any* word for the "other guys" is going to be perceived as pejorative.
There's nothing inherently wrong with "mundane"; it means "pertaining to the
world at large". (I've already commented more extensively on this and won't
bore you all again). As a herald and an SCA bureaucrat, I've found that
*everything* is offensive to *someone* out there! ...And the same goes for
"Scadian".
Did you know that the word "Sioux" comes from the Chippewa for "little
snakes"?

The Heraldic Symposium minutes are variously available from Lord Alban St.
Albans (Morsulus Herald) or from Free Trumpet Press (the East/Middle heraldic
publishing consortium) or from Free Trumpet Press West (the Western
ssubsidiary). Your local herald should have access to Alban's address (I,
however, have misplaced it....) Free Trumpet can be reached via Laurel or via
Mistress Graidhne (Cecilia Weisenberger, BoD member).

At the Great Heraldic Conclave (when Wilhelm became Laurel and Karina retired)
Baldwin of Erebor sang his "Billet checky Or and gules" song. Wilhelm took
that as an official submission and registered it as a badge to Baldwin
(specifically stating that it was *NOT* to be taken as a precedent and that
rules on clutter were still in effect!)

Subject: Scadians, Mundanes, & Swimming Pigs

To Lady Marian Greenleaf:
With all due respect, my lady, you have it all wrong. You say that it is
incorrect and jarring to call an SCA member a "Scadian" in the context of
our re-creations (i.e. "in persona"), and that it's better to say "SCA
member", or words to that effect.

The term "SCA member" has no place in the lexicon of a 15th century Welsh
baron. A "Scadian", well, obviously that's someone from a place called Scadia,
wherever *that* is, perhaps far to the East or, more likely, maybe Norway --
it does sound like Scandia, after all. "Scadian" does not make me cringe. What
makes me cringe is standing in Royal court, reading a beautiful scroll that
looks like it was calligraphed and illuminated in 1408...except that it refers
to something called "the Society for Creative Anachronism". Now whatever might
*that* be. Probably some heretical sect of renegade monks.... It's the
"mundane" references like "SCA" and "the Society" and "Corporate Chronicler"
and "Board of Directors" that bother me when used _within_the_context_of_our_
roleplaying_. That's why I say, the SCA needs an overall persona name, and
"the Laurel Scadian Empire (on a parallel with the "Holy Roman Empire" [_pace_
John Trimble_]) fits the bill. A member of MSR is a subject of the King of
Acre (I've heard "an Acrian"). A member of the Marland Medieval Militia is a
"Marklander". The Tuchux are Tuchux. Members of the Kingdom of Adria (see
current TI) are presumably Adrians. What do you call SCA members? You call
them Scadians. No problem.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Regarding Arval comment on the "Shire of the Swimming Pigs":
I founded the Committe for the Suppression of SCA Branch Names that Don't
Sound like Places. In a Letter of Comment some time ago I made an analogy of
sorts. Basically, I pointed out that in the real world you have names like
"New Swynfordshire", but in the SCA we tend to name our branches "the
Incipient Shire of the Wading Pigs". Note that they both mean the same thing,
but that the latter example doesn't sound like a _place_, it sounds like a
_chapter_of_a_club_. That's a perceptual hurdle we have to get over. (Another
popular hypothetical example is "the Principality of the Dancing Blue
Unicorns".) I agree wholeheartedly with Arval: I don't say I'm from "the
Canton of the Towers in the Barony of Carolingia" any more than I say I live
in the City of Malden in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. I live in Malden,
Massachusetts; and I live in "Towers, in Carolingia".

Thank you for your very insightful letter. Your points, once I read them,

_________________

To Rewolof:
I refer you to my article "Why We are Here: A New Definition of the Society"
in the Philosophers' Corner of Pikestaff, (March '86, I believe...I'll send 
you a hard copy).
The gist of the article was that the SCA is more than an educational
foundation *AND* more than a game. Our SCA activities have a mundane validity,
in the following sense. If this were a game, an armorer would make a helm that
is as safe and comfortable as possible, without regard to period armoring
methods or to the final appearance of the piece. On the other hand, if we were
an pure educational foundation, the armourer would strive to make the most
accurate reproduction possible of a period helm, and then he'd put it on his
mantelpiece or somesuch and admire it. An SCA armourer does neither of these
things, because he is making neither a piece of sports equipment nor an objet
d'art. He's making a helm. A _real_ helm, and when he's done he's going to put
it on and fight in it. It's sports equipment *and* it's an artistic
reproduction and it's both and it's neither. It's what it is. The SCA is what
it is, too. We're not "just a game". "The game isn't over till it's over",
someone once said. Well *this* game is open-ended, and it exists (for many of
us) even when it isn't being actively played. We avoid making up the rules as
we go along (altho' we don't avoid it *enough*) because we take the undeniable
truth of history as our Prime Directive. We don't (or shouldn't) arbitrarily
change history to suit our fancy. If chocolate wasn't period, we don't serve
chocolate at our feasts, for example. On the other hand, we don't want to
really kill each other, so we use rattan clubs and pretend they're steel
swords...that's a *necessary* compromise.
The other side of the coin is that we recognize the existence of the
imagination during the middle ages. That's why we're more than a stuffy
educational institute. We don't say "That sleeve is forbidden until you can
show me the renaissance painting in which it is shown". We allow a little
creativity, but within the boundaries of a reasonable adherence to period
cultural forms.
The major point of this whole rant is that I think I know why we're here, and
not even the BoD has ever figured that out. We are _not_ "recreating the
Middle Ages as the should have been". We are _not_ "an educational institution
dedicated to research on the Middle Ages".

WE ARE THE FOLLOWING:

"THE SOCIETY FOR CREATIVE ANACHRONISM EXISTS TO PROVIDE AN ENVIRONMENT
FAVORABLE TO THE PRACTICE AND CONSEQUENT PRESERVATION OF VARIOUS WORTHWHILE
ASPECTS OF MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE CULTURE".

In other words we're a place where people who do medieval stuff can interact
with other people who do medieval stuff. That satisfies both poles of the
"Creativist/Authenticist" debate. It's educational. And it's fun!

To the gentle who requested heraldic assistance:
The field division you show is indeed "tierced per pall reversed", also known
as "per graft". The "mullet of eight eleongated at the cardinal points" is a
charge that is very rare, if not unheard-of in mundane heraldry, yet very
common in SCA heraldry, where a term has been invented for it. It is a
"compass star".

        I do cast my nets.
Where dost thou cast them?

To the person who requested info on alternate personas....
Many folk do this. It's useful to have a persona that's more appropriate
for a given event. I'm Samuel ben-Isaac a Khazar living in (and enamored of)
Byzantium in the 11th cent. In fact, Samuel was my first persona, it's just
that it got uncomfortable having do all the things he was doing (like dances
from the Italian Renaissance, and heraldry...). Alt-personas in the SCA can't
have devices (arms), so most folk register badges for them, and use them as
devices anyway. (Sigh).

Various & sundry replies.....
ON MONASTIC ORDERS: Certainly, I'm not going to dictate or question another's
religious beliefs, but I have to admit that my initial gut reaction to
Yaacov's comment was, "Hey, dude, chill out!". This is a game, and we're
playing roles. I'm Jewish too, but my role is that of a good 15th century
Christian, whose father founded a monastery and who became a Franciscan in the
close of his life. It's equivalent, say, to playing an Archbishop in a play.
Surely, doing so is not sinful.
Well, I don't wwant to get into heated discussions of religion. I think I've
made my point. The Church was *the* focus of the age we recreate, and we ought
not be so paranoid about it, that's all.

PERIOD KNITTING: Lady Elaigne Kerr is an acknowledged expert on the subject. I
don't have her address at hand, but she's local (i.e. to Carolingia, where I
am). Arval, could you note her address?

Oops, I sent the last letter before I was thru; where was I?. Oh, yes....
PERSONA-GROUPS: The phenomenon of having a Welsh seneschal, a Polish marshall,
and a Japanese herald is called, in SCA jargon, anachronism. As in the Society
for Creative Same. Having branches based on persona is an interesting, but (I
feel) unworkable idea. The geographically-based chapters we use have obvious
advantages that other bases don't share. What you"re describing is more or
less the "Great Household" concept, like the Great Household of the Dark
Horde, which has an extremely well-developed group-persona. You could
encourage people to assciate into such entities, but building the club upon
such a structure is, I think, not feasible.

Subject: Secret Societies

Don't get paranoid about secret societies. There's something you have to
understand, and that's that there are two meanings for this term.
The first is "a society whose existence is secret". This is what most people
*think* they mean when they use the term. We are certainly not this sort of
entity. Everyone has access to the fact of our existence, even if they aren't
able to join. But *we* aren't restricting anyone.
The second meaning is "a society with secrets". This is what most uses of the
term are actually getting at, even if the speakers don't realize it. What
kinds of groups fall into this category? Well, you college fraternity, for
one. The Freemasons, Odd Fellows, Knights of Columbus, Moose, et al. The US
Congress, for that matter, but that isn't usually what's meant. What are our
secrets? Why, our modes of recognition, of course. We don't tell outsiders
*that*, but who we are, what our purpose is, how you too can join -- that
isn't secret in SCAnet *or* in my Masonic lodge.

Subject: On being a firebrand...

I've been thinking about my comment to Yaacov ha-Mizrachi, and I'd like to
apologize for being a bit too snarky. Strongly-held religious convictions are
a good thing (I have 'em, too, 'tho mine are probably unique). I didn't mean
to question his.

However....

Questions of religious offensiveness used to come up quite a bit when I was a
commenting College of Arms member, and one thing that used to annoy me was the
SCA's two-sided pretzel-logic on the subject. The way it works is like this:
An X-ist can't have X-ist symbolism because pious X-ists will be offended that
he's using X-ist symbols in a silly game. On the other hand, he cand use Y-ist
symbolism because the Y-ists will be upset at the use of Y-ist symbols by an
X-ist. And the same works for the Y-ists, in the opposite direction. So
everything interlocks, *any* use of religious symbols offends *everybody*, and
nobody ever uses *any* religious symbolism....except of course, for pagan
symbolism, because, as we all know, there are no real pagans these days. Sigh.
Yes, that's a simplification, but all I really wanted to say was that I think
we in the SCA are too paranoid about this issue, and the best response is not
*avoidance* of religion, but *tolerance*. Sorry, it's just another one of my
"flame" buttons. Feel free to stomp on me if I go over the edge again.

Subject: News on the Rialto (A Name for our Shire)

Arval suggests that we call ourselves an Order and pattern ourselves after
a monastic order. This seems appropriate as it allows us to do something not
everyone is privy to; it's close to, but more authentic than, Kobyashi's
"secret society" idea.
Now, the patron saints of messengers are two: Gabriel the Archangel (the angel
of the Annunciation) and John the Baptist (who spoke of himself as heralding
the coming of the Savior). Personally, being Jewish, I favor Gabriel as a
figure of veneration, and John's patronage is, I think, a little too obscure.
The Order of St. Gabriel the Messenger, called the Gabrielites. I like that,
if I say so myself.
(....Actually, in John's favor, I've fancied myself "a voice crying in the 
wilderness" [of the SCA] for some time....)
_____________

Now, as regards a device, I don't see anything wrong with this, but perhaps
an unobtrusive token of some sort might work better. If a device is chosen,
though, a net of some sort is certainly the most appropriate charge. If there
*is* an alchemical symbol for Aether, that would be nice, too.

______________

As I read both current and proposed Corpora, I believe it may be possible to
actually form a shire-equivalent of widely-dispersed members (something like
the old "charter baronies" -- I think Storvik was the only one). 
*** I AM NOT NOT NOT SAYING THAT THIS IS A GOOD IDEA *** Only that it's
possible. I think. (Personally, I think we're most closely a guild-equivalent.
I think we are (at least a part of) the Imperial Academy of Philosophy I and
some others have been trying to form. What a neat surprise to find that it's
been more or less done already!)

Subject:  face thrusts in fencing

Good Fiona (and everybody else),

        Your comments on face thrusts in fencing struck a particular vein
in me.  I used to be scared horribly by them - and I still start just a little.
However Captain Danulf (my teacher, Captain of the Carolingian Rapier Company)
tought me to deal with it by spending half an hour rapping me alongside the
head with his blade (not a "good" blow) and then scoring a "good" thrust to my
chest while I was paralyzed with fear.  What can I say, it worked.  I still
start a little, but I don't stop fencing or drop my guard anymore.
        However, I do have a small problem with face thrusts, as I have a
little trouble diffrentiating between a good face slash and a whippy sabre
style pop (the former is good, the latter is not).  Of course a good face
thrust is impossible to mistake.  Which kind of explains the heavy list
restriction against them.  A fencing blade makes its presence known in a face
thrust - a havy list spear could cause serious neck problems - at least I think
that is part of the rationale.

        Your other concern is more important (to me anyway).  You asked what
would happen if you thrust to the face of an opponent who had a mask that was
not up to snuff.  As you say, it would be lethal.  period.  the solution
however, is not to outlaw fencing thrusts to the face, but to enforce the
regulations about armor.  A good mask is a necessity (just a little more so
than a cup).  Unfortunately it is orten difficult to tell if a mask is good
by looking at it.  The only way to tell is to use a punch-test.  The punch-
tester is a small tool with a spike on the end.  It is punched at the mask and
if it can move the mesh sufficiently to slip thru the holes, the mask is not
safe.  This does _not_ hurt the mask, whether it passes or not!  Unfortunately,
the punch-test is not used by EK marshals (I don't really understand why).
In my opinion not using the punch-test is the most dangerous practice in the
East Kingdom.  (What do other Kingdoms do???

        just my 2. . .3 . . . well 31 cents

I think that we can choose a middle ground.   The society should be called
one of the things we have been bandying around, but which one it is should be 
a secret.  Likewise with the symbol and the password.  of course, a la time

Subject: Accolades  and Shouts

Unto the members of this net, and to Lord David le Casse',
greetings!
 
My lord, Syr Aldric, tells this story of the origination of the
Great Middle Kingdom Shout, which is, actually, "Hoobah".
 
During the reign of King Iriel, may he rest in peace, a group of
lovely maidens appeared to dance for King Iriel, Sir Merowald,
Finnvarr de Taahe, Mistress Caellyn, and some other Middle Kingdom
legends. One of these dancers was the lady Catherine Aimee Le Moyne,
one was Gwendolyn the Fair, and one was Queen Moira (in disquise).
These lovely maidens danced in the eastern style, with clothing
scarcely fit for the northern climes, but the approbation of the
crowd kept them warm.
 
At the end of the performance, Sir Merowald and King Iriel started
shouting "hubbah, hubbah!", but the group of royalty and peers
around them decided that such a cry was unsuitable for the use of
nobles, and the shout was modified to be "Hoo-BAH!"
 
My lord reports this as an eyewitness, as he was Sir Iriel's squire
at that time, and was waiting on the head table during the incident.
 
In the course of time, as happens to all things, this cry has been
modified in some parts of the Middle to be "Pooh-bah" (perhaps this
comes from the Caer Anterth or Yararvellir, where the image of the
Great Bear is venerated?) or some similar cry. But the original, the
authentic, the REAL Middle Kingdom cry can still be heard in the
NorthWoods, where it was first heard.
 
I remain, in service to our Society,

Neither do I say that I'm from the Shire of Dragonsmark, but from Dragonsmark.
Nor do I say that I am from the City of Lexington in Urban-Fayette County
etc etc ...

BUT BUT BUT .. The Lexington-Fayette County Government does print its
full name when making official announcements.  And the Shire of Dragonsmark
does use it's full name in similar circumstances.  And I expect that in
medieval times similar practices were followed.

That is, there'd be a couple of names for a place -- one used in official
correspondance and the other used by the people who live there.  Kinda
like naming people.  There's official names and call names, nobody calls
me David Stephen Herron (*I* even have to look on my ID cards to see
how Stephen is spelled ..), they call me David, or Davey, or Dave, or

Gee, David, When I lived out there in the Middle, we used Hoo-ba (oo as in
shoot) as the cheer of approbation, in pairs as "Hoo-Baah! Hoo-Baah!" The
sound is similar to the Elizibethian "Huzzah!"

As to why it is used, that is a legend clouded by time (15 or so years). The
King of the Middle, Rolock I believe I was told (but it may have been
Bearingar), was the first to coin the term. An award was given to a lovely
lady and the King was heard to exclaim "Huba, huba!" Several around him
said "Say what?" (or its moral eqivilent) He covered by saying something
to the effect of "Er... Um... Hoo-Bah! Hoo-Bah! I was just cheering." This
became the cheer during his reign and was part of "Inviolate Tradition" by
the next coronation. This may be in error, but it is the traditional
explanation that I was given years past.  The King and/or time period may
be wrong.

In the East, a good court herald can get the populace to follow a lead, like
a choir or an orchestra. This results in a rolling "Vivat! Vivat! Vivat!"
Quite impressive.  If the aword is a fun one, sometimes the last Vivat is
followed by a "Yippee!" done in a Swedish accent. I heard the story behind
this, but I can't remember it all right now. Do you know it, Steffan? The
"yippee" occasionally gets over done.

The Kingdom of Acre (MSR), a different Mideval group, uses "Ave" as their
cheer. Some friends say that they are hard pressed not to respond "Maria" to
this.

So what about the other parts of the known world? What is traditional in the
West? Caid? Drachenwald? Oz er.. I mean Australia? :-) Enquiring minds want to
know. :-)

Thanx for reminding me -- (I knew there was a 'sh' sound in the word, but I 
know fairly little about wood) 

I liked those spears -- I learned with a Feral ash spear... it bent... it did
not flop -- the fiberglass spears sound interesting, but I wonder -- when they
break, is there any fiberglass dust?  Fiberglass dust in the eyes, or breathed,
can be fairly damaging.  Was there any reports of this at Pennsic? 

On a marshalate question -- years ago there was an incident of a fighter 
"planting" his spear and another fighter marching onto that spear.  That was
a lot of pressure (200+ pounds of fighter pressing on a three inch circle).
I heard complaints about this practice, was taught not to do it, but I never 
have seen it outlawed -- is it forbidden -- if not, do you think it should?

I know that they banned the ash spears -- who could forget the BOD meeting at 
the war :-) ...the East was somewhat upset at this ruling.

standard?  well -- in my flawed memory :-) -- I have not faced an oaken spear 
in my practice and fighting experience, dating since 1983, and there were no 
oaken spears in Northern Outpost (of course there was little of anything else 
up there to speak of :-)  ...how about some other veteran fighters out there?
Arnoff, Koby?  When did you last see an oaken spear?

Bart -- you find fencers thrust hard?! I am surprised -- it is inefficient 
to hit another with more than 750gr of force...  at least that is the case
with olympic style fencing.

Well put, Lord David!  This is precisely the point.  Consider, though,
a typical "bad" SCA placename: The Shire of the Swimming Pigs (to take
a random example!).  If you use the full, official name, it sounds
just fine:

"His Royal Majesty Baldassare il Magnifico summons into His Court his
Seneschal and Knight-Marshall for the Shire of the Swimming Pigs!"

It's got just the right ring to it.  BUT...this name does not have a
reasonable unofficial name.  I mean, would you want to have to greet a
pleasant young lady with:

"Hi!  I'm Lord Guarin, from Swimming Pigs."

By the time she had picked herself off the floor and wiped the tears
from her eyes, the dancing will be over.  

Placenames, as Master Steffan puts it so well, should sound like place
names! 


> M'lord Steffan, I dare say that you write quite a bit 

Yoou sure are right, David.  And I thought I was verbose!

Subject: Fencing Face Thrusts



Fionnghuala Siobhan nic an Chlerich  asks about face thrusts during
fencing.  A face thrust with a rattan broadsword (or spear) to a fighter
wearing a SCA padded helm is a very different animal from a face
thrust with an epee to a fencer wearing a fencing mask.

With the rattan list face thrust, a heavy blow is delivered to the
face, and must be absorbed by the face padding of the helm and the
neck (thus risking danger of neck injury).  The weapon diameter is at
least 1/4 inch wider than the openings in the helm, so it will not go
through unless the weapon breaks, leaving a sharp point.  Furthermore,
the fighter typically hides behind a large sheild, leaving two targets
exposed, his face and his thigh.  Thus the face is a prime target, and
fighter (especially spearmen) would thrust for it if it was available.  

A fencing thrust is much lighter (> 8kg pressure in theory), and the
weapon will bend to take up some of the slack (although if your
fencers are typically getting two inch bends in their epees, they are
hitting two hard and will quickly wear out the weapon).  The armour on
the neck allows the head to move freely, thus there is little danger
to the spine.  In order for there to be an injury, (1) the blade must
break, and (2) the mask must fail.  All fencing masks are designed to
take at least 8kg of pressure by a sharp object before admitting it.
Because of a few problems in Olympic style fencing, the USFA has
recently (in the past 4 years) increased the standards for masks to
12kg.  The SCA and the NCAA have not yet adopted the new standard,
mainly for financial reasons.  Furthermore, in a typical fencing
stance, the arm and the chest provide much closer targets than the
face.  Prohibiting face thrusting would not substantially reduce the
risk of injury.

If you are concerned about injuring your opponents, there are two
things you can do.  (1) Encourage them to use 12kg masks.  [Note: the
same rules change which went from 8 to 12 kg required sewn in bibs,
something which is not necessary in the SCA because of separate neck
protection requirements.  If you are ordering a mask, resist the
temptation to get one without a sewn in bib, it probably only barely
meets the 12 kg standard]  (2) Make sure your blades are in good
health, you are only likely to cause an injury (other than a bruise)
with a broken blade.  As a fencing instructor, I prefer getting thrust
in the mask to being repeatedly thrust in the same spot in the chest.
Furthermore, most fencers hit with much less force in the mask than
they do in the chest, and as the mask is further away, they are less
likely to have misjudged the distance, and accidentally hit too hard.
If you are flinching everytime you get something that even vaguely
resembles a face thrust, have a friend take a foil and poke you for a
while in the face.  You will eventually see that you protection really
is adaquate there and you need not worry about injury, except for
broken blades.

Peace be upon you.

On boy!  This happens to be something I've kinda made a collection of.
The following are based solely on my own observation, and I hope
errors will be pointed out.

In the East, we cheer "Vivat!" three times.  (Long life!), "Vivant!"
in the plural. In the reign of Sigfried I, it became common to
throw in a "Yippee!" after each or just after the last cry.  The one
traditional exception to this pattern is at Coronation.  Coronation
cermonies are traditionally ended with "Long live the King!", right
after the herald has finished reading the Rolls Royal.  "Vivat" is
also used in Atlantia.

In the Middle, as Lord David & Lord Bart have noted, the cry is either
"Poo Bah!" or "Hoo Bah!", depending on who you talk to.  I hadn't
heard that story, Bart: Thanks.  At Pennsic War court a few years ago,
when (then) Sir Thad trundled into Court in a bear suit, the cry was
"Pooh Bear!".

In Caidan courts, I have heard the cry "Huzzah!"

There are also local variants.  In Trollhaven, a canton in the Barony
Beyond the Mountain, the cry is often "Ee-waniwah!" (phonetically
rendered), which is said to be Trollish for "Damned good thing".

   Regarding fears of face thrusts with rapiers and other light weapons:

   As I understand the rules (I am fairly familiar with them, being among
the first authorized fencers when Eastern fencing returned ~3.5 years ago),
the requirement is for a three weapon mask, gorget, and leather/equivalent
hood on the back (for melee combat, etc).  A three weapon mask must withstand
a 'punch test' (details, anyone?) that checks to see if the mesh is good.
   A 'light' weapon is just that - light.  The only way that force can be
transmitted is really through the mass of the fencer and the rigidity of the
blade.  The only bad incident I have ever heard substantiated was when a
fencer, I believe in the Olympics, broke an epee in an extension lunge, and
pierced the heart of his opponent with the broken blade.  Note that extension
lunges are not legal in the East.
   The major danger I see with adequately protected fighters and face thrusts
is in rattan combat - where the speed and mass of a nine foot spear combine
with an overenthusiastic thrust to break someone's neck.  (You might be able
to guess at my opinion of bringing face thrusts to the East.)  The flex of
light weapons and the _lightness_ of same combine, IMHO, to keep face thrusts
perfectly safe.

Also, replies to specific queries should be handled via net-mail 
rather than the news facility.  (I'm tired of hearing replies to the
"mullet of eight with cardinal points elongated".)  

Authors of such queries should remind people to respond via net-mail.

(If the answers are of general interest, they can be summarized
by the requestor.)

Yup, we (An Tir) do Hip-Hip-Hoorah led by the Herald as well. (Not a
surprise, us being an ex-principality of the West.) And yes, the end of
court is marked by "Long Live King SoAndSo and Queen WhatsHerName"
"Long Live Prince.... and Princes....."
"Long Live the Dowager Princess Janeltis"
(each phrase being repeated by the populace after the herald.)
Then at the end: "Three Cheers for An Tir, Hip-Hip!"  "Hoorah!"

There's also an unofficial sorta cheer done when a really spiffy item is
presented to TM's or a knock-'em-down scroll is presented: the populace as
a whole murmers/rumbles/whispers "Ooooohh. Ahhhhhhh. Wowowow." and sometimes
breaks into applause.

May this humble Mundane offer to you the following?


    Great Thunderballs of Death

is impossible to translate directly --
Latin word ending change based on their use in a sentence.

However, allowing for some liberties (ala Medieval [Gutter] Latin)
I arrived at:

    magnis globis tonarent necis (vasto)

which means:

    
    (using) great/large/powerful balls (of such a sort) that thunder
    of (belonging to) death/destruction, (I destroy / vasto)

eliminating the subject/verb, vasto, you get:

Subject: Re: Non-European Personas/Secret Society Badge
Message-Id: <995@bacchus.dec.com>


     Perhaps the answer to the questions you've raised lie not in whether
we would have run across these people given a historical context, but
whether could we have run into them given a more cosmopolitian society?

     Certainly early explorers were running into them. If we accept the 
premise that Eirkson discovered America before Colombus, that means 
Indians were contacted by the Europeans and therefore, obstensibly could
be added to the idea of the Western Period we recreate. Now, I know I'm 
pushing this, but it *is* possible.

I think part of your frustration, (and that's what I'm sensing
here), is that you'd like the Society to be big enough to accept personas
of any type, but you'd like to retain the Camelot atmosphere whilst doing
so. (Since IMHO we're setting ourselves up for a fall trying to mimic the
Middle ages as they existed, rather than the way we'd *like* them to be).

     I've often thought that the Society should be large enough to encompass
the realms of persona that bordered on the time periods and cultures, (Western
Europe), that are Society Sandard. Hence, Arabic and Middle Eastern, 
Mongolian,  Eurasians and even Chinese personas are probably o.k. to mingle,
Japanese might push the bounderies but, hey, we can streach the old 
imagination here, who really does it hurt?

     And maybe that's what it all boils down to.....who are we hurting here?
Is the Society so insular that we can't afford to make new friends and involve
new people because they insist on a persona which doesn't meet the standard 
generic Celtic/Norse/Middle European mold that we've come to expect? I'd hate
to think that a group which prides itself on chivalry and honor and 
friendliness would allow a simple persona to disrupt them to the point of
bickering and disharmony. The average person joining will conform and if they
don't want to, well, let them march to the tune of a different drummer. It 
just makes the world a little more colorful, that's all.

     Now that I've offended everyone, let's do it again.

     When Danulf first put this coffee clutch together, the idea here was to
make new friends and meet people and talk about the Society in the hopes that
we'd be the start of the "new" age of intercooperation between the kingdoms.
Now, here we are arguing over this Secret Society concept, what badge will
we use, how will we identify ourselves, will the hearlds accept the design, 
etc. 

     Let's agree on one identifying device. I favor the fishnet. If you want
a badge, use one. Don't worry about registering it, (time to anger all the
hearlds here), just use it. All this fluff is just getting in the way of us
meeting at events and chatting face to face as friends should do.

     And with that, here's a little teaser, I'll be in an Tir at 12th Night.
I'll be wearing the fishnet and I'll try and follow the Secret Society 
passwords......but if you miss, or I do, just look for the guy in the white 
fishnet stockings.....;-)

The opinions here are just from one troll lurkin' under the Rialto,

Best,

From:     <CRF%IFASGNV.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU>
Subject:  Numerous and varied topics

Greetings!

I'm in agreement with our inscrutable-but-esteemed Chairperson of the Rialto
(namely, Danulf) that it's time the discussions moved on.  Therefore, I'd like
to comment on those topics he listed in #187, as well as a couple that
appeared in #189.

CAVALIER PERSONAE:  This topic has arisen in Trimaris more than once, as we
have a number of prominent cavalier-types.  The way I've always viewed it, the
development of the gun plus the development of certain philosophical ideas
form the main bases upon which historians deem the 17th century as the
"beginning of Modern History."

On the other hand, it's an extremely transitional era in human history and it
ain't exactly the Industrial Revolution in full swing.  Also, to the best of
my knowledge, there is _no_ existing historical re-enactment group for the
first half of the 17th century (for the second half, there is a "Jane Austen
Society").  So, the cavaliers apparently have nowhere else to go!  This, taken
together with the lack of industrialization between 1600 and 1650, has always
inclined me towards the full acceptance of cavalier personae in the SCA.  Nor
does doing so strike me as much of a stretch of the span and variety we
already encompass.

Besides which, as has already been noted:  they're neat people; and *sooooo*
romantic...

NON-EUROPEAN PERSONAE:  I'm all for them.  They were part of the medieval
world too, and there is _so_ very much to be learned from gentles whose
interests lie elsewhere than Europe.  I thought about this very topic during my
vacation.  I was at the Denver Art Museum, on a free tour with one of the
docents.  I knew more about the Japanese swords, kimono, lacquering, and
calligraphy than she did; and I owe my gaining that knowledge and appreciation
directly to my friends with Japanese personae.  This illustrates precisely
what I mean.

There's another benefit to be gained through non-European personae.  Let's say
you're a Kingdom Officer, or harried autocrat, or whatever, and don't want to
be bothered for a while.  You can temporarily adopt the persona of an obscure
South American Indian who speaks a little-known dialect, play the persona to
the hilt, and ignore everyone for a little while:  after all, you don't speak
the language, no matter which one!  (There is a Trimarian who used to be known
for pulling this stunt upon occassion.)

Finally, as a Trimarian, I must note that in summer non-European personae can
be a *lot* more comfortable!

ARTS/SCI COMPETITIONS:  Another touchy, much-discussed subject.  In my
experience, the areas of complaint break down into:  1) the way the contests
are run (especially as regards "who wins"); and 2) judges and entrants
complaining about each other.

Trimaris developed several mechanisms to deal with the former, most of which
have worked fairly well.  These include:  a limited number of categories, with
different categories every time; a limited number of entries/person/category;
anonymous, numbered entries to help minimize personal bias; a constraint that
the item being entered must have been completed within the preceeding year
(there is a "Long-term Projects" category for applicable entries); and
specialized categories such as "SCA items" (i.e., adaptations for SCA use) and
"Historical Costuming" (i.e., all _visible_ stitchery must be by hand).  Also
of importance is our scoring system:  we have no First, Second, and Third,
etc.  Rather, each individual entry is scored on a variety of aspects (point
distribution weighted towards research and the effort made) which are then
totalled.  The total number of points achievable per entry is (surprise!) 100.
 Your point total determines your level of recognition (Outstanding Merit;
Honorable Mention; etc.)  One competes only against oneself, with the
potential for every entry to place.  There are special "Best of Show" awards
for the Arts and the Sciences, as well as top-point placings for individual
Arts and Sciences and top-scoring group (who then gets their arm twisted to
autocrat the next Arts/Sci...).

As far as #2 goes:  oh, if only I've had a nickel for every time I've stood on
_this_ soapbox...

We are a bunch of amateurs.  When it comes to Arts/Sci competitions we are
amateurs judging other amateurs, and trying to make all of the people happy
all of the time.  Which won't work.  So, I think the important thing to
remember is:  we can never make the system perfect, only as equitable as
possible.

The last thing I would like to say is:  I discovered when serving as an
officer of the Trimaris Royal University that for every valid complaint that
can be made about judges and judging, a valid complaint can be made about
entrants and entries.  It all comes out in the wash.

"STRAIGHT HISTORICAL RESEARCH":  Sure, it deserves recognition; why shouldn't
it?  The catch is, what is the most appropriate form of recognition in any
given situation?  I could see it being publication in _Compleat Anachronist_
in the case of a major documentary effort, for example.  I've known one
disgustingly talented individual to produce jewelry by mining ore, smelting
it, drawing out wire, and then making the actual pieces all by his little
lonesome and by completly period techniques (except for safety precautions--
some of those techniques were _deadly!_).  The pieces have been much ooh'd and
aah'd over ever since, becoming almost legendary in some quarters (for the
masochism involved, if nothing else).  So, I guess it all depends.

"SOCIETY-WIDE ORGANIZATIONS":  Are a fine idea, just so long as there is no
Society-wide bureaucracy to go along with them; we have quite enough of that
as it is, thank you very much.  After all, who wants more Colleges of Arms?  I
favor the approach taken by a number of organizations, including (within the
Society) "Arachne's Web".  Namely, each chapter, regional association, or
whatever agrees to abide by the same set of rules, but is otherwise autonomous
(or as nearly so as possible).

"IS THE NET TOO AMERICAN?":  Not considering the demographics, in my opinion.
The vast majority of SCA'ers are Americans.  It then follows that the people
on the Rialto will be mostly Americans, and that the viewpoints will be mostly
American.  If the demographics change, no doubt we will all see it reflected
on the Rialto and elsewhere.  It is not (or, need not be) necessarily bad or
harmful to our function(s).  I think we Americans just need to make a
conscious effort to remember that the SCA is very much international these
days, and to remember the "worldview" these other cultures may represent.
Also, how much we can learn from them if we but take the time to ask (nicely,
of course!).

LOCAL MESSAGES AND NET VOLUME:  I also like to read announcements regarding
regional, Principality, and Kingdom events and happenings.  I too find them
informative.  But, I also have to agree that local and personal messages
should be avoided in the interests of space, unless absolutely necessary
(like, if your attempts at mailing direct keep failing-- which reminds me, I
am *still* trying to get Bjorn in the Barony of 3 Mtns. to contact me...).

As to the net volume:  since this is supposed to be a forum to enable us _all_
to be able to get to communicate with one another, I just figure the more the
merrier.  If I haven't got time to read it all, it's no big deal.  To me, the
important part is that the communication is there, and that it continues.  To
attempt to limit the volume might inadvertently limit communications.  I'll
take the volume, thanks.

"HEARD ANY GOOD STORIES LATELY?":  Only the one about Her Redundancy Baroness
Baroness Mistress Mistress Atalaya la Sanadora's cherry, but I'm not sure I
should repeat it here...

I thank everyone for their time and attention (assuming I still have it...)

    Subject: Re: Net protocol
    ...There is a solution, though: Distribution!
    If you are posting directly to alt.sca, you can limit the distribution
    of a posting by including a line which reads:
	Distribution: nj
    or something like that.  This line will prevent the message being
    passed to any machine outside the state of New Jersey.  Similar
    distribution restrictions exist for all sorts of geographical areas.
    If you want to post a message of purely local interest, simply limit
    the distribution to the area of interest.  Then, Danulf, you can have
    the digester ignore anything with a distribution smaller than, perhaps
    "alt", "world", "usa" or "na".

Milord Arval, doubtless your suggestion would work very well on Unix
machines which spread these messages via UUCP, and i join you in
encouraging those who read these words by courtesy of alt.sca to employ
such distribution restrictions for matters of local or limited-area
interest.
   However, many of us receive these words not via alt.sca but instead by
means of the SCA mailing list, and many of us use computers which are not
unixes, and so can not act on your suggestions. the automatic digestifier
Lord Danulf uses was written by a member of MIT's AI Lab in MIDAS, the
PDP-10 assembly language, and runs on MC.LCS.MIT.EDU, a KS-10 running the
ITS operating system; it is not susceptible of changes to add such
distribution headers as you suggest. so we who receive these messages via
the mailing list rather than the uucp newsgroup can only think twice about
the large-scale appropriateness of a message before sending it. we should
make this effort (to think) -- but we may err. as we all (uucp or
otherwise) are trying to be a society of courteous people, if someone
thinks another has make the wrong choice in this matter, s/he should assume
the errant one has good motives and intentions, and should correct him/her
gently and privately.

Subject: Games

Well, my best recommendation for games is to look up Baron (Master? I forget)
Sallamallah's books and tables (he had a booth at Pennsic this year, and 
probably takes it around a bit). He has board games pre-built if
you can catch his table; however, he is from Connecticut, so this probably
doesn't help people outside of the East. I understand that most or all of
the games that he sells are described in detail in his book on period
games, so you might keep your eyes open for that. Also, he has an article
in the Knowne World Handbook which describes some of the easier ones. A
couple of typical games:

Tanstaafl (yes, I think that's how it's spelled): This is one of those
games with very basic rules and very complex strategies. There are a number
of different versions of the game, from several different countries and
times. The initial layout has a square board, with an odd number of spaces
on each side. One side is the defender; s/he has a king in the center
space, and some guards surrounding. The other is the attacker, with twice
the number of men as the defender. The defender's goal is to get the
king "out" (to a corner on the small boards, or a side on the big ones);
the attacker's is to capture the king by surrounding it completely.
Captures are made by putting two of your men on opposite sides of an
opponent's piece.
This game is *tricky*, particularly on the large board (mine is something
like 17 x 17); the task of the attacker is particularly difficult, since
all pieces move like rooks -- simply opening up a rank or file that the
defender has access to is a guaranteed win for the defender. Easy to learn,
but quite involving.

Tamurlane's Chess: possibly the most baroque version of chess ever concocted.
All of the pieces you know are present, and about half again, on a 10 x 11
board. There are pieces that can only move exactly two, and pieces that
move like knights, only further. There is a piece called the Camel, which
is incredibly arcane -- it moves like a knight, *but* it cannot jump,
and must move at least *three* in the horizontal or vertical direction;
you can't even move the piece until endgame! You must usually checkmate
at least *twice*, due to the presence of the "Prince"; if the King is
checkmated, it may be "ransomed" for the Prince, trading places so that
the Prince is lost instead. It is also possible to promote two more
pieces to Princes, so it is possible that you have to checkmate *four*
times to win the game! Sick, sick, sick little game, but lots of fun if
you have several hours to play it in.

There are many other games in the book, ranging from fairly simple
dice games, to other awful versions of chess (played on a round board,
for example). Highly recommended; these games are a wonderful
distractant. Does anyone know where it can be mail-ordered (is it
available from the stock clerk? Raymond's Quiet Press?)?

Subject: Estoc verses the Rapier

Eddie and others:

The Estoc was a weapon developed to puncture through armour.  It is a 
square or triangualar cross sectioned sword designed for thrusting only.
It only point and was usually used on the joints of the armour.  It came
into play **I think** around the 14th century (I need to look this up --
Valentine has the exact date in his excellent book "Rapiers").

The rapier has its roots in the estoc, but was not used on men in armour.  It
is a lighter and longer weapon than the estoc.  While the estoc was weilded
by armoured and lightly armoured fighters/soldiers, the rapier was weilded
by civilians.  The rapier was a part of the gentleman's dress.  It made its
appearance in the early 16th century...

The rapier was used as a personal weapon in personal combat.  The majority
of this combat was in the form of duelling.  While George Silver disliked the
rapier, he himself engagedin duels and challenges.  The duel is a part of 
European culture as strongly as the cowboy is part of the American Culture. 

Rapier, in English speaking countries, primarily meant a weapon used to thrust
as well as cut.  The French used the term in a derogative sence.  Rapier is
a SPANISH term, and in many parts of Europe, "Rapier" meant spanish-sword.

I have more information on this... and can go on for days... but I think I have
covered this topic fairly fully at this point -- if you want to know more, 
give me a call.

Well, cousins, I'm afraid we can debate forever, but it seems that while we
were discussing the issue it has already taken form.  At an event this weekend
a gentle approached me:  "What news of the Rialto?" he asked.  As I was
cleaning up I heard the parting salutation:  "See you on the Rialto...."  I
can't say I'm displeased, it fit in the context of the event and, for the
first time, others weren't offended by the mention of computers or networking.

Subject: spears


oak spears were never to my knowledge allowed in EAST lists.  At least not
in the last 10 years... we did allow a flexible hardwood -- what was it, 
spruce?  I forget, but, it was flexible.  Not as flexible as rattan, but enough
to absorb the blow's impact and not enough to defer the accuracy of the spear.

In an attempt to standardize SCA language:  SPEARS thrust only, PIKES thrust
and strike (having a blade) and are refered to as Polearms!  Pikes *must*
be made of Rattan, while spears may be of Rattan or poltruded-stuff in the 
east...

***OPINION***
My over-all opinion on thrusting in rattan/heavy lists -- is that its 
calibrations is extreamly  heavier than necessary.  If we were really wearing 
chain then THRUSTING WEAPONS can puncture that chain easily.  Hitting with a
force to MOVE ME PHYSICALLY, would, if using a real spear, run me all the way
through -- a killing blow need only pierce my armour.  Since I do *NOT* have
a solid breastplate, I dislike thrusting weapons wielded by heavy brutes. The 
last thrust I received I felt for three weeks.   My experience WEILDING 
thrusting weapons is only summed up in the word "LIGHT".  
No matter how many time I hit the fighters with the tip, they considered it
light -- and that from fighters with *reasonable* calibration.

You are wrong, Danulf.  Until the BoD's ruling two years ago which
banned all hardwood spears, oaken shafts were standard in most parts
of the East.

Greetings,
  Gentles interested in medieval games are advised to get themselves
a copy of the Knowne World Handbook which includes descriptions of
many such games.  I believe there are also back issues of TI which
have carried articles on games.  One which may not be covered in any
of these is a game called nefl-tafl (or something like this) that
was played by the Norse.  If anyone is interested I'll go and dig
up my references to it.  I have played it and it is rather
challenging, being a chess-like game.  -Robert of Ferness

In a previous article, we are asked not to post Event notices to the net.

I enjoy reading about major events happening in other kindgoms that could
reasonably be expected to draw out of Kingdom visitors. Events that wouldn't
draw more than a few people could have the posting limited to the local area
instead of na (north america) or alt (the alt hierarchy);  a few of the 
southern AnTir events are limited this way, and it works very well.  Variety

hello!
we've had some discussion of heavy weapons (spears, etc) and 
thrusting, is there opinion on *light* weapons (ie fencing, 
swish-n-poke) and face thrusting? in the east, face thrusts are 
allowed, which is why 3-weapon masks are required. now, i'm just 
learning, and maybe as a "wire-weenie" i'm just a chicken who can't 
handle "real" fighting, but face thrusts scare me sh**less! not only 
in that i flinch, which i've been told i'll get over, but in that i'll
find a weak spot in some poor sod's mask and pftt. adios. has anyone 
heard anything about changing this? why do we allow face thrusts in 
light and not heavy weapons, and in kingdoms where rapier combat has been
around for a while what do y'all do about this?

Yike! It was ASH, a hardwood. Ash is flexible enough that it was sometimes
used as a bow stave, not as good as yew, but good enough.  It has a good
strength to weight ratio as well. Spruce is a softwood. It is like pine,
it breaks and splinters easily.

Ash was prefered by some not just for it's accuracy, but for it's punch. A
surgical strike was usually accepted so you didn't have to knock folks down,
much the same as the fiberglass spears we are starting to use.

I am not always as good about reading TI as I should be, and the marshallate
in the East is often slow to pass information down the chain, so could
someone explain why the Society Marshal (not the East Kingdom) really banned
hardwood spears? I have heard two reasons. The first was that they hit too
hard (like the fiberglass ones do) unless you were very familliar with
them.  The other reason I heard (separate and unique as THE reason) was that
someone in the western US had convinced a marshal that redwood was a
hardwood (it is not) and some poor clown ended up with a chest full of
splinters. Are either (or neither, or both) of these true?

Actually, I believe it is everywhere. Is that right Sir Alan?
(Pardon my editing, but I consider Pike and Spear to match,e.g. the multiple
man pikes in Alexander's Phalanx, both are mostly for thrusting. A Glaive is
a sword on a stick and sometimes mislabled as a pike rather than polearm.)
(Disclaimer: I have been wrong before and I am trusting my memory since
several of my arms books have wandered off.)

Thrusting calibration is a hard thing.  The blow must land with a pop, or it
is not noticed. I'm not sure this is right, but it is observed. The receiver
must feel that the blow would have defeated his armour.  The problem I have
mostly is philsophical: Are SCA spears spike point or leaf point?

The first, with a javalin head, defeats chain and padding quite well and
with a minimum of effort since it would open up the link it hits, but unless
you thrust through or hit something vital, you may not disable your opponent
("Oh, don't use a spear, that will only make him mad!" :-).

On the other hand, a leaf blade would have the same problem with chain over
padding that a sword does: the mail wraps around the point if it is not
split quickly, turning it into a punch with a stick. Painful, but not
necessarily disabling. On the other hand (am I out of hands yet? ;-), once
the armour has been defeated by a sharp pop, a wide spear head causes a
_lot_ of trauma for a minimum of ommph.

This difference is the culprit for a lot of the thrusting differences. It is
probably more to blame than full breast plates, although they have
contributed. As to Danulf's problem with folks calling all his blows light,
I say "Vivat, Danulf!" (East Kingdom for "At 'a boy!") Someone with your
experience as a long time club fencer who has his thrusts called light is
doing something right. (I am not joking.)

One comment on 'mundane.'  Either I'm a foggy-minded academic or I
just live in an area where people don't use the word 'mundane' in
a perjorative frame.  I've heard it used but in the context of 'I
need a word to distinguish between the name that one half of my

Or some other case where classification is all there is to it.

   Oak _used_ to be legal in the East Kingdom, among others - it is
no longer allowed.  The reason was that hardwood spears can break
leaving sharp pieces.  In combat terms, the hardwood spears (outlawed
this past year, and not permitted at the past Pennsic) were between
rattan and fiberglass in weight.  Flex was closer to that of fiberglass.

Subject: Non-European Personas

Some time last summer at one of our kingdom-level (An Tir) events, a gentle
showed up dressed in full American Indian gear. He looked impressive.
However, I found his appearance at our event distracting and jolting and
felt very much as I would have if he had been dressed in mundane clothing.
Then I tried to put my finger on WHY I felt that way and I could come up
with no good reason.  I went through the following arguments and I
still don't know if I'd want to allow Non-European personas or not.

(For the sake of argument, I'm going to ignore time periods and
concentrate on geography.)

On the one hand: The Middle Ages (or the years we call "The Middle Ages")
happened all over the world, therefore personas from all over the world
should be allowed.  Side argument: We can learn from these unusual
nationalities. (And learning is GOOD.)

On the other hand: I believe we are trying to re-create a society
(small 's') that reflected the world as it existed during the period
known as The Middle Ages. It is HIGHLY unlikely that my 1446 French
persona would have met/seen an American Indian during her normal lifetime.

On the OTHER hand (watch Elizabeth grow many hands...):
Why do I find Japanese and Mongolian personas acceptable? Because they were
there when I joined the Society (large 'S')?

I believe I would find the appearance of an Incan or African persona just
as distracting as the Indian, but Elizabeth would probably have seen an
African before she saw a Japanese.  Arggg!!

My final thought is this: It occurs to me that we are not discussing
"European vs Non-European" but "Societies (small 's') That Contributed to
the Creation of Western Civilization vs non-whatIjustsaid". Maybe THAT's
what I'm using to decide what I find acceptable.

I dunno if I agree with what I just typed...  Somebody help.

   I have used oak, rattan, and pultruded (my, what a word) spears.  Oak are
sturdy, reasonable weight, and generally between the other two in most aspects.
I have not had oak break on me, but others I know have.  Rattan is unspeakable.
The flex is dangerous, and in order to remove the flex one must either harden
the rattan in some way (I hear these rumors...) or use rattan of approximately
tree weight.  Yech.
   Fiberglass spears are _fast_, light, and of reasonable stiffness.  I under-
stand that they tend to shatter when blocking blows, although this might have
been attributable to standard fiberglass slipping by, if that occurred (just a
guess, you understand).  You can hit like a ton of bricks with them.  If you
adopt them, I STRONGLY suggest reauthorizing people with spear, so that they
can be certain to be used to the speed and power available, and not play
origami with combatant friends.  Also, they shafts available should be better
characterized with respect to shattering.  I would like to know just how big a
problem this is.

   On a slightly different note, what is the terminology here?  I call them
spears, while 'pikes' to me indicates polearms, since they have a chopping
edge.  Anyone elses opinion on this?

Not all cavaliers in the SCA are fencers.  Case in point is the former Earl
Marshall of the Middle, Sir Logos (who wears neat boots too...).  

Just to prod the discussion along:  why was 1600 chosen when the real break
in clothing comes between 1625 and 1650 when the doublet vanishes and is
replaced by the coat?  When armor and jousting disappears about the same
time (and the two events are connected)?

George Silver, the author of "Brief Instructions", a late 16th century
fighting manual, put it quite succinctly:  rapier-fight is intended for
dueling, which is vanity and contrary to good civil government; a gentleman
or gentlewoman (Silver would not have added the latter, but his contemporary
and rival Saviolo did) should only learn those arts of defense that protect
one from death or injury when attacked or which serve the Prince in the wars.

I know this subject has been done to death but I would like to approach
it from a slightly different angle. I am refering to the word Mundane, in
and of it self there is not a lot wrong with it, it is useful for
distinguishing our society of dreamers from the world at large which is
so lacking to most of us. Personally, I do find a lot to dislike in the
"Mundane" world, and things which remind me of it when I am trying to maintain
my persona world view. HOWEVER what I really despise (and is so common in
the mundane world ) is dis-courtesy. When a visitor (who might be dressed
mundanely) comes up and is insulted in any fashion whatsoever then we are
lessened. When petty political bickering can cause people to be disinclined
to join our society, when, in any fashion, we show the lesser sides of
ourselves, then we lose the special spark, the Dream, which makes us special.

Subject: Proposed Rules of the List

I just got my "Fall" TI about a week an a half ago, and among other things
of interest, found that there is a proposal to revise the Rules of the List.
There was a public comment period for people to send their comments to the
Board of Directors, that was to have ended December 1, 1988.  The revised
rules are to be discussed and I guess decided upon at the first quarter
meeting of 1989, which will be (according to the tardy TI) 1/22/89.

Now, since I didn't get the TI until after the December 1 deadline, and
had heard nothing of these proposed changes until then, I'm planning to
figure out what I think and send my thoughts, if any, off to the Society
Marshall and Corporate Secretary post-haste, even if it is after the
deadline.  To help me (and any other fighters out there) figure out just
what I do think about the proposed revision, how about some discussion
here?  As a discussion aid, I'm posting the rules as they were printed in
Tournaments Illuminated.  Note that the BoD has asked for comment - it
probably isn't their fault that the TI was delayed - so let them know
what you think.


                             PROPOSED REVISION
                                   OF THE
                             RULES OF THE LIST

     1.   Each fighter, recognizing the possibility of physical injury
     to himself or herself in such combat, shall assume unto himself or
     herself all risk and liability for harm suffered by means of such
     combat.  Other participants shall likewise recognize the risks
     involved in their presence on or near the field of combat, and
     shall assume unto themselves the liabilities thereof.

     2.   No person shall participate in combat-Related Activities
     unless and until he or she shall have been properly Authorized
     under Society and Kingdom procedures.  In witness whereof, each
     participant shall present a valid Authorization Card tot he
     Sovereign or his or her representative.

     3.   All combatants must be presented to, and acceptable to, the
     Sovereign or his or her representative.

     4.   All combatants shall adhere to the appropriate Armor and
     Weapons standards of the Society, and to any additional standards
     of the Kingdom in which the event takes place.  The Sovereign may
     waive the additional Kingdom standards.

     5.  The Sovereign or the Marshallate may bar any weapon or armour
     from use upon the field of combat.  Should a warranted Marshal bar
     any weapon or armour, an appeal may be made tot he Sovereign to
     allow the weapon or armour.

     6.   Combatants shall behave in a knightly and chivalrous manner,
     and shall fight according to the appropriate Society and Kingdom
     Conventions of Combat.

     7.   No one may be required to participate in Combat-Related
     Activities.  Any combatant may, without dishonor or penalty,
     reject any challenge without specifying a reason.  A fight in a
     Tournament Lists is not to be considered a challenge, and may not
     be summarily declined or rejected.

     8.   Fighting with real weapons, whether fast or slow, is strictly
     forbidden at any Society event.  This Rule does not consider
     approved weaponry which meets the Society and Kingdom standards
     for traditional SCA Combat and/or SCA Period Rapier Combat, used
     in the context of mutual sport, to be real weaponry.

     9.   No projectile weapons shall be allowed and no weapons shall
     be thrown within the Lists of a Tournament.  The use of approved
     projectile weapons for melee, war, or Combat Archery shall confirm
     to appropriate Society and Kingdom Conventions of Combat.

Message-Id: <881212143809.32.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

RE: SCA as an Empire
 
This is an old idea. In a letter dated December 20, 1978 (AS XIII),
Eriod of Eire explained the organization of the Society to me, and
wrote: "Now, for legal reasons, what with being a non-profit corpo-
ration and all, we have a board of directors. This is the National
level of the organization (formerly called the Imperial level, but
they decided that was a bit pretentious I guess)."

If we really wanted to be an Empire (which I'm not sure we do), the
best way to do that should be to let one of the Kings be Emperor.
Which one? It's hardly feasible to gather them and let them fight
about it, for reasons of geography. We might award this honor to
one kingdom at a time, let it circulate. But would it do any good?

Perhaps it might strengthen the feeling of community on the National
level, to know that somewhere there is such an august person.

But these are only ramblings and not my firm opinions. My spontaneous
comment is: forget the Imperial things and let's concentrate on Good
Kingdoms!

RE: Secret Society

A nice idea. But I agree with those who would prefer something other
than "Fishermen" of "Fisherfolk" as the name. Reasons: These words
are associated with being apostles of the Christian Church. Besides,
I *hate* fish!

For a badge, I would suggest that we all get a 3.5 inch microdiskette,
open it and take out the little metal centerpiece. This is a very
anonymous and inconspicuous object to anyone not involved with computers,
but easily recognizable by all who work with them. At least if you have
a 3.5 inch drive.

Fighters who belong to the Secret Group can weld an SCSI outlet on the
back of their helms.

Greetings--

I tried to post this privately to ciula%cis.ohio-state.edu@ohio-state.arpa, 
but couldn't connect, so I figured it might be of interest.  The gentle 
inquired after the reference I made to the heralding (fishy) dolphin, being 
neither the cetacean, nor the crown prince of France...

The fish, dolphin, is a kind of tuna-like beastie that lives in the 
mediterranean.  Websters sez: "2. either of two swift marine fishes with
colors that brighten and change when the fish is taken out of the water" 
I don't know what its heraldic significance is, but I do know it was used as 
part of the signets of one of the academies.

Excuse me for sticking my neck out, but I have always been under the 
impression that such things as rapiers and truck like that were invented for 
the purpose of sticking men in plate armor between the joints and the eye 
holes and other neat places, because overgrown salad forks and pruning hooks 
just weren't effective enough.  

If this is true, then we should definitely allow period fencing with people

Greetings!

While I understand your conceern over posting local announcement,
Justin, I must agree with several people who like seeing the
occasional out-Kingdom announcement.  There is a solution, though:
Distribution! 

If you are posting directly to alt.sca, you can limit the distribution
of a posting by including a line which reads:

Distribution: nj

or something like that.  This line will prevent the message being
passed to any machine outside the state of New Jersey.  Similar
distribution restrictions exist for all sorts of geographical areas.
If you want to post a message of purely local interest, simply limit
the distribution to the area of interest.  Then, Danulf, you can have
the digester ignore anything with a distribution smaller than, perhaps
"alt", "world", "usa" or "na".

Subject: cavalier

	
	M. Litchfield writes:"...Cavaliers and other such swishy-pokes  
(... light-fighters)..."  Mr Litchfield  seems to be using 'cavalier' to mean 
'person fighting SCA-rapier' (Light-list/light weapons refers to a large 
variety of forms including boffers, kendo, and simply not hitting as hard as 
a von holstern.  The only one that has received recoginion as a legitamate 
form in the East is fensing/rapier (to which i will henceforth refer as 
'fencing' because i can pronounce it). 

Fencing is frequently associated with Cavalier personae.  In fact, Mr. 
Lichtfield is far from the only person to speak/write as if fencers and 
cavaliers were synonymous, which they are not. (yet.  Language is a very 
powerfull tool.  Words have meanings and implications far beyond what shows up 
in a dictionary.  Saying something *can* make it true.  This is not magic, it 
just the way people work.)

Carelessly identifiing Cavaliers with fencers is not a good idea. 
(leave asside the fact that it is not fair to those gentles who might wish to 
addopt a cavalier  persona in order to persue such cavalier-era pursuits as 
gunsmithing, newtonian mathematics, and out-of-period lace.)

For one thing, fencing did not begin in the mid 17th century.  We have several 
fencing manuals from the 16th century which is High Rennaissance or 
Elizebethan, not cavalier.  There is no reason that the 'persona' of fencing 
in the sca need be cavalier, and still less that it aught to be.  The only 
physical restrictions on garb are that the upper garment be padded 
canvass-weight material or leather and that the lower garments be of light 
canvas weight at least to the knee.  Thus Elizabethan men's garb is perfectly 
good (in fact, close to ideal *and* there exits excellent documentation for E. 
fensing jackets) and the earlier garb can be made list legal either by wearing 
venitians (~knee breeches, late it. renn.) or by wearing thigh-high boots 
(baron Patri's solution) or by letting authenticity bow to safety and wearing 
mongol pants. 
Nor is there any more reason that fencers should fence in garb that is period 
to fencing  than anyone engage in any sca activity. (e.g., dancing:  we do not 
require that people dance Castille Nouvelle in burgundian garb, Lauro in 
ittalian renn. and the dances from Arbeau in corcets an hoops, and i dont 
think we should (unless, of course we are at a public demo)).  And so should 
fencers fence in what ever period garb suits them and is safe.   (not to 
mention that what the cavalier women were wearing was *ugly, ugly, ugly* and,
 althogh i have seen people  wear it and not look absolutely hideaous, it 
can't be easy)).

Subject: poltruded fiberglass pikes

I had used nothing but rattan pikes before the War, when I was able to
try out these new-fangled plastic gizmos.  I had never had a pike fly
so true in my life.  They went exactly where you put them.  They also 
hit *hard*. {I am very happy to hear of the expanded tip padding
requirement for these pikes. I think that's necessary}  These pikes were 
lighter than any other weapon I'd wielded, too.   In the West Kingdom, 
nothing but rattan may be used to build pikes (or any other weapon, for
that matter).  Frankly, I get shivers down my spine when I think of 
using hardwood to build weapons.  I'm not even jumping up and down to
get the fiberglass pikes approved out here.  I can think of several
pikemen whom I would not want hitting me with those things in battle.  
The safety of rattan comes from its flex, and IMHO, pikes that don't
flex aren't safe.  Let me qualify that a bit.  The Eastrealm does not
allow face-thrusts, and that eliminates a big part of the danger.  I
don't worry much, as I have a full steel chestplate, and hard thrusts
to the solar plexus will stagger me backward enough to judge the blow, 
but I'll still be able to breathe when I fall down.  I personally don't
want to take a shot to the diaphragm from a non-flexible weapon while
wearing anything less, however.  I didn't know that oak was legal
anywhere.  Would the marshalls have passed them for use at Pennsic?

As for the List rules: I haven't been able to reach Duke Erin, but I
called Mistress Cliveden, the Corporate Secretary, today. As far as
her deadlines go (needing to get things to the BOD members to see),
the comments could come in as late as 1 January. I'll try to contact
Duke Erin tonight to see what his timeline is.
 
Please, if you make comments here on line, please also send them in.
This is a very important decision, and needs much comment from a

Hello...

In relation to the secret society...
The solution for the password problem is
for everyone to have their own and keep 
it secret. Personally I am keeping mine
secret from myself....

About Cavaliers: We see a lot of them
being as close to Austin as we are. Austin
seems to be the capital of Cavaliers. They
are like any other sub-group in the SCA. Some
good, some I don't agree with. Speaking as
a fairly experienced heavy weapons fighter
though their top fighters impress me greatly.
Don't let anyone kid you that swash is for
people who can't fight heavy ( a sentiment

of crossover between the two styles.
Whether period fencing belongs in a society
built upon the premise of the European knight in armor
is a question I haven't answered for myself yet.
Has anyone else ever heard this argument before??

No, this isn't about the "Secret Society" debate (although that argument does
warm the SubGenius in my soul); it's about a few of the messages that have
been appearing lately.

People, please try to avoid posting local messages to this list. The volume
of this group is substantial enough as is (I know a couple of people who have
dropped off due to the volume). If people keep posting local event 
announcements, messages to their local groups, or whatever, it's going to
get overwhelming. Remember that even a kingdom-level event announcement is
only going to concern a fraction of the people here.

I'm not trying to single out any particular note as offensive (although I'm
a little distressed that most of the notes that concern me have come from
Carolingia), and it hasn't been much of a problem yet, but there does seem
to be an increase in the number of these messages lately. Just be aware 
that this could become a problem, and don't contribute to it. Thanks.

Hello,

Myrkfaelinn took a number of fiberglass spears to the war.  Though they were
nice to fight with, we had a number of them break.  I also heard a few fellow
fighters discussing how it was taking time to get used to the flex in them.
A surgical thrust to the midsection quite often turned into a cup shot.  I
can't speak for the entire group, but I suspect that given a choice, most of
our fighters would reach for the oak before the fiberglass at practice.

Indeed.  This is probably the most commonly advanced & most telling

I'd like to respond the Lord Justin de Coeur's request that we not
post any event announcements to the net. I can see not posting
announcements of tiny events, but I'd protest over a restriction for
larger Kingdom events.
 
Diversity is a joy of the SCA, and I'd like to encourage people to
go to events in different Kingdoms if at all possible. I see all the
Kingdom newsletters and all the announcements, and this hass
encouraged me to do some wider traveling, and I feel it has been
very good for me. Some of the Interkingdom squabbles that develop
have more to do with regional differences, or perceived regional
differences, than they do with actual animosity, and travel and
exchange is a good way to discover the similarities and differences
in us all, so we can understand each other.
 
Please, let's encourage each other to grow via this medium.

Justin du Coeur posted a request that people stop posting
local event notices. I'd like to comment.

I don't mind reading event copy about a large event at which it
is reasonable to expect out-of-kingdom visitors. (Even if
I don't expect to be able to attend.) I like to see what
kinds of things happen at eastern-type kingdom events,
eg. arts and sciences competitions, banquet menus, timetables
and the like.

I DO mind reading event copy from the Shire of Ne'er-Do-Well

isn't a listed in the kingdom newsletter.

I am stridently in favor of non-european personas. They make an event much
more enjoyable. It has been my experiance that newcomers tend to adopt (or
be forced into) either Celtic or Norse personas (usually for several reasons,
simple garb, garb which somewhat aproximates mundane clothing so they feel
more comfortable, simplicity of persona....allin all its just easier), but
after they gain experiance they tend to branch out and change into more
original and unique personas. Limiting to Post-Roman Europeans (as I have
heard mentioned) would close off so  many options.

Excuse me M'lord, but are you sure? I had been given to understand that
both Christian and pagan versions of this song go back a long way.
I have
seen several collections of filk songs attributing it to anonymous or
traditional,
and I have seen many, many new verses of it.  Check out the "Westerfilk I
hymnal" from Off Centaur inc. and "Filker-Up" by Lee and Barry Gold.

Subject: 'Mundanes', group personae
Message-Id: <6698@pucc.Princeton.EDU>

A few probably out of date thoughts regarding the recent debate among the
Fisher-folk (and casting my vote for how to refer to this Secrete
Society thing as well).
 
1) The term 'mundane' is rooted in SF fandom, and refers to anyone not
part of the group.  It's origonal purpose is to indicate that what
goes on in the 'real world' is not normal, with the implication that
what we fo is weird, different, and therefore wrong, but mundane,
and therefore boring.  I like the term, but agree that too many people
get caught up in the negative aspects and become contemptous  of those not
part of the 'in' group. (This danger arises from any kind of group and is
not unique to Fandom or SCA.)  Creating a new term would not help, people
would just use the new term in the same manner as they use 'mundane' now.
I think the best way to solve the problem is to be as friendly as possible
to newcommers, criticize those who go out of their way to exclude first-
timers, and reserve our scorn for those who regard us as children or
simpletons. (At Philcon one individual wanted to know what I 'got' out
of fandom, and if it wasn't money why on Earth did I dress up so
ridiculously.  This person is a 'Mundane.'
 
Group personae can be fun when they work out, but should not be
limiting.  My persona is 11th century.  I formed household with
someone else from 11th century Spain.  We thought this worked out
pretty well.  When a friend of mine wanted a temporary persona for
one event, I made up one for him that jibed with our house history.
However, when we wanted to include a friend with a persona from
13th century Ireland, we didn't worry about it 'not fitting' with our
group persona.

I musty admit that when I first heard of cavaliers and other such Swishy-pokes
(Ansteaorran perjorative for light fighters) I was rather against such things.
But I have been impressed by several people here who are very into that
sort of thing, and since many time Heavy Combat seems to be nothing but
battle of the tanks, with "stick-jocks" who dont care a whit for anything
BUT fighting, while the Swishy's tend to at least nod in the direction of
things besides fighting. Besides they have some really neat boots.

The solution to the password problem is very simple.  I have just picked
the password.  Now, since I'm just an interested mundane who doesn't
actually participate in SCA activities (maybe someday...), you won't run
into me at an SCA event, and since the password is secret, I'm not going
to tell anybody what it is!  Problem solved.

It seems to me that the best way to keep a "secret" society secret
is not to name it! 

A simple piece of netting hung from the belt will adequately identify
any net-type person to any other. 

The beauty of this plan is that the best way to keep the name a
secret is for absolutely *no one* to know what it is.....

And the passwords should be kept absolutely secret as well. 

I shouldn't even be telling you this now.....

Actually, their complaints had a good deal of legitimacy: The
landlords counted those 11 days, and charged rent for them.  Of

Greetings to all fellow netfolk,

  I have been reading this group for a long time in silence.  I just
thought I'd add my 2 pennys to the pool.  I really like the idea of 
a secret society, and using a piece of netting as a recognition symbol 
sounds like a good idea.  I don't think that we need a very complex 
name, and if we need one at all, FisherFolk sounds better than many of
the others suggested.  

  However, I agree with Lord Danulf that we should go back to discussing
more interesting and relevant topics now.  This particular subject is
beginning to wear a bit thin.  Especially since everybody (yes, including
myself in the first paragraph) is saying the same thing.  Just my 2
pennys :-) .

The pultruded fiberglass pikes, according to reports, worked very well at
Pennsic XVII.  Every expert spearwoman/man who had a chance to use one went
out and got one immediately (that I know personally).  At the lengths that
we allow at Pennsic (9 foot) they are very accurate.  The only complaint was
that they are harder hitting than rattan shafts; this led to a change to 3"
thrusting tips (a Society standard).  

The major question is a weapons inspection question; some suppliers mixed 
pultruded and standard shafts in the lots they sold.  A marshall must actually
see and feel the shaft if he/she is to reliably check the type.  The test is to
try and break the shaft with a severe bend (45 degrees or more);a good pultruded
shaft will not break.
