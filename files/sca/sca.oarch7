Winding springs is fine, but that's exactly what they are, springs!
I think it was even stated that the winding springs would "look
like screen door springs."  OK, go to your hardware store, and buy
screen door springs. That are about 4 different "standard" springs, pick
one that looks suitable. This is a expensive way of getting rings, but it
works.  I once thought there has to be a spring company that would make
a "perfect" spring that had a considerable length (since you have the
range: watch springs to garage door springs), but never persued it.
Anybody tried finding a source? If so, please post!

Oh, one other thing: Making chainmail is so boring that it makes sewing
seem tremendously exciting! (personal observation :-)

Yup.  I side with William de Corbie on this.  We've had the ethnologists
poking around pretty vigorously the last century or two and "lost religious"
colonies now fall in the same category as "lost civilizations. (Ever notice
that they're always placed in the largest poorly-explored region available?
Edgar Rice Burroughs used central Africa.  In the '30s, the Amazon rain
forest was popular.)

Is what you propose possible?  Of course . . .  Is it likely?  No.  As
it now stands all such claims are suspect and to be examined carefully.
*Any* inconsistencies will be taken for evidence of fakery.  Is this 
fair? No--but it is prudent when dealing with far fetched claims.
Personnaly--I'd be *delighted* if such claims were true--but that just 
means I have to be extra careful when examining them.

When was the last time you heard of someone being "killed for their
beliefs" in a western country?  (Hint--try the Civil Rights Movement.)
On the other hand--no one doubted what those beliefs were--*and* it
wasn't just because the beliefs were held.  The reality is that so long
as you don't bug the neighbors too much you can (literally) get away
with murder for an extended period of time.  Anything less, and you
can find an area that will merely consider you 'excentric'.  It is
very hard to believe that any community--religous or not--will not 
have been noticed by *somebody* and their beliefs will be studied.

Since you can--in some sense--measure a belief system (that is--you can
get scholarly papers published about it), it is *not* at all probable
that such a community would be unknown.  Note here that you are claiming
a scientific bent and you know about them?  Why not publish and become
famous?  You will risk ridiclue if you are wrong, though.

Subject:  more religion (sorry, gentles)

Greetings, milords and ladies.  Just a short piece today...

Someone (sorry, I missed your name) responded to William de Corbie's posting
about neo-Paganism, etc., with words resembling "all period _nobility_ were
practicing and believing Roman Catholics."  I beg your pardon, but the most
you can demonstrate to me of the above is practicing and publicly appearing
to believe.  Persecuted groups go underground when necessary, and Pagans
of the period would not (IMHO) have given up their position of nobility
without a fight.  As has been said many times, Polytheism accepts Monotheism,
Monotheism doesn't accept Polytheism.  Therefore, they could even have
been believers to the extent that the Christian God was one of their pantheon,
but I find it very hard to believe that they were *all* strictly Catholic
believers.

Re:  Chainmail from springs (bought commercially):

If I remember correctly,  Sir William the Lucky made his chainmail
from commercially produced springs.  However, he special ordered
springs of "length one".  i.e. he didn't have to cut anything, they
were already a "circle".

I believe in the discussion with him, that we decided  "1 1/8"
length springs would be better.  i.e. a small amount of overlap,
similiar to the cheap rings used to hold keys.  (This may have been
how his chainmail was constructed, as opposed to theory, I will ask
him this weekend, if he is at March Crown.)

Since his "rings" were made out of spring steel, they want to stay
closed, not open up.  I will check if I see him.

Reminds me of a story from the Shire of Dragon's Laire, in An Tir. We
desired possession of another town on the border between us and a nearby
barony. The baron informed us that he would grant our desire in return for
his weight in chocolate chip cookies (the baron was, and is, a sizable man).
At the Lord Defender's tourney, we, during the closing feast, interrupted
the ceremony by a procession of us, in line, bringing in more and more
cookies, at first tiny, but getting progressively larger with each person
that came before the baron. Eventually, two of the strongest men in our shire
came out, apparently struggling under the weight of something hideously heavy
on a large board. It finally reached the baron and a blanket covering the
burden was removed, revealing ... "250+ lbs." written in cookies.
We were granted the town. And, I assume, the baron became even larger.

I think what would be more accurate is that your religion is descended in
a direct line from the Christianity of the Middle Ages. However, early
Christianity, through the Middle Ages, was still combining elements of
the pagan religions. For example, I have a twelfth-century prayer, 
translated by a friend of mine who is a professor of Old English, 
which was said on the summer solstice. The priest saying the prayer
would alternately call on the Earth Mother and Mary, the Sun and the
Christian God, and the sky/clouds and Heaven. The rituals of the prayer
include the "Our Father" said the mystical three times three times,
and at the height of the prayer, the priest calls (three times) upon
Erce, Goddess of Earth/Mother of God. I doubt that any modern Christian
would recognize such a prayer as part of his or her faith, yet such
prayers were considered a normal part of Christianity in the Middle
Ages.

	That's me -- and I rather agree with your thesis -- for about 2
generations.  For a tradition or religion to survive, it must be _taught_, it
must be performed _publicly_, and it must be _accepted_ (at least by its
adherents).

	The concept of privacy (either personal or family) did not exist before
the invention of chimneys late in our period, and did not catch on until the
late Rennaisance.  There was literally nowhere in the mediaeval household
where you were not under scrutiny.  "Teaching secret doctrines" was thus next
to impossible -- _somebody_ would be listening, and likely tattling.
	After the Albigensian crusade, no noble could chance being caught teaching
his or her children anything but the pure quill christianity -- and maybe not
that, considering the state of literacy of the Inquisition.  His greedy
neighbor would cheerfully denounce him to whatever heretic-hunter was handy,
and equally cheerfully grab his assetts when he got burnt/beheaded/stomped.

	Religious ritual is learned by _seeing_, _doing_, and _remembering_ --
very damned few people in that age were literate, and 99-44/100ths % of them
were Christian clerics.  Without practice, rituals and beliefs disappear in a
maximum of two generations.
	What religion were your grandparents (both sides)?  Where did they go to
church? what were their favorite hymns/songs?  How 'bout your 8
great-grandparents?  
	If you're like the average American, you may or may not even know their 
_names_, much less this level of detail about them.  My paternal
great-grandfather (of the same name) was a rather large frog in a small puddle
in the Midwest (Shelton, Nebraska), and his childrenand grandchildren were
much in awe of him.  Aside from his writings, which I inherited, I know about
4 or 5 stories about him.  _His_ father, who was only marginally literate,
survives in this generation only in 1 story.  Before that, there are only
names -- mostly courtesy of the Mormon Church's genealogical work.

	What you do must be _supported_ and _encouraged_ by the community around
you to survive.  Modern Afro-Americans are overwhelmingly Baptist, _NOT_
worshippers of Papa Legba, Baron Samedi, and the other adaptations of Yoruba
cult figures.  Voudun survives in areas where there is (and has been
_continuous_) ongoing contact with communitied which practice that faith.
	Amongst "Native Americans", the only groups to preserve their traditional
religions have been the ones which also preserved their cultures -- Navaho,
Hopi, Pueblo, and a few others.  The oldest remembered songs amongst the Sioux
are christian hymns -- Black Elk's successor as vision-holder of the Cheyenne
nation is a South Dakotan of German parentage.

	Religion is not just a set of beliefs and ideas, it is a _culture_ --
Roman Catholics who were born and grew up before Vatican II were and are
_culturally_ quite distinct from the Episcopalians, Methodists, and Baptists
who live(d) across the street.  This is changing now, since Roman Catholicism
(at least in the U.S.) hasopted to adapt to the prevailing culture -- in
another generation, the differences will be minute.
	My mother's mother's parents emigrated from Germany (Prussia and Bavaria,
respectively) in the 1870's or so.  My grandmother, who was born in 1892,
spoke a little German and understood a lot.  My mother had four or five
phrases.  If I had nothad German in high school and college, I would have
maybe two -- my cousins have none.

	Scientists can be arrogant, yes -- but it is mostly the third-rate minds
that make dogmatic statements about the utter impossibility of
something-or-other;  second rate minds are careful about their terminology;
first-rate scientists are curious about damned near everything, and willing to
hear more.  History, Sociology, and Ethnology aren't sciences in the same
sense that Physics, Chemistry and Astrophysics are -- they are descriptive,
not predictive, and have no "hard" numbers associated with them.  Neither are
they practical, like engineering.
	In most European languages, however, there is no distinction made between
"hard" science and "soft" science, as we are beginning to do in English -- any
organized body of knowledge is called "Science" (that's what the Latin root
means -- "Knowldege" of any type).  I suspect that is the sense in wheich
William is using the word, not the more restrictive and predictive sense we
would . . .

Subject:  Children; Event fees; $ for art; Religion; New _Corpora_

Greetings!

Well, good gentles, I've been busy lately, but now it's time to catch up.

You have been warned...  :-)

CHILDREN:  I've been greatly enjoying the discussion on children, because the
topic has been sorely neglected.  I wholeheartedly support all the positive
comments and suggestions regarding the presence of children in the SCA.  After
all, they're our most "renewable resource!"  :-)

Before adding my own comments and suggestions, however, I must add one
"problem scenario" which seems to have been overlooked.  Namely, that of the
child who has no interest in his/her parents' Game.  This happened here in
Trimaris some years ago.  A lady who was the single parent of a 10 year-old
boy (give or take a year or two) joined the SCA.  She was very active and a
hard worker, and soon became a leadership figure.  Her son, however, had no
interest whatsoever in the SCA.  When brought to events (his mother
occassionally had no choice) he often refused to wear garb, and since he
didn't want to be where he was, was bored, and knew he was stuck with the
situation, he spent a great deal of time being disruptive and obnoxious.  As
time passed, the boy settled down.  But, until then he was *awfully* trying!

It seems to me that we cannot emphasize enough that parents' are responsible
for their offsprings' welfare!  As recent postings have evidenced, most
parents realize this and make suitable arrangements.  However, in those cases
where there are repeated problems with the same family, it might be well to
remember that reservations need not be accepted and troublemakers can be asked
to leave a site.  This sounds heavy-handed, I know, but sometimes it's the
only way.  And there is also the liability of the Society to consider:  here
in Trimaris many of the campgrounds we use regularly have lakes, and
unattended children playing about the water are a perennial problem.  Think
about it.

On the positive side:  we have a Pages' Guild, and House Hobbyhorse.  Co-
operative baby-sitting is organized through these agencies.  There are classes
and activities for children.  Children love to be included:  just this past
weekend at Coronation I taught simple Heraldry to a bunch of small ones.  I
used a felt board and felt cut-out pieces to illustrate the tinctures and
charges (a device I heartily recommend to others!)  By the time I was ready to
depart the site 2 hours later, 2 young ladies of approximately 7 years of age
had their device submission forms filled out, and they asked me to check their
proposed devices!

One maneuver that was an unqualified success (and a delight to watch) was a
project class wherein the children made gifts for the Royalty, which they
presented as a group at Court that evening.  Near as I could tell, not one
pair of small feet touched the ground as they recessed!

Children also make excellent servers and go-fers, and usually enjoy it.

Trimaris has an award for children who make substantial/outstanding
contributions on their own.  Also, any child may make entries into any Arts/
Sci category at the semi-Annual Kingdom A/S Faires.  They may enter *as a
child* and the judges will make allowances accordingly, or as an adult.
Children *need* recognition, praise, and to be included just as much as they
need affection and discipline.

And SCA children tend to turn out a damn sight better than most!

SITE FEES:  *Everyone* in Trimaris is expected to pay their event fees, fair
and square.  Autocrats may choose to waive fees for the Royalty in order to
help ease the financial burden of Their Reign (and almost invariably do), but
the Royalty are not _de_facto_ entitled to attend events _gratis_.  Autocrats
have also been known to be willing to trade labor for a reduced event fee, for
those who are in financial distress.  Also, it is a common practice in
Trimaris to charge more for non-members to attend.

CHARGING MONEY FOR ART:  I think that all of the commentary on this topic can
be summed up as follows:  it depends on the situation at hand.  Certainly,
charging (or attempts to charge) for work done on a volunteer basis will be
met with ill humor and disapproval anywhere.  On the other hand, nothing is
wrong with requesting fair remuneration for work rendered upon request on a
private basis (pre-arranged).  Or bartering, for that matter.  (**WHERE**
would the SCA be without bartering?)  And, I don't think it's *ever* wrong to
request reimbursement for monies spent on materials, except where it has been
agreed that the materials are being volunteered along with the labor.

This whole discussion has brought to mind an adjacent topic recently discussed
down here:  should an individual who pursues his/her craft professionally not
be considered for awards relating to that craft, or should the ability to make
a living from one's craft be considered as being the ultimate test of one's
craftsmanship?

Let me illustrate:  there *are* professional calligraphers/illuminators.
If one of these gentles were to be considered for the Order of the Laurel,
should it *not* include their professional abilities as a basis for
consideration?  Or, should the fact that they can successfully earn a living
by their craftsmanship be seen as the best proof of their ability?

Despite much thought, I find myself somewhat torn here.  On the one hand, I
lean towards the latter attitude (best test).  On the other, I think of all
the time spent on the craft on a daily basis by a professional, which keeps up
the levels of ablility.  This is as opposed to most of us, who struggle to
find the time to gain and perfect our abilities in some craft.  For now, I am
taking the "best test" stance, as to me it allows the greatest benefit of
doubt.

RELIGION:  I have already noted in a previous posting some of the reasons why
we need to take care regarding religious displays in the Society, and also
that there is neither reason nor need to stop private ceremonies (or the
announcement thereof).  Many have well noted the need for tolerance.  At this
time, I would note that the draft of the new _Corpora_ clearly defines (and in
some respects re-defines) and explains the Corporation's official stand
regarding religion.  As the verbiage is far clearer than the old _Corpora_, I
strongly recommend that those who have been following the discussions on this
topic read this draft.

AND SPEAKING OF THE DRAFT OF THE NEW _CORPORA_:  I received mine a couple of
weeks ago, and plan to write a letter of comment shortly.  I also plan to post
the gist of my letter as a spur to discussion.  The revision of _Corpora_ will
affect each and every one of us directly for a long time to come.  I think it
behooves us to spend some time discussing it:  who knows, we just might come
up with something so scathingly brilliant the BoD will *have* to adopt it! :-)

First-time poster; I hope this works...

No one has mentioned a technique that some of the chainmail-makers
in our kingdom have come up with.  The trick is to have a projection
instead of a hole in the winding bar to hook the wire onto at the
beginning.  Start from the MIDDLE of the wire, bend it in half, and
loop the wire over the projection.  Then wind the double spring, putting
two strands of wire on simultaneously.  The advantage of this is that,
when you cut the spring to make links, the links are already open and
don't need to be spread.  (Use normal springs for making closed rings.)
I think Manfred Kriegstrieber was the one who came up with this, but I'm
not sure.

Greetings Milord, 

     Yes, some get paid, some don't.  And, it seems to me that those who
get paid don't seem to "get their Laurels" quite as easily as those who
don't get paid.  The difference here, I think, is - who is "in service
to the dream" and who is not.  I don't think there is anything wrong with
getting paid for your work, whether you're teaching {dance, armour, 
calligraphy, cooking, etc.} or just performing a service.  Albiet, you should
inform someone of your expectations prior to performing that service. 
But, those who "work for free" are often acknowledged by a Laurel more
readily.... those who charge are more often "merchants" and I have yet
to see a merchant given a Laurel unless there has been a great deal 
of "doing it for free", or the work is particularly spectacular. (In
which case that is often "gifted" to the Kingdom...)

Milord de Corbie - 
   This is the one thing I would think you would most empathize with.  Just
because "no such thing is known to science" does that mean it doesn't 
exist? ("God" is unknown to science as well!)  Why do you find it so 
difficult that a persecuted religion *survived* by being handed down by
word of mouth through family traditions?  Granted, most pagan groups today
are formed by "rediscovered" or "created" methods.  Most can't trace their
roots back more than oh, 75-100 years or so.  Not what we would call 
an Old religion (as religions go :-). If a people are persecuted, and
they are greatly in the minority, they hide.  Sometimes better than
you might imagine!  I have found several people who are pagans that 
you would never think... a few are avid "Church goers" and these people
have social and financial ties that would be removed if it was found
out that they were pagan.  Throughout history, pagans have been out-and-out
killed by others for their beliefs.  Is it so hard to believe that "science"
would know *nothing* about these folks?  I am computer system admin at
the company I work for.  I'd like to think I know a bit of science, but
"science" as a community is arrogantly ignorant.  If they can't "prove it"
ie, touch, taste, smell, hear, or in some way measure it, it doesn't exist.
As a song once said -

        " The boy from the country, said the animals could speak
          how do you know they don't? Just because they've never
            spoken to you?...." - J. Denver, "Boy from the Country"

My regrets, Milord, I seem to have inadvertantly stumbled onto a soapbox. 
I believe you can see my point, though... science has a lot yet to learn
about people.  As well as this Emerald Ord we affectionately call home.

I saw an article in some SCA publication--no idea what it was--
but it suggested that when wrapping coils to make rings, if you
wrap two wires at a time--next to each other--and cut them 
together, you will have open rings and not have to pry each ring
open after cutting.  Obviously you'd have to do a second coil
for closed rings and press them together--but it might speed up
the work a bit.

Subject: Re: Money for Art
Message-Id: <934@lts.UUCP>

Hmm.  I've argued both sides of this issue, because I think that
whether charging money is appropriate or not depends on the situation.
My basic rule of thumb is that I don't think it's appropriate for
an artist to charge for something that I view as a service to the
Society.  For example:

    A scribe doing kingdom award scrolls
    A musician perfoming as entertainment at an event
    A costumer doing fancy coronation garb
    A cook planning the menu and supervising the cooking for a feast
    A squire helping to provide security at a camping event
    ... and so on.

Part of what keeps the Society going is that we all give of our own talents
and strengths, receive of other peoples'.  I may be a pathetic dancer, but
I do get a kick out of helping provide live music for other people to dance
to; everybody wins.

Then again, I have no problem with people charging money for *private
commissions*.  If a fighter wants a chainmail shirt, and their local
armourer can make one, but only if he or she can get reimbursed the
time involved, that's fine.  Likewise, if someone gets knighted (or
otherwise peered :-)), and knows a scribe that can do a scroll in their
favorite style on real vellum with gold leaf, but couldn't afford the
time unless they got some money for it, that's OK too.  For that matter,
I don't even have a problem with outright merchanting, such as selling
tapes/celtic stationery/armour/whatever at the War.

These things are all in addition to the normal functioning of the Society,
though.  If someone says, "yeah, I'll work on backlogged scrolls, but
only if you make it worth my while," I think there missing a big point.
Maybe even *the* big point...

Does this make sense?

I agree that it is illogical. Here is my story. I have been interested in
yarn crafts for a very long time. About a year and a half ago, I acquired an
inkle loom. I started making belts for my own entertainment. A number of
folk saw me doing this, an inkle loom is very portable, and some asked to
buy or commission belts. What am I supposed to do? (Actually, I agreed and
am left with question of price).

The issue now breaks down into
	1. I am more interested in new designs than repeating old designs.
	2. The populace has very little imagination.
	3. I need money for new and better materials.
	4. Once a piece has served its purpose, I have little interest
	   in keeping it (I have more THINGS than I have places to keep
	   them already).
	5. Minimum wage rules would price my work out of sight. Minimum
	   wage is $3.75 per hour. My current style and choice of materials
	   limits progress to about 4" per hour. The looms generate belts
	   of 80" to 100". Thus a belt should cost about $75 for labour
	   plus $5 for materials. On the other hand, since this is clearly
	   skilled labour, the rate should be $10 to $15 per hour pushing
	   the price up to the $200 mark.

If I am lucky, I can find someone who will pay me $40 for such a belt. This
means that I am totally ignoring the production cost. The price paid is the
balance between my desire to keep something pretty and my need for money.
My rule of thumb for pricing is material cost plus $1.50 per hour of labour.

This rationale can be applied to any material object, even scrolls. However,
with scrolls, it is the group that commissions them and therefore the group

should pay for them.

Subject:  Religion 

I recently received almost an entire month of this digest which I got to read
in a single evening. (An inch thick stack!) I was captivated by the discussion
on religion because it is paralleled by the discussions my acquaintances have
been having recently. I was especially impressed by the comments from Awilda
Halfdane and Samuel Bassett.
 
I have noted a growing persecution of those interested in religion in the SCA.
Especially, I have noted that there have been a number of people who have
objected to having Catholic activities (Sunday morning lay services) taking
place. (My pagan friends say that they have run into similar problems.)
 
Most of the time these activities are very quiet (the exception being one time
about four years ago when a bell was rung at 8 AM. I agree that that was out of
line.) Now we are not allowed to announce them in ANY way (inluding posting a
notice on a bulletin board). This means that the activities have become so quiet
that most of the time I can't find them. (We try to use word of mouth, but that
means remembering every person who might have an interest and finding them at
very large camping sites.)
 
I've wondered about why this has happened. I feel like it is probably backlash
from those who have been persecuted in the past. However, my pagan friends are
actually supportive of our services. Perhaps it is a reaction to those perceived
as being in charge. (I've also noticed that people seem to lash out at anyone
who seems to have power- real or perceived.)
 
What I would not like to see is ANY religion be put forward as official in any
way. Neither do I like to see the insistance that religion be totally invisible
as if it did not exist at all. I feel that more should be done so as to further
EDUCATE people.
 
I become very concerned when I hear that someone has become offended because
they HEARD some part of a Christian ritual or SAW a Thor's hammer (or whatever).
Offense-taking seems to me to be INTOLERANCE and other things which I thought
were the "bad things" from the middle ages that we are supposed to try to
avoid.
 
I also see that the perception of those outside the SCA is that we are a
"Middle Evil" group (as opposed to a group which studies medieval culture and
history) or a group of atheist/pagans starting their own "religion". (Don't
laugh. This is what I picked up from my very non-SCA mother and some of her
friends. They were VERY serious about this. Unfortunately, people like this can
have a BIG impact on our non-profit standing because not all of them are
crackpots.) I feel that this kind of attitude stems from the public's lack of
education. However, part of it is also because of the emphatic removal of
accoutrements of Christian religion from a time when it was very much in
evidence. The more we try to show we are NON-religious, the more ANTI-religious
we appear.

Subject: Public vs.Private "honor," and Winning.

I was recently asked to judge the chivalry during a "Bearmeat" (unbelted
tourney. (A contest "known" to the combatants.) We (the ladies who were
judging) watched for such things as courtesy to their opponents (not gloating
when they won, nor sulking when they lost, helping them up, etc.), sincerity
(the old "I'm better than you so I can afford to drop my shield" vs. "I drop my
shield so that we will continue to be evenly matched" argument came up here),
and behavior on the field (apparent rhinohiding being right out). It was tough
to judge (although there was a *clear* choice by the end of the tourney).
 
The most difficult part about judging this contest was deciding what we were
going to watch because we all had different ideas about what chivalry was.
Chivalry, courtesy and honor are difficult concepts even within a group such as
ours which is devoted to those concepts. I think that is because the definition
changes with what place and timeperiod you're studying. What actually occurred
in period and what the highest ideals are radically different. There may be
similarities between the Viking era, the time of the crusades, medieval Japan
and what the SCA has evolved, but there are also differences. It is those
differences that will be material for controversy for times to come.

Greetings from Hal Ravn:

This is going to look like it is rambling a bit from the subject at hand,
but please bear with me as I think it a relates together.

I have a general suspicion of organizations that mean to do good and become
financially rewarding to those running the organization in the process.  
I think this should--to some degree--apply also to those who find that they
can make a living supplying the needs and wants of such organizations as well.
On the other hand--it is also a truism that "the workman is worthy of his
hire."  The problem is to resolve these mutually contradictory positions.

Consider, on the one hand, a Society member that finds he has a talent for
making armor.  He finds this skill sufficient to actually attempt to make a
living doing so.  Clearly, to ask him to supply his labor--let alone materials--
gratis is asking too much.  As a result, professional armorers are accepted
in the Society.  This is true even more when one considers that there is
no substitute in the Society for good armor and there is--essentially--no
demand for it outside.  (This later is not *quite* true.  The armorer I have
in mind is now filling a nice little contract for helms for display.  Get
a copy of the March '89 catalog from "The Sharper Image."  The helms they're
selling are made by a couple of our people . . .)

Second item.  I do a certain amount of woodworking.  It's not really fancy,
but it looks period--some of it spectacularly so--and it's functional and
portable.  I have bed that I use sometimes at tourneys that is done to the
general look of the ship shelter bed from the Viking ship finds.  (Go look
in "The Vikings" from Tre Trykere (sp?).)  The Kingdom of the West is even
now working to replace the thrones I built about 15 years ago.  I do not
expect to be paid for such work--the thrones were a gift (unasked for) from
me and my Lady to the Kingdom.  I am willing to teach what I know--and have
done so.  Not only do I have an internal requirement to do so, but it furthers
the purpose of the Society (nonprofit *Educational* organization) and it's
flattering besides.

I think the dividing line runs where there is an external market that will
bear the cost of hand labor.  Where one Lady has noted that she makes lace--
and the market will *not* bear the cost of the labor, I spin (labor alone
alone would make wool yarn cost over $50 per pound (1 pound (lb) = 2.2 Kg).
There is very little market for these products outside either barter or
labor of love.  The rewards are effectively all psychological.  Where there
is no commercial and affordable product, then those of us that do not have
the skill to produce the product will have to either barter something of
equal or greater value--*to*the*craftsman*--or flat out pay for it.

I do not run down the skills of those whose talents have them doing something
that has no external market--just note that there isn't one.  The joy and
the curse of our interests is that we are preserving and re-discovering
crafts that might otherwise have been lost for good.  The calligraphers 
are probably the most noticable.  They do absolutely beautiful work.  It
has been improving for over twenty years as each suceeding artist (and artists
they are) tries to do better than anyone else.  The most we can really
offer for these exquisite works is some compensation for materials.  We
simply *cannot* afford to properly pay for the amount of work that is put
into many scrolls--unless the number of recipients is cut to what the 
Society (or the recipient) can afford.  That way lies disaster for the
Society as we know it.

If the Society were to pay--fairly--for the work done, the entire organization
would have to be run for the benefit of a small group at the top.  It would
have a truly medieval character--while it lasted.  If there were a small
leading group that got all the goodies and convinced everyone else to work
for peanuts, we would have to worst version of the cults that have sprung up
in recent years.  If we don't pay--we rely on volunteer labor and sheer
enthusiasm.  In the long run--the later is the healthier course to run.

Message-Id: <1636@amelia.nas.nasa.gov>


	{ This discussion might just fit better in talk.religion.misc than
here -- but on the other hand, this is _alt_.sca }

	I am going to have to agree with milord de Corbie (interesting name,
in that the battle standard of several Scandinavian invaders of England
was the raven . . .) that no historical trace of organized pagan religion
in Europe can be found after the 17th Century.
	The "Old Religion" in Europe is Catholicism.  The last pagans in
England were converted to Protestantism/Puritanism in the middle 1600s.
the last pagan enclave in France was converted to Catholicism in the late
1600s or early 1700s (an island off the coast of Brittany).  The last
authentic Prussian pagans were destroyed by the Teutonic Knights in the
early 1600s or before, and Slavic paganism had succumbed into folklore by
the time of Peter the Great.
	That there are pagan survivals in folk customs -- Morris dances,
sacred wells, maypole dances, curses, songs and stories -- does not alter
the fact that paganism as a living culture effectively died with the rise
of the modern nation-state, at exactly the time that the Society's period
ends.

	No modern, neo-pagan group can trace its origins back farther than
Gerald Gardiner -- to the 1950s.  Masons, various sorts of occultists,
and 'satanists' of various stripes can trace their origins to the court
of the Sun King -- Louis XIV (mid-1600s).  Alchemists and ceremonial
magicians trace their heritage to late Classical times, with fair
accuracy (see Jung's writing on gnosticism and alchemy).
	This branch of metaphysics mostly died out in the late 1700s,
however, when Lavoisier & Co. established the Scientific Enlightenment.

	Every branch of convinced European and American occultism/paganism
was founded in the last century and a half, either as a consequence of
Victorian romanticism (Eliphas Levy in the France of the 1860s; the
Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in England of the 1890s), or as a
reaction to the sterility of post-WWII rationalism and ecological havoc.
	No modern American paganism among people of European descent goes
much farther back than the publication of Robert Heinlein's "Stranger in
a Strange Land" in 1963-64 (Church of All Worlds).  English Gardnerians
(Alexandrians are a branch of the Gardnerians) go back to the 1950s -- 
most of the original coveners are still alive.

	That the neo-pagan movement is giving (largely truthful) voice to a
very real and very powerful movement in the spirit of modern people and
modern life cannot be doubted.  For at least 3, and up to 5 centuries,
the dominant voice in European culture has been male and "Saturnian" --
cold, restrictive, and anti-sexual.  The warm, fertile, sensual, feminine
spirit is alive in all of us (even convinced Christian clerics), and has
once again found a voice.  Vale, Jube, Gaudeamus!

	"In period" -- roughly 1066-1660 A.D., the _nobility_ were _all_ both
practicing and believing Catholics (most of their descendants still are,
in one form or another).  The last non-Catholic, non-christian nobility
in Western Europe were massacred in the Albigensian Crusade in the first
centuries of our period.
	The middle class, such as existed, tended to "ape their betters", 
and at least contribute to the upkeep of the local church.  At the end of
our period, they began to take power away from the nobility in all
European countries, and almost unanimously embraced Protestantism.
	_NO ONE AT ALL_ cared or noticed what the peasants did, so long
as the harvest was gathered in on time.  They thus kept on doing whatever
it was that they had been doing since Neolithic times, with some sporadic
interference from wandering hedge priests.
	_Rome_ certainly did not care -- the whole thrust of the Roman Church
since the mid-900s has been to regain the temporal power of the Roman
Emporers, and its entire emphasis has been on those classes percieved in
each century since then as the holders of power.  Only in this century
have they begun to consider that the common people have any power
whatever.
	One of the chief tenets of Roman State Religion embraced by the
mediaeval church was that there shall be no political challenge to the
established hierarchy, so, just as the Romans totally destroyed the Druid
resistance to their political hegemony, the Roman Curia destroyed any
religious movement (including Celtic Christianity) which threatened _its_
hegemony.  The Catholic nobility of Europe gleefully followed suit in
their own bailiwicks -- the last pagan King of England died in the New
Forest in 1099, at the hands of his own huntsman (William Rufus -- and I
believe that I may be a descendant of that huntsman, btw).

	We fought a Revolution in this country a bit over 200 years ago, not
only to escape taxes, but also to escape the dead hand of religious
repression and power-mongering.  Religious tolerance is thus bred into
us, bone & sinew (however much we squabble about it, and however much
random television fascists abuse the privelege).  The Society cannot
afford to either encourage or forbid the practice of any given religion
(human scarifice excepted, of course -- sorry, no blots, fellas).

	Out-and-out Germanic/Norse paganism in Europe since 1933 has a far
different taste to it than the environmental eroticism of modern American
neo-paganism, however.  It makes Europeans decidedly (and deservedly)
nervous to remember just where _that_ led -- Treblinka, Auschwitz, and
others.  Christians were next on the list.
	I think milord Wm de Corbie has good and sufficient reasons to be
leery of anything that smacks of a continuation of Odinism into modern
times, but no problem with the more open variety of the Craft that we
know and love -- let us therefore be easy on him, and turn to more
entertaining subjects -- like gossiping about the awfullness of "stick
jocks".  "Merry meet, merry part", eh?

Subject: Games

Keeping the older kids distracted isn't hard at all; just get some general
silliness started for all. Our local Fools' Guild has taken to starting games
of Comets (basically a slightly complex version of catch) at almost every
event; this generally starts with the college students, draws all available
kids in pretty quickly, and then starts pulling in the peers. It's amazing
how much people can get into the simplest games when the enthusiasm is
present...

Similarly, we sometimes get games of Blind Man's Buff going (I think Master
Kobayashi usually instigates this); these have been known to suck entire
events in for an hour at a time. Or, if you have space, a game of Bocce can
be fun for all...

 I don't know if the rules change from year to year but from someone
that mistakenly did some volunteer trolling for 12 hours in a row -
minors were turned away if their legal parent or guardian was not with
them.

There was a whole car of kids under eighteen that were sent back and 
a whole car sent back because one of the kids were under eighteen and
the kid had neither  legal guardian or parent with him even though
there were several offering to ACT as his legal guardian.


Hope this helps.

We solved this problem at our event with a nursery.  Our group is
lucky enough to have a child psychologist that parents willingly
leave their children at the door.  The parents signed up and helped
one hour for 6 hours' care.  I'm not sure how the evening ended but
we also had a childrens' feast for them earlier and some of them 
were then calm at the adults' feast.  They were more interested in
trying the adults' dishes and had a lot of fun.  The events for them
were different than the others and were completely the responsibility
of our child psychologist.


She had two assistants that checked up on here throughout the day and
didn't seem harassed for the wear.  It was greatly received.

	To my Lady of Hindscroft and or my Lord Gornych,
	Sam'l de Bassett sends most cordial greetings in the name of Society!

	If any officer or any group is actively trying to forbid the practice of
any religion within the Society, I would be inclined to take personal action
to raise a stink with the Board of Directors. I would be quite interested in
further details.

	The problem with the Society's "cultishness" has been with us from the
beginning -- various investigations by various police departments around the
country generally leave the police filing the complaint in the "nut file" --
we are weird, yes, but not threatening in any way.  Screaming redneck bilbe
thumpers are irritating, but can be put under peace bond;  bigoted bosses can
be taken to court for religious/ethnic/ridiculous discrimination.
	The way to handle cultural philistines is to look 'em in the eye and say:
"The way I dress and act is perfectly legal and normal.  What's _your_
problems, Jack?"  Randall Garrett once defined the Society as being a way for
men to walk around in drag -- and carry a sword for them as snickered.

	_Internal_ intolerance is a fact of life, too -- since the Society's roots
are intertwined with those of SF Fandom (the dreaded fen), we have always had
our quota of militant atheist "humanists" who are sure (at the top of their
voices) that _THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS {name anything} AND WE ARE SIMPLY NOT
GOING TO ALLOW IT HERE!!_  As I said in a earlier posting, they were usually
more afraid of "black magic", hugger-mugger & booga-booga than the convinced
Christians, pagans & miscellaneous magicians.
	This is more a matter of _BAD MANNERS_ than anything else -- they need to
be educated about getting along with others (i.e. socialized like any other
noisy adolescent) -- individually.  If, on the other hand, they get
evangelical and start trying to convert everyone else to their particular
creed (at the point of a {rattan} sword, maybe :-), it's time to do some
serious Crusading . . .

	I'm bored -- anybody seen any windmills lately??

	Hmmmm...   In the kingdoms that I have any experience in, an
award scroll was given by the Kingdom to the recipient. (In fact, the
Scribes of Ansteorra had a policy: One free scroll to the person per 
award.  If it wasn't to that persons taste then they could have 
another made *But they would have to pay for it*.  And given the 
time it takes, let alone the appraisals I've heard for some scrolls,
that's a bit of money.  But if you wanted it, you could get it.  If it
met the Scribes (Guild? College?  What did they call themselves...) 
standards then they would see that it was signed and sealed for you,
regardless of who made it.  Though I never saw it stated, the Midrealm
seemed to operate in much the same way.)  I've never heard of a promissory
scroll being other than that, a promise of a scroll.

)your group demand money for entertaining? Or what if there is a very skilled
)dancer in your group, and you ask him/her to put together a dance piece for
)the revel, and he/she demands to get paid?

	I have heard of musicians being paid... usually by the meal! 
(Playing for their suppers indeed.)  But the person wasn't in SCA,
*mearly* a local expert on Medieval and Rennisaunce music.  Certainly
the dinner (while it was excellent) wasn't enough to pay for the hour
or two that he played, but he also enjoyed the atmosphere, and live
music (offstage, as it were) adds greatly to the feast.

 
)What is fair and right here? The skilled calligrapher, dancer, musician,
)armorer or seamstress all have their work admired at events. They will all
)get their Laurels if they are good enough. But some of them also get paid
)for what they do, while others are expected to do their work for free.

	I won't profess to know the answer.  I certainly enjoy the
work of all of them.  But the only means of distinguishing their work
seems to be one of use.  

	If an armorer makes a helm, it is to be used, by himself or someone
else.  If a seamstress makes garb, again, it is going to be used, worn in
this case.  The person using it will get some utilty out of it.  But in
the case of the first three artisans, their work is not *used*.  I don't 
*use* my award scroll (In fact, I'm a little embarassed by it, but more on
that later), those who watch the dance don't use it, and those who listen
or dance to the music don't use it.  I can see this as a distinction,
but why it makes one acceptable to charge for and the others not isn't
quite so clear.

 
)I would like to ask your opinions on this. If someone charges for his work,
)should this mean he is disqualifying himself from receiving orders and/or

	Hmmm...  I don't think that anyone would argue much with Shadowmaker's
Laurel, which was awarded at Pennsic this year. (Shadowmaker, for those of
you on the far coast, is a superb blademaker.)  His work is excellent, and
has enriched the Society, I didn't see anything wrong with his recieving
an award, even a Peerage, for it.  

	Charging for teaching outside your group is something I would hope
that we could avoid.  I can see helping someone with travel expenses if
they traveled to help you with something, but in as much as we are all in
this together, I would hope that if you would do it for one group for no
charge, that it would be the same everywhere.  But this is just persona;
opinion.

	I think that there should be some recognition if someone does
for free what another would charge for, but we also get into questions 
of getting what you pay for...

	All in all, an interesting and thorny question.


(Now then, a question of my own.  Like most everyone, I was delighted
to recieve my AoA.  But...  I'm literally embarassed by the scroll.
If it was done by my eight year old daughter (assuming I *had* an 
eight year old daughter.. or son) I would proudly hang it on the wall.
The problem is that it wasn't.  It is bad that the promissory scroll
is better looking...  to the point where I honestly feel that the
award scroll does not reflect well on the society, and haven't hung it
for that reason.  But...

	The person who made it is in this (SCA) with me.  They were 
doing something for the Kingdom, devoting their time and effort and
money to the project.  I don't feel that I would be totally right in
complaining to them.  I wish I could display it as a proud example of
what we can do.  I don't feel that it is.  ~sigh~  

	I'm not asking what should be done about it, I know what I'm
going to do (nothing.)  But how do others feel about this kind of thing.
What do you do when someone elses work doesn't measure up to what *you*
think the society can do?  )

I just take the finished spring, grasp it firmly on both ends with pliers, 
and pull.  It makes the size change a little, but not enough to be seen
or felt without a *close* inspection.  It makes a whole bunch of rings

Children and the SCA:  I also needed to take a deep breath here, and
wonder if Mr. Litchfield had a bad experience.
 
In my experience (Midrealm and Eastrealm) children have always
been very welcome.  They are a real treasure in Ealdormere,
especially as there are not very many yet.  There are a few
people who entered as children, helped from the day they joined
and are now of age and holding office, teaching, fighting and
other things- as Lady Arval said, they tend to give exemplary
service.  Unlike many of their peers, they have learned to
deal comfortably with adults at an early age-and that's a big
step forward in today's world.
 
There is an increasing number of young children in our ranks
as people get married, and get older.  I would say it is primarily
the responsibility of the parents -they should not let their
children run wild just because it is the SCA.
 
It's also part of an autocrat's responsibility to make some
kind of arrangement.  Most groups and willing and able
to at least provide a room or a corner of a room
for children, and many groups are able to provide
a couple of gentles to help out with the daycare.
 
Finally, all of us, parents and non-parents, need to treat our
children as PEOPLE.
 
Children under four should not be expected to be heroic just
because it is SCA.  In Skraeling, our parents set time aside
for the baby's afternoon rest, pay attention to the child's
need for quiet, and leave the hall with the baby if the baby
is having a  crying spell.
 
Once children reach about four, they can be
treated as REASONABLE people too!  What I mean by that, is
that they are able to listen to reason, they understand
(if you have been teaching them) the meaning of HOLD and
OYEZ, and they want to play the game just as much as you do.
There are plenty of ways in which they are able to help.
They can run errands, help in the kitchen, play with the
younger children, observe quietly, take classes.
 
We did have a problem with a five-year-old at a recent event.
Everyone was too busy or too polite to speak to her parents,
who were relatively new, and one of whom was ill and
should not have tried to attend.  A couple of people talked to
the seneschal of their group, and the seneschal it turn had
a quiet talk with the parents after the event,
in a way that no-one was embarassed but the point got
across.  As the co-autocrat, I took note that it was worth
planning for a children's area for our next large event.
I went back and had a read at the article in the Known Worlde
Handbook on children's activities in the SCA, too.  This is
a new experience for all of us, as for many years there were
no children under 14 in our group.
 
We have a responsibility to contribute to a young person's
socialization as much as we do to an older new person's
socialization (and don't kid yourself--LOTS of us were older
than 20 when we joined!!).
 
Reminder:  Everyone who is behaving and trying to play the game
           has the right to be treated as a lord or lady,
           chestful of danglies or not.
 
When I see someone with a "dangly" or a "tin hat" I assume they
have earned it,  in the same way that I can assume a person
in the workaday world has earned a doctorate, if they're called
"Dr.", or worked to get elected, if they're called "Prime Minister".

Subject: On Children and Charging for Skills

Greetings, good fisherfolk.

In the Barony of Dragonship Haven, people were concerned about the roles and
presence of kids even before the Kingdom officially recognized the need.  Part
of what they do now is make sure that an indoor site contains some nursery
space, where kids can play, nap, get changed, or whatever, and there is always
at least one adult supervising the nursery all day long.  This substantially
cuts down on the number of bored, whiny children in court, and they no longer
have to play tag around the merchants' tables or get underfoot.

This is an enormous help to the parents who have other jobs to do during the
day (especially the single ones).  It is also a boon to those of us who are not
all that fond of children and are sick of having to chase them out of the 
kitchen with rolling pins.  As for the thirteen-year-olds I know, most of them
are too busy fetching things, carrying messages, serving the feast, practicing
recorder in the corner, learning to make chain mail...

On charging for services: None of the scribes I know would even think of
charging for an award scroll!  This is part of the service one does as part of
the Tyger Clerk's stable of scribes.  In addition, we fix misspelled names (NOT
an easy task), letter in the blazons where people's arms were passed after the
AoA was awarded, perform repair and maintenance on scrolls that have aged or
were mistreated over the years, et cetera.  (I won't even get into the issue of
the autocrats who say, "Let's have So-and-So do prize scrolls for our event.
It's so much cheaper than buying prizes...")

We buy our own supplies and give the scrolls to the Kingdom for free.  (In times
past, my shire has volunteered to underwrite part of the cost of the paper for
our shire awards -- it's a minuscule amount, but it's the thought that counts.)
And no, we won't all get Laurels after we do this for awhile.  Actually, very
few of the Laurels given in the East were given for calligraphy and illumina-
tion.

I ask only one thing in return for the time and money I put into my craft:
feedback.  Nothing could make a scribe happier than for the recipient to
approach him/her and say, "Gee, I really liked this scroll", or even "Hey, 
thanks."  Our Queen is wonderful about sending acknowledgements to every scribe
for the award scrolls she gives, but she is unique (and alas, but her reign
hath all too short a date).

If you received a promissory note instead of an AoA scroll and are still
waiting for the real thing, you might check with the Tyger Clerk to see what
has happened to your scroll.  Just write him a polite note.  You're also welcome
to post a note to me here and I'll take care of it.

You shall know me by the ink stains on my fingers...

  religion. I refuted this as impossible. I tried to come up with a theory
  as to why they would make such a claim. I never said that *all* American
  groups were making unrealistic claims. It is gratifying to hear that most
  of them are aware of that they are re-creating things out of the past.

>Games of "my tradition is more authentic than your tradition" are completely

>your religion is more worthwhile than my religion.

  I agree completely. The purpose of the paragraph about my church was this:
  I had written that modern Norse paganism is a newly-invented religion and
  not the same thing as the original Viking religion. Some gentles then implied
  that modern Christianity is equally different from medieval Christianity.
  I wanted to demonstrate that this is wrong: my religion is indeed the same
  one as the christianity of the Middle Ages. It seems that you are reading
  attitudes out of this paragraph which aren't there.

  I don't understand where you got that impression. I have not questioned
  the teachings or legitimacy of modern Paganism, except in the case I refer
  to above, where I stated that for *scientific* reasons, I don't believe
  their claim of being a surviving wing of the Viking-age religion. This has
  *nothing* to do with the fact that I am a Christian. I never intended to
  start a debate of Christianity versus Paganism, because such a thing clearly
  does not belong in the SCA net.

  I am a Lutheran minister and belong to the Church of Sweden. You should be
  aware of that "Lutheran" means something different over here than it means 
  in the USA. Our tradition is more "Anglican" or even "Catholic" than those
  congregations in America who are usually called "Lutheran".

M'lady Awilda Halfdane,

I do not believe that William was attacking the pagan religions.  What I
drew from his writings was that current Odinism is a construction from
what is now known about the old religion.  As much of what the rituals
and such of the old religion really were has been lost to time, he is
denying that any groups of Odinists can state that their rituals are
exactly duplicating what would have occured centuries ago.  This is how
I interpreted what he wrote.  I never sensed any hints of religious 
intolerance, only intolerance for what cannot scientifically or
historically be.

Greetings;

In response to the paid vs. non-paid
discussion currently going on, let me
give some personal examples.

- I made some gauntlets and traded them
  for some other things (I was paid)

- I built a harp and gave it away as a prize.

- I commissioned a scribe to calligraph a
  letter of intent for a tournament I wished
  to enter ( I paid the scribe)

- The price for the above letter of intent was
  that I performed a song for a friend of the
  scribe at the feast of the event ( Again I
  view this barter as being paid.)

- A talented scribe I know was commissioned to
  do a knighthood scroll by the lady of said
  knight. Price was in the hundreds of dollars
  I believe (it was an incredible scroll
  professionally appraised at perhaps a thousand
  dollars value mundanely).

- All of the prizes given at our recent Tournament
  of the Lions in Bjornsborg (San Antonio) were
  freely donated.

 One of the points I have gleaned from this
 discussion which I agree with is that one shouldn't
 *assume* that someone will just donate their
 skill/craftsmanship.In my kingdom (Ansteorra) your 
 first award scroll is a gift from the Kingdom 
 (or maybe more accurately a gift from the college
 of scribes). I believe, although I may be a little
 mistaken here, that scrolls after this are
 usually commissioned.

 After all this rambling, my point is this:

 Gifts are gifts and I don't expect to be paid
 for them.
 Merchandise is merchandise and I expect to be
 paid for it.

 Dancers and musicians are in somewhat of a grey area
 do to the non-permanence of a performance. You can't
 take a dance performance home and hang it on your 
 wall. However, I have seen situations where musicians
 are paid in some sense to perform. Many of the middle-
 eastern dancers are paid by the appreciative crowd
 after a fine performance. On the other hand if I stand
 up in the middle of the ladies pavilion to do a song  
 it is a gift and I expect nothing more than the
 courtesy of people not walking all over my performance.
 You don't even have to listen if you don't want.

 More rambling....sorry

Subject:  money for services rendered...

Gentles, lend me your eyes, I pray; these words may help in understanding
the apparent lack of iron-clad rules for when work is free and not....

When I charge a person for performing some service, constructing garb or
armor, for instance, it is because it is something I am not doing anyway.
I have been requested to do something extra, something which will not
otherwise reward me, in such ways as *fun*.  When I don't, it is usually
because the activity is *FUN*, such as singing, dancing, or teaching how
to make the same garb or armor.

Often this same philosophy applies in the real world, where people do such
things as donating time to house-building or refurbishing, while their
mundane occupation is something akin to desk-jockey.  They are having *fun*
while 'working' on the house, as opposed to *working* at their job, doing
something which is not inherently enjoyable.

I hope these humble offerings of my opinions may be of some small aid.

Greetings good gentles of the Rialto,

My "talents", if you will, are needlework-related.  I make blackwork,
cut/drawn work, simple (and not so simple) embroidery, etc.  My passion
is making lace.  Lace is something of a singular thing.  Most wicker stores
sell doileys (doilies?) for around 5 or 10 bucks (machine made and not
usually suitable for SCA use).  It would take me no small amount of time to
complete a similar piece - $10 would not come close to compensating me for
my time, perhaps not even for the supplies.  Even if I were to charge
minimum wage for my work (William, that's $3.35/hour, U.S. :) ), most folk
would not be able to afford my work.  While I'd like to start doing appraisal/
repair of lacework with local antique shops one day, lace making is not
something to make a living at.

However, if someone were to approach me, asking to learn how to make lace,
I would be ecstatic!  I like teaching and sharing what I know.  Another lace
maker is another source of information, another mind looking at things in a
way different than I do.  If I were to set a price for teaching at all, it
would be for supplies - my know-how they get for free.

I have a friend who asked a gentle within her group to be taught one of her
crafts.  She was more or less informed "you do something for me, I do some-
thing for you."  I was positively *INFURIATED*.  That kind of attitude
just doesn't belong in the Society.  ...I ended up offering to teach her
myself.

Hypothetically, if a friend who was new to the Society were to come to me
with X yards of fabric and ask if I could make him/her a T-tunic, I'd do it
at no cost.  An Elizabethan bodice is another matter.  At the same time, I
would attempt to work out some sort of barter rather than work for cash.
The SCA is a rich place for this.  He wants an Italian Renn outfit and I
want a carved/decorated corset busk.  We both get an opportunity to work
at our craft and get something we need/want out of the bargain as well.

The bottom line, for me anyway, is that the SCA, like my lace work, is a
hobby.  It is not my life.  If I find that I have no personal use for what
I make, I'll give it to someone who can use it.  Occasionally, I've made
lace with a specific person in mind.  If offered a commision to make a 
lace piece, I might likely take it, trying to offer what would be a fair
price to both the "client" and myself.  In general, I view it as my
contribution to the Society.  It has no price.  Its value only lies in
what value I choose to put in it - as well as the pride I have while
wearing it or in seeing others wearing my work.  I guess I don't need
an other compensation.

Subject: Kids at SCA Events
Message-Id: <2333@canisius.UUCP>

If I may put in my two cents in on the subject of children at events...
If children are "getting under foot" it's generally because their energy
doesn't have any acceptable channels, so make some.

The idea of a children's area is a good one.  Permit me to add a few additional
activities.  Before an event, go to a place that sells rugs.  Ask them for a
few empty cardboard rolls that the rugs come wrapped around.  They'll have
them, especially if they do installation.  Paint them to look like logs.
Have a children's "caber toss".  (For the unintiated, a caber toss is a
Scot's (not scouts!) competition where the competitors try to see who can
toss a small telephone pole (minimum : 8 feet, 75 lbs, a "woman's caber"
can be smaller) the farthest in an end-over-end flip.

Have a boffer tourney.  At a hardware store, you can get a pack of pipe
insulation (cylinders of foam rubber), and presto!, eight "swords".

There are running around games which can be played with both adults and
children together.  We use them a lot at our barony's outdoor events.  The
games which require greater agility are frequent WON by the children as
most adults aren't nearly as quick.  Master Salamaalah's (sp?) book is
a good source.  Drop me a line if you want more, I can tell you the ones
which are a favorite in our barony.

Have a variety of activities for them to do.  Coloring cardboard shields
(for their boffer tourney!), making banners (keep the heralds away, they
go weak in the knees when they see "Azure, two hockey sticks in saltire, Or."
;-) ;-) ;-) ), some of the older kids can even make chainmail if you have
an adult supervise.

Get them involved in the event.  Ice Dragon (an ungodly huge event) has
a 100-man tourney with four list areas running simultaneously.  To keep
straight who goes where, we have a heraldic display system.  Four poles
are set up on stage, where all can see them.  They have room for two rows
of two shields each.  The poles are colored coded to match the four list
areas.  When you see your device go up on the bottom row of the blue pole
that means your on-deck in the blue list.  When your match is called, the
top row is removed, the bottom row is moved to the top, and the new on-deck
pair is put on the bottom.  This involves a lot of shields transferring back
and forth between the poles and and the shield box (which has grown to 350+
shields over the last several years!).  The shield box has to be by the 
MoL table so the they know which shields are next.  When an adult did the
running, he begged for relief 3/4 of the way through the 1st round.  They
gave the job to a couple of kids, gave them some brief instructions (ie
listen to the marshalls, heralds and people at the poles and stay out
of the list areas) and they had a blast running the shields back and forth
for the rest of the tourney!  By the by, heralds take note.  If a fighter
doesn't have a device, his name gets written (not calligraphed, SCRAWLED!)
on blank shield with a cheap magic marker.  When they see this hanging on
the pole with three pretty shields, they usually get a device submitted by
the next tourney.

There are other activities they can do at events as well.  Table serving,
assisting, heralding (anyone ever complain they CAN'T hear a kid yell?),
etc.  We actually had a fourteen year old (raised in the society) autocrat
an event!  The barony officers stipulated that she have a "sub-autocrat" old
enough to sign hall rental agreements and drive a car, but that's all he
ended up doing!  She ran the event with clockwork precision, some of our
adult autocrats haven't done nearly as well!

Subject: letters of recommendation

Letters of dis-recommendation?  I have never heard of such a thing, and i 
don't think it would work, at least not in the obvious way.

in the polling orders, on the otherhand, the members' opinions are solicited, 
and it is thier duty to respond to the best of thier ability, and if they 
believe that a person should not be a member of that order, when that persons 
name comes up on the poling list they should say so, and also why.  Any one 
can recommend another for membership in such an order, but it is up to the 
members to try to keep people out, as best they can, by giving informed 
opinions to the royalty.  This is not slimey any more than reviewing technical 
articles for technical journals is slimey.  It is so that when people *do* get 
inducted into the order, they know that knowlegable people have seen and 
approved of thier work, and their award means more than the favor of a 
six-month monarch.

if an officer, as an officer, has reason to know that someone is doing a
good job of something, he (she) should certainly say so.  e.g. if i, as head 
of the cooks guild, have an opportunity to see someone's researach efforts 
first hand (as i often do), i will say something like "x is a member of the 
cooks guild, and worked up a recipie for tripe stew from a 14 c manuscript 
that is authentic, and good, x is a valuable contrubutor to many of our 
meetings."  If an officer knows that someone is doing good work in his (her) 
field, there is no reason to diguise or disclaim the office:  there is no 
reason to believe that it is the office speaking (unless the office is the 
crown) e.g. "at the feast of st. y, x served a tripe stew, which i judge to be 
authentic, and which was very good  (signed) malice, head of carolingian cooks 
guild."

Harder questions (i think) are the worth of petitions (have you ever had a 
letter of recommendation thrust at you at an event by someone saying "we're 
sending a letter of recommendation for x, you wanna sign it? (how did it make 
you feel?)),  and the worth of letters written by a group, as a group e.g. "we, 
the members of the x guild (in which case it had better by unanimous) would 
like to bring to your attention...".  or, "we, members of the (baronial level 
service award order) would like to reccomend to you..."    we (the members of 
the baronial level service award order) have been trying that last tack for a 
couple years now with very little result.  a friend says we may be  conveying 
the idea "here is this person whom we don't think is worthy of being in our 
order but you should give him (her) an AOA any way"  !!! i don't think so, but 
who understands the minds of kings?

Other miscellanious things:  

	Chain mail-  have any of you tried mixing chain and strips of metal?  
a number of saracen or turkish suits seem to have a round chestpiece about the 
sise of a hub cap to which the chain is attached.  The higgens armory had two 
suite made of pieces of metal held together with chain mail 4 links wide-- a 
round chestpiece, a yolk-shaped back shoulder piece, several strips down the 
back, strips two fingers wide on the leg pieces.  One of them had all the flat 
peices decorated with rabbits (yea!)  What would the properties of  such armor 
be?  it looks like a lot less work!    

	money-	as a good american, i find M. de corbie's issue a non-issue.  
If people have skills worth selling, and there are people who are willing to 
pay for them, they will get paid, be they musicians, calligraphers, or belly 
dancers.  On the other hand, it made me wonder,  who does make all those 
scrolls?  What is this promissory note thing--i always thought it meant 'the 
calligrapher hasn't got your scroll finished yet, but we wanted you to have 
this this reign'  but your posting implys its something like a licence to have 
a scroll made.  calligraphers???

	steven--sory for the public appearance of this note, but would you be 
willing to write about your household?  it was started somewhat at least as a 
household for newpeople, and for several years, at least it was a very good 
thing.

Subject: Children and Mercenaries
Message-Id: <2386@lindy.Stanford.EDU>

Hello Alt.Sca, I finally had the time to figure out how to post, as
well as read, boy are you in trouble.

On the subject of children at SCA events:

Basically, I have nothing against children at SCA events (not
anymore than my general dislike for children).  However, I have
trouble tolerating children that disrupt SCA events.

Before anyone yells at me too much, the parents of the children are
usually to blame, not the children themselves.  Example:  Parents of
crying babies, who don't remove themselves (and the child) from
court.

My biggest personal dislike involves loud screaming (crying)
children late on Friday nights (midnight), who keep me awake.  I can
understand why the child is upset, I'd be upset if I just spent 6
hours in a car, was tired, hungry, and all my parents did was yell:
   "SHUT UP, THE TENT WILL BE UP 10 MINUTES AND YOU CAN GO TO BED"

Again, the blame seems to be more on the parents, not the children.
However, as I am not a parent, I can't offer any good suggestions
that would help.

My personal hope in this matter, would be that parents be observant
with regards to who they and their childern might be disturbing (as
many times, the parent becomes more disturbing than the child).
(I've always thought there should be three ends to camp:  Noisy,
Quiet, and "No Children".  But no one seems to take me seriously.)

In regards to Mercenaries:

I see nothing wrong with the hiring of Mercenaries at Wars.  As long
as no one is paying SCA funds for their hire.  I would prefer that
"real money" wasn't involved, however, I can't see any way to stop
someone from "hiring" a fighter to be on their side, and paying
"cold hard cash" (as they could do it under the table if the SCA
tried to outlaw it).

I have many times fought as a Mercenary, when I was not obligied to
fight on one side or the other.  Or did not have a strong personal
preference to one side in the combat.  However, many times I have
declined offers, so that I could fight with my friends (or
whatever).

At most wars that I have attended, there has usually been an attempt
to "balance the sides", after the first few battles.  As the idea is
to have fun, not keep stomping one side into mush.  And yes, I
fought for the West in the famed "12 in An Tir" (12 Westerners vs
100+ AnTirians).  We actually fought 2 battles that way, and it was
fun.  But we then split the sides up evenly.

I don't see Mercenaries being a problem, as long as everyone
remembers the idea is to have fun.

More later, can't spend all my time doing this.

Ah, Benedictine.  One of the oldest cordials around. It was originally
a cure-all medicine. Interesting is that cordials were considered mostly
only medicines untill the 1700's.

I have heard that Benedictine has nearly 100 spices, fruits, herbs, and leaves
for ingredients, and have never been able to find how to make one from
base ingredients.  So if anyone has a recipe I would like to know too. There
is a "cheater's" way to make it if you want to. A company called
T. Noirot (from France) produces all kinds of extracts.  Their "Reverendine"
extract is for making Benedictine.

Cheater's Benedictine:
3 and 1/2 cups 80-proof vodka
1 cup sugar
1 bottle Reverendine extract
(optional: upto 1/4 cup water to cut the alcohol content)
That's It!

Noirot also has an Amaretto extract.

The extracts can be found at Wine Making Supply shops.

	Randall of Hightower once told an amusing story in my hearing of how
the ancient Athenians were supposed to have collected monies to defray
the costs of the polis:
	During grand meetings of the people (demos), a virgin would be sent
walking through the crowd with an upturned helmet, with her eyes cast
piously up to the heavens, and lo and behold, when she had passed through
the whole crowd, the helmet would be full of enough money to defray the
costs of whatever project was at hand.
	This, he maintained, was the origin of the Society custom of "passing
the helmet".  (He did admit that the two large hairy bodyguards who
followed her might have something to do with the generosity of the
contributors and the fact that all the money went _into_ the helmet, and
none came out while she was not watching.

	Charming story -- and yes, the practice of "passing the helmet" to
defray site expenses has been traditional in the Mists, at least, since
before the first coronation of Henrik I.

Though my favorite device for winding coils is an engine lathe, when I
don't have access to such fun equipment, I use a reversable variable
speed drill and an oak block to anchor the free end of the mandrell.
The reverse allows me to correct mistakes, and the variable speed keeps
things going at a sane rate. As long as the speed is sane and the wire
can be fed without kinking, and the jig is used properly, I believe that
this method is reasonably safe.

I made a little jig that can be clamped to a horizontal band saw. Works
great, almost no work and the links butt smoothly. I have sucessfully

Children belong to the Middle Ages as they were and as they should 
have been. I have never seen any really bad behavior by SCA kids,
and if there was a problem I would go and talk to the parents.

As for kids with danglies, it is healthy to remember that in the
early middle ages, boys were *knighted* at fifteen. Later, 21 years
became the standard minimum age.

Lady Fionnghuala, thanks for your comments on the money subject.

I was not making any point at all with my posting about money. I was
merely interested in hearing what people thought about the role of
money in the SCA.

Thinking about it, I came to the conclusion that work = work, and if one
type of work is rewarded with money, why should another type not be?
It seems illogical, but then who said that the world is a logical place?

I was talking about payment for work, not about reimbursement for costs.
Thus, the costs of the materials are beside the point. It could be argued
that it takes just as long to make a scroll as it takes to make a helm,
but that is also beside the point. The amount of work that goes into
an object may determine how much we pay for it, but not *if* we pay at
all. Rather, it seems that certain types of work are paid, others not.

Perhaps this is just one of those things that cannot be explained
rationally. But I think that it is healthy to have an open mind
and not take it for granted that certain things must be free while
others must cost money.

   Many of the religious had powerful positions in society and were 
corrupt, as well as "sinful" as it were.  It's interesting study for
story-telling.  Especially for those that have problems with the  
Catholic church.  I feel it sad that so many interesting topics from
the church are not encouraged because the history of the Rosary and 
other stories that I was taught growing up are interesting to me.

However, this is the Middle Ages in the twentieth century where 
the study of witchcraft is also allowed and if you encourage the
study of Catholic religion, then fairly, one should allow the study
of witchcraft. 

The problem I was told, was SCA has had some problems being branded as
an occult group because the "witches" were so voiceferous so in the in-
terest of staying that brand, I keep my studies to myself.  


Correct me if I'm wrong.  I tend to be a little mellower these days.

William, I beg to differ.  Yes, there are an awful lot of neo-pagans in the
United States (and Canada and Europe for that matter) who are trying very hard
to recreate the ancient religions.  And yes, back when it was all very new and
people were trying to establish paganism as a legitimate religion people did
claim ancient origins for their teachings.  Now they claim that they are
recreating ancient religions as best as possible based on the historical and
archeological evidence availible to them.  Yes, there is a lot still unknown
and perforce we must fill in the blanks with our best guesses.  And this is
the the modern world (human sacrifice is right out) so we must adapt our rites to
serve the our modern prejudices and needs.  We are an industrial, urban society,
these religions come out of an agricultural, rural society.  Some people get
pretty far-fetched in their adaptions, but most of the people I know are very
diligent about their scholarship and are careful to distinguish between what is
known and what is conjecture.  You are very harsh in your assessment of
American pagans, I think you need more information from our side.

I am a native American, my beliefs are considerably different at their core
than are those of most pagans.  Nonetheless I have found the "outer teachings"
of many pagan deities to be useful to me, so I believe in them, and worship
them when necessary.  I think my religion is just as valid as anybody else's in
spite of the fact that it is highly eclectic.  To my way of thinking, religion
MUST be eclectic to useful.  Mass produced religion applies only to the 
masses.  Individuals must examine their conscience and pick and choose what is
most appropriate for them. 

This is something all pagans understand.  Games of "my tradition is more
authentic than your tradition" are completely irrelevant.  The fact that your
church was built in 1290 does not mean that your religion is more worthwhile than
my religion.  The fact that you are a Christian minister does not mean that you
are better qualified than anybody else to discuss religion; it only means that
you have gone to great lengths to discover what is right for you.  I realize
your congregation expects you to purvey religion to them, but religion 
cannot be learned, it is felt in the heart.  This is a Protestant view, that
each man can commune with God without the intervention of a priest.  It is also
a very popular pagan view, that each of us is our own priest/ess.  Paganism is
a religion without congregation, each participant is his own minister.

This must be very bewildering to you.  With the vast weight of Christian law
and custom backing you up, any "do-it-yourself" religion must not seem
legitimate because it is so radically different, attacking as it does the basic
foundations of your faith.  Well, just remember, America was settled by people
who ran away from people like you, and who built us a safeguard of absolute
religious freedom.  At this very moment there is a special committee meeting at
the Vatican to decide what to do about those troublesome American Catholics
who won't follow the Church's line.  It is something I am very curious about:
Is the Pope willing to alienate his largest and wealthiest flock by demanding
they follow his teachings?  Or will the Pope change the Christian line to a
form more palatable to Americans and so maintain his grip on their purses strings? 

And now a personal question.  From your earlier references to "your church" and
"your predecessors" I am assuming that you are a Catholic priest.  Nonetheless,
you have not explicitly said so, and Catholicism is not the only religion in
Europe, so I would like to make certain I understand your position.

As for myself, I claim nothing accept that I am an intelligent human being
capable of making my own decisions.

Yours in service,

Message-ID:  <8903122217.aa08420@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

The discussion about financial reqrd for skill has gotten me to thinking about
the increasing number of mercenary fighters in the SCA.  Now I think a person
ought to be able to get paid for his effort when he goes out of his way to do
something he wasn't planning to do. Making garb for somebody else, for example.
But fighters go to the wars to fight because they enjoy fighting.  To insist on
getting paid for it seems wrong.  I realized that mercenary companies are
thoroughly period, but it still bothers me, especially when I look at the long
term impact.  When I hear about bolts of silk being used to buy mercenaries, I
wonder where the silk came from and who paid for it.  Does it come out of the
king's pocket?  That seems unfair.  Does it come from society funds? (Can any
one say "taxes").  Is it donated?  If mercenaries become a major force, does
this means that wars will become a battle of the pocket book with victory going
to whoever can afford to buy the most mercenaries?  And worse yet, does this
mean that our leaders are going to be the people with the biggest wallets?

American elections generally go to the people who spend the most money and look
what kind of government it's gotten us.  Do we want this to happen in the SCA?
Is it inevitable?  What do we do about it?

Message-ID:  <8903122217.aa08422@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

I have seen artists at events selling their skills in exchange for money.  The
Pennsic War is the biggest example of this, but it occassionally ocurrs at
other events.  I know, because I've done it, and I've seen a few other people
do it.  It is very rare.  nobody has ever told me I should cease and desist,
nor made any kind of negative comment about it.  But then,  I have tried to be
a polite merchant.

The way I and others have worked it is this:  Sell only when merchants are
allowed.  Go over to the merchants area and set up as a merchant.  At Pennsic
hawking your wares is acceptable, at other events a conversatinal tone of
voice is the  proper volume. 

I have sold back rubs and Tarot readings this way.  Now that I am no longer
a desperately poor college student I don't do it.  The other people I have
seen doing it were musicians and jugglers. I suspect that people who do this
do it because they need the cash-you get very little money in exchange for
a lot of  time.  I started doing it at Pennsic and everyone in my car was broke.
The money alloted for gas was used up on the way to War and we couldn't
get home unless we found some revenue.

I personally have no objection to performers working for tips, or any other
kind of artist getting whatever someone will pay for it.  We do these hobbies
because we love them, not to get rich.  All the same, they require a cash
outlay and there is nothing wrong to trying to recoup some of it.

On the other hand, performing music for an event, making scrolls for awards,
and so forth are service to the SCA and should not be financially renumerated.
The proper payment is sincere and hearty thanks, and eventually an award of
some sort recognizing that a gentle who persistantly makes his or her artistic
talents availible for others is a valuable member of the society.  

Objects made for cash can be entered in arts and science competetions.  All of
us are amateurs.  Granted, I know some blacksmiths and cabinet-makers in the
SCA who make their living with their skills, nontheless the things  they
sell to mundanes are different from what is sold in the SCA, so they are
amateurs as far as medeival forms and projects are concerned. Some day far in
the future SCA  may be large enough and wealthy enough for people to make their
living completely in the context of the SCA, at that time it may be necessary
to have amatuer and professional categories in the arts and sciences.

The problem is that 20-year-old members eventually become 30-year-olds.  
(Trust me!  It's about to happen to me.)  As SCAdians reach their thirties,
they often have children.  And if there's no place for those children in
the Society, the members are likely to drop out.  It's hard to spend a 
weekend away from your children, and babysitting bills add up fast.  
I suspect that Ansteorra is simply acknowledging this trend, and
is trying to find ways for people with families to remain active
in the SCA.

(Why amn't *I* active in the SCA anymore?  Simple.  My husband
didn't enjoy it, and I'd rather spend the weekends with him.)

	I remember with some fondness Lady Alison of Hightower demonstrating
how to knit mail from split rings -- smaller versions of the sort of
thing you can buy for carrying keys.
	She had found a commercial source that would sell 1/4 to 1/2" split
rings by the _pound_ rather than by the dozen, and would sit for hours
with a kitchen knife and small pliers and knit swatches of mail.
	Please don't ask where she found the rings -- this was in 1971, and I
am sure she has long since forgotten the company has gone out of
business, etc.
	Since the split rings were stainless steel, the resulting mail was
very good looking, and, if I remember rightly, did a good job (in tests)
of stopping steel.

In "A Glossary of the Construction, Decoration, and Use of Arms and Armor..."
(ISBN 0-517-065878) the author quotes Baron de Cosson (Helmets and Mail 110)

"Thus in the British Museum there is a standard of mail of which the rings 
of the top edge are exceedingly close and stiff, and the usual arrangement 
being altered, so that six rings go through the seventh, not four into the 
fifth."

The author did not believe this report, but it was because he could not
figure out how to do a 6 on 1 pattern, and therefore determined it was
impossible.  Duh.  He still doesn't believe it after reporting that the
stuff is called "double mail".

Sorry, but no dates were mentioned for these pieces. :^(

     I don't see anything wrong with giving awards, or perhaps even a
Patent Peerage, to a thirteen-year-old, provided that they are worthy
of that honor.  Of course, no "brat" is going to be worthy of this
unless they are only a brat in the archaic sense ("brat used to mean
"child").  One of the basic rules for a Patent Peerage, which is, in
theory, supposed to apply to other awards as well, is that one must be
conspicuously courteous.  This means that if anyone, at any age, gets
an award and immediately starts going around bragging about it to all
and sundry, someone has made a mistake.
     Also, it would be very wrong to think that children don't have
anything to contribute.  None of the period topics studied in the SCA
are inaccesible to children, especially if their parents are in the SCA
and are teaching them about the Middle Ages.  And it's always impolite,
and also counterproductive, to ignore someone who is willing and able
to contribute.
     I would like to remind people of a well-known incident involving
some chimpanzees living on a beach, who were being studied by some
primatologists (my memory's a bit hazy on this, but I remember at least
approximately what happened).  The primatologists started giving them
grain to eat, which of course got mixed with the sand.  One of the
younger females discovered that you could get the sand out by washing
the grain in the water.  All the other young ones started doing this,
but the adult males ignored them and went on eating sand.

in response to the postings on children in the SCA and the
original message:

I don't think that the emphasis on children recently was to
make them the focus of our events, and leave out older and
more numerous people. The reason things here in the East seem
to be getting more children oriented is

1) more sca-folk have children and are bringing them to events
2) more children often means more noise and unfocused activity
3) children have (often) nothing to do at events, but can
   we really ban people from events until their kids are
   old enough to do sca things?

The activities are to give kids something to do. We usually
plan things at events for non-fighters (after all, there are
quite a few even though fighting is often the central activity)
and don't want them bored. 

In addition, if a 13 year old has a bunch of awards, I imagine
he/she has EARNED them. Is an award that we recognize on a 23 year
old or a 33 year old or a 43 year old not valid because a 13 year
old can earn it? And probably any kid snotty because he/she has
an award would be a snotty adult too. 

The emhasis and increased activity for children is for the benefit
of all people at an event. More kid's stuff means less bored kids
whining loudly in court, fewer kids aimlessly  tearing around the
tourney field and more productive teens and pre-adolescents when
they have learned all that stuff already.

About the armorer charging for making armor, and the calligrapher
not charging:

Armor making seems rather more expensive to do than calligraphy.
Even when you consider those few scrolls which people put real
gold leaf on, it is not as expensive as making armor, when a
side of leather can cost $40 or more (enough for maybe one 
person's armor). In addition, I imagine it takes much longer to
do armour than it does to make even a rather involved scroll.
In each kingdom (I think) there is an office to help scrolls
get made and get given to the recipient of an award. If someone
doesn't want to do a scroll unless he/she is paid, then I imagine
that he/she won't volunteer to help the signet office.

Often the reward for a singer is being heard. Singing a song is
certainly not as taxing or time consuming as creating a durable
good like armor, etc. I have never run into anyone having trouble
with paying for armor. However, locally it seems like people go
out and buy the raw materials, then get together at someone's
house to make armor. No one pays for the service of learning.

Am I missing the point of Wm. de Corbie? Maybe the cultural
difference between mainland USA groups and European groups is
far vaster than we imagine. I know social customs and such
vary greatly. I wonder how things are in Lochach (spelled?)
(known in alternate times as Australia)

Well, first off, if one of my kids is a problem--please let me know.  The only
feedback I've had is so favorable as to make me wonder if the correct kid has
been identified.  

I'm not so sure about the joining age--but then most of the people I know
well in the Society have been around long enough that the organization was
hard to find.  I joined the day after my 21st birthday.

While recruitment may have been the common growth mode--it won't last
forever.  I would *hope* that growth is also through natural increase.
If it isn't, then we aren't teaching our kids very well.

Examine that "chestful of danglies" carefully.  In the Mists there are
specific children's awards--which are non-armigerous.  My 14-year-old
son has one such.  He got it for doing things like writing an excellent
praise-poem to the then Princess as part of an at-the-site poetry composition
competition.  The Princess then cited it as an example for a fighting 
competiition she asked to be held.  (*That* was--compliment her Highness,
and then try to take the field from the current holder and then defend
the field in single combat against those in turn behind you.)  That day
(it was hot) he was supplying water to fighters as they came off the field.
The non-armigerous award my daughter has she got the hard way.  She's
a member of the Dance group in the West--the Pied Argent.  She got to
be a member by winning the dance competition held on site at a Kingdom
tourney.  The Master of the order said she was the only one who could
do the dance to *both* the orginial music and the last-minute substitute
music.  All of this is to show that there may be a reason for what you
see worn by children.  My Lady and I encourage them to serve the Society
in what ways they can.  Not in hope of reward--that will take care of itself--
but because it is the Right Thing To Do.

Adults sometimes get awards in a short period of time too.  I have been
told of one person who got an AA at his first event.  On Sunday morning
at a Kingdom event he decided that the privies needed cleaning--so he
cleaned them.  Now *that's* service.

If the 13-year-old is acting like a brat--then let the parents know.  If
they take no action, *then* there is a problem.  My Lady and I "dropped
out" for nearly ten years when our children were small because the effort
to watch over and restrain them at tourneys was too much effort.  Now the
kids are civilized--at least as evidenced by the comments I get.

Often, those who make armour know how much time they will have to spend on a
certain piece.  As a musician, I do not know how much time.  I am also
asked to perform by the aurocrat, not by everyone who might be pleased by my
music at the event.  Sometimes, I do not know I will be playing before I arrive.
Furthermore, there is nothing to prevent me to put out a personal hat for
people to contribute into.  At Pensic this is an established custom!

The above are merely observations, but I have an opinion as well:
Musical reproducation is much easier to come by in the modern
world of tape-recorders and radio; the world is currently finding that
because of sound reproduction technology, there is a smaller demand for
musicians, and the supply hasn't decreased to keep pace.  In fact, because
of sound reproduction technology, more people are exposed to very good
music, and more people are therefore good at music!  Thus, anyone can
try and charge for music, but since the consumer can go put on a tape without
losing anything but the extra of live performance, he can't charge much at all.
So the charge to get somebody to perform usually rounds down to nothing.

Ah, Well.  That is why I am not going into music as a career.

Subject: children at events

Greetings one and all from Juliana of Felding, Carolingia, East,

The discussion of children reminds me of a story that I heard of a young
person becoming king soon after his father's reign.  I believe that this 
happened somewhere in the West.  Anyone recollect this story?

Carolingia is starting to have an increase of small children at events.  The 
ones that I have seen have been very well behaved, albeit a bit active.  (I
don't ever remember having that much energy!)  I noted that one who was about
3 or 4 was running around, but he was very careful to go around the rope
boundaries.  At that event we had a children herder, who organized informal
games leaving the adults to do their thing.  However, the adults did come back
on a regular basis to claim their children and some of the other people at the 
event came over to play with the children, helping the herder.  This system 
worked well, but I can see potential for abuses if each party is not 
responsible.

Also, at the Valentine's event in Carolingia in a court of love, the ladies
of an unnamed barony were accused of violating the rules of love, by doting
on two creatures that pretended to be babies.  One lawyer went into great 
detail about the cooing and affections that the women placed on these infants.
This case caused much laughter as there are two new small members of our 
barony, and one of them was walking around the stage with the help of his 
mother.  So you see, children can even influence the affections of the ladies
of an entire barony.

The opening date has changed over time; the last few years the opening date
has been the previous Monday, with the event running a week in length.  The
battles which originally were on Saturday and Sunday are now also on Friday.
The merchant's fair now runs at least that long. I remember one War where I
needed a new sidearm and found a high quality blade and a new scabbard made
to order in a few hours.

I remember one War when I arrived three weeks in advance (I live an hour
north and *commute* to the War) and I was # 37.  Todric (leader of the
Moritu (sp?) usually moves out in June.

Baroness Claire (the autocrat of this War) is probably going to go for
a system by which there will be some areas that can be reserved in advance,
with other areas up for grabs as in previous years.  I will be posting the
War rules in a few weeks, as the Princes of the Midrealm and the East have
just about finished their negotiations.

Message-ID:  <8903092250.aa19374@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

Chainmail making part2:

I actually got a reply or two to my posting about making chainmail with
questions so I thought I would answer those questions plus a little.

>Why did you recomend 14 or 16 gage over 12 gage?

You can make chainmail out of almost any gage.
The problems come when you need to make a particulare item out of mail.
If you were making earings, (which I have seen), you would want a very fine
wire (20 gage or so) and a small I.D.  (Interior Diameter) ring.

If you are making a flat piece for show, almost any size will do as it does
not need to be flexable or strong.

If you are making a shirt of mail, you need to choose a I.D. that is dense
enough to protect and also to "look good".  If the wire is too thin, the
shirt will break.  If the wire is too thick, then the flexable parts won't
flex.  

12 gage wire looks very good with 0.25in ID rings when it is for a flat
surface, if you are reducing though, the ring gets too crowded and bind.
Also, thing about how much room you are going to have for your pliers as
you are attempting to close a stubern link.

The first shirt I made was of 14 gage galvanized steel wire.  That is about
13 gage in actual size.  (They don't measure the galvanized part.)  It looked
very good where it was flat, but, where the arms meet the body, it bound badly.

Summary, 14 gage wire with a ring size of 0.25 looks good and does not have
binding problems.  16 gage is a little light for combat.  12 gage will bind
at joints.  All this changes if you use a larger ring.

>How do I increase or decrease?

The key to increasing or decreasing is to make a link that is 5 in 1.

	1 2 3 4 5 6
	 7 8 9 a b
	c d e f g h
	 i  j  k l
	m n  o  p q

In this case, link "j" is the link being used to decrease.  "j" goes UP through
link "n" and DOWN through links "d", "e" AND "f" adding link "o".  Link "k" goes
UP through "o" and DOWN through links "f" and "g".  Things carry on from there.

If you wanted to increase from a point, you could try something like:
	      1
	     2 3
	    4 5 6
	   7 8 9 a
	  b c d e f
	   g h i j
	  k l m n o

In this case, when starting a row, you would put two closed rings on an open ring
and thread the open ring through the left most ring of the preceeding row.

To decrease on the ends of the row, you would start with one closed ring on an
open ring and connect it in the normal way with the TWO left most rings of the
preceeding row.  On the last ring of the new row, "j" in the diagram, you would
just leave off link "o".


To increase in the middle of a row, you need to make a 5 in 1.

	1 2   3 4 5
	 6  7  8 9
	a b   c d e
	 f  g  h i
	h k l m n o
	 p q r s t
	u v w x y z

With this diagram, we are adding one extra link.  Open link "g" has TWO closed
rings added before threading UP through "k" and DOWN through "b" and "c".  At
that point, things continue in a normal fashion.

> How do I do 6 in 1?

	1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
	 9 a b c d e f
	g h i j k l m n
	 o p q r s t u
	v w x y z A B C

Looks about the same?  Well the diffrence is that link "9" goes up through rings
"g" AND "h" and DOWN through rings "1", "2", and "3" adding "i".  "a" would go UP
through "hi" and DOWN through "234" adding "j".  Things carry on from there in a
normal fashion.  If you try this with 12 gage wire and 0.25 ID, the mail will
be almost solid.

> How do I do 8 in 1?

8 in 1 is the same as six in one but you need to go back one more column.  Gets
very tight.  I have seen some nice 8 in 1 using 12 gage wire and 0.5 ID rings.
It was fairly flexable and very dense.

As a closing note, I said in my first posting, that one should use a metal
rod for winding springs.  There is a reason for this.  I used a wooden dowel.
The first spring went on just fine, when I went to pull it off, NOTHING.  It
would not budge.  Took the dowel out of the drill, and TWISTED the spring off,
all three hundred turns.  After about 20 springs, the dowel broke of in my hand
while twisting the spring off.  It took about an hour to rescue half the spring,
the dowel snapping off every time I got started twisting.  I ended up tossing
the other half away.

Questions about chainmail?  Please ask.  I will attempt to answer any questions
I receive.

Subject: children at events
Message-ID:  <8903092250.aa19376@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

I would like anyone's answer to the problem of what to do with children at
events.  Our local group is hosting a big event in July, and I am one of two
people running the arts and science classes, and my husband will be cooking
non-stop dawn til dusk on Saturday.  We have a small infant and no close by
relatives ot leave her with.  Our friends either work or are in the SCA too.
So, what do we do with an infant while we try to do the jobs we volunteered
for?  Other people have children, as well.  So far around here people seem to
either leave them with mundane relatives, or let them run lose.  Children
running loose is known as "Everybody will look out for them".

I've seen ads for events where other groups hired babysitters and people using
the service paid a fee.  I've seen free service where people dumped their
children and the babysitter got no relief from anybody all day and was trapped
with serveral abandoned children until she got fed up and went and dumped them
back with their fathers.  

We've been tossing around various ideas and NOBODY is willing to volunteer for
babysitting because they're afraid they'll never get a break.  We've talked
about sending security to fetch missing parents.  We've talked about all kinds
of things.  Nobody wants to be a hero.  So far all we've come up with is having
children's classes along with the adult classes.  This would give children
something to do and give their parents a break.  Has anybody else hosted
chidlren's classes?  What did you teach and how do it turn out?  Help please!

As the average age of Scadians gets older, there's going to be more and more
chldren.  Hopefully SCA will remain a family activity, but we've got to do
something to make it work.

I have nothing against children, (or for them for that matter) but I can not

child is being an obnoxious brat and they do nothing about it.  There is
nothing wrong with a 13 year old with a chest full of danglies even though
I have none, and I would not resent them for that, but a 13 year old with

I feel that this was not only rude, but somewhat dishonorable, now I'm 
relatively new in the SCA, so maybe my idea of what is honorable and not is
different than that of someone that has been around for a while, but using
the point of honor taken due to a misunderstanding of the conditions to your
advantage is not very chivarous. (Did I really write that as one sentence??)

Subject:      The SCA in general

Greetings from Branwen o y Gelli-Aur.

After reading a couple of articles this morning, I could not help but reply to
them ....

In the SCA I do Calligraphy and Illumination.  I also do various other things s
uch as costuming, dancing, and fighting.  When I dance at an event, I would not
 expect to be paid ... as I do this for sheer pleasure whether or not the
crowd watches, concerns me not.  I just hope that other people will join in, as
 the more, the merrier.  When I do up a scroll for someone's award, I do not ex
pect to be paid either, I do scroll's for fun (although it is nice to have them
 admired)   The question posed in another article, is whether armourers, and co
stumers should demand fees for their work...
Just recently I have had a young lady ask if she could commission me to make he
r a book of hours.  I still have to decide, but if I find that I do have the ti
me to take on such an endeavor, I will expect to paid for it.  You may ask how
I draw this line...
If I decided to do this work, and ALSO to enter it in a Arts and Science compet
ition, I would probably think twice about charging for it.
When I HELP someone make a costume, I wouldn't charge for it ... however, if I
made someone one, I would.  (I can say this because I've done it)
The difference between the scrolls, and the costume, is that the scroll is an a
ward to someone ... they didn't ask for it, and they more then likely don't kno
w the first thing about making a scroll ... and the question shouldn't even com
e up as to whether or not they should make their own:  it has been awarded to t
hem.
As for the costume ... if someone doesn't want to learn how one is made, they s
hould expect to have to pay for one.  And if this person neither wants help to
make one, nor wants to purchase one, they should seriously reconsider joining t
he SCA - as everyone needs a costume.  (Please DON'T take this as if I am sayin
g  never loan garb!!!  I always bring an extra set of garb to events for people
 who may need some.  And, being a student, I can well understand that some peop
le just cannot afford garb. - but that is a different issue then I am respondin
g to)

And as for children being in the SCA, and at events ... I can definately docume
nt that....

Message-Id: <2629@ncsuvx.ncsu.edu>

On the subject of mail construction:

- Sears Craftsman one handed bolt cutters are great for 14 guage
chainmail wire. I cut 2 *miles* of wire with one pair until
the spring that opens the cutters broke. I then took them back
to Sears and they gave me a new pair (Craftsman tools are 
warrentied for life)

- I have constructed one form of 6-in-1 mail that was a european
pattern. unfortunately I don't have any documentation for it anymore.
It was made of 12 guage, 1/2" inside diameter rings and weighs a *ton*.
The pattern is not like the oriental ones I've seen where some rings are
perpendicular to the body. Here everything lies flat as in 4-in-1. The format
(if I can explain it in text) is that the rings in each row all lay the
same way with each row alternating direction (as 4-in-1). For a given ring,
it will link with the rings directly above and below it, and the 4 rings
at the points of an X from it. That is there are 3 rings in the row above
and 3 rings in the row belo linked to it. The next ring in the same row
will link to 4 of the 6 used by the previous ring and 2 new rings.
This produces a very dense but flexible mail if large rings are used.
I tried 3/8" 14 guage rings and the mail was too dense to flex well.
I personally prefer the appearance of this style and I think that it would
provide even more protection that smaller ring 4-in-1 because of the 
increased ring overlap.

Message-Id: <11246@s.ms.uky.edu>



   Using an old posting brings up a good opportunity for me to 
complain here.  After our event the man-in-charge found two re-
actions from the populace.  One was something like "this is a 
lot of fun because I got lots of practice".  The  audience liked
to watch it and have their own levels of involvement.  The other
reaction to this mele was "Gee this is interesting but I can't win
anything this way."

This attitude really bothers me.  I mean, the whole point of SCA to
me is a hobby.  One has fun with hobbies.  I am don't feel bad for
those that didn't like our tourney because "they couldn't really 
WIN anything" I'm just amazed that mentality exists.  The whole point
to me, is to have fun.  If they're upset that they didn't win a prize,
then I'd rather not have them at our event.

Am I totally off base?

   As autocrat at an event in the middle kingdom just recently, I paid
full site and feast fees.  It wasn't a matter of status or what was right
but a matter of how much we were planning on and how much capital we had
to deal with.  The more capital we get, the more "freebies" we will allow.


   A side note on something that went reallywell at our event:

We had several people that came in without reservations despite the warning.
We didn't have much of the way of dining hall space so we created something
called a pauper's table.  We promised plenty to eat but possibly not all 
of the courses at their table.  I don't think this is an original idea but 
we had several people thanking us for doing such a thing.  Future feasto-
craters might like to consider this.  For that table, we charged half price.


Sorry this is such a late response but I've been very busy.

I hear rumors from time-to-time that SCA site fees
are volutary contributions, that is to say, they
are optional.  This seems a bit out of keeping
with my experiences in the SCA.  Can anyone
clarify this matter for me?

Message-Id: <89Mar10.130757est.5520@gpu.utcs.toronto.edu>

Michael Litchfield brought up two interesting topics in his
posting on letters of recommendation and children.
I'll break this into two replies for reason's of length.
 
Letters of Disrecommendation:  A poor idea, because they
always reflect on the writer.  I know one gentle whose SCA
career was ruined as a result, and another who is still
digging their reputation out of a tremendous hole.
 
Letters of Recommendation:  Ever since Skraeling became
a Barony, I have been cautious when writing
letters of recommendation.  Basically I write about
people that others have brought to my attention, or that
I have discussed with others who know the person's work.
(In other words, if I'm writing on my own initiative as I
often do, I take care to listen to other's opinions.  Sometimes
I have changed my mind as a result, but most often, I can make
a stronger case from additional information).
 
It is difficult to claim, as a Baron, that the letter one
is writing is merely personal opinion.  Barons are supposed
to be in one of the better positions to evaluate people's
work.
 
As a member of the peerage, when I respond to a poll, I believe
that the opinions I transmit are my own.
I still have a duty to listen to the opinions of non-peers,
and to make myself as well-informed on a person as I can.
If I feel that a person has or does not have "peerage qualities"
(see Corpora for a list) I will say so in a peerage meeting.
I am always conscious, however, that what I am saying is going
through my personal filter, and I make it a rule to say nothing
in private that could not be said, if needful, in a public forum.

One more hint for mail makers:

Our local master craftsman (you know the type, can build/fix/do anything)
made a mandrel to roll links and instead of a hole drilled at the end to
hold the end of the wire, he cut a slot in from the end of the rod with
a hack saw. This took longer, but when a roll is done, you simply pull the 
coil off the end of the rod without trying to cut the little wire bit
off first.

Just to give credit where credit is due, the person who researched and
got a large part of the canton started on mail making is Lord Magnus
of Elvegast, Atlantia.

Subject: Children with awards

There have been a few children in the SCA (younger than 15) with awards higher
than AoA.  In the instances I know of, the awards were richly deserved, the
result of years of service and expertise at a level that would shame many of
the adult members of the SCA.

I have rarely seen children disrupt an SCA event, and when they do, a quick word
from an adult usually solves the problem.  Children do add an extra measure
of realism to our game, and they make enthusiastic participants.

Parents have a special responsibility for teaching their children how to behave,
but not the sole responsibility.  One of the advantages of a small social group
like the SCA is that we care enough about each other to share some of the
work of raising children.  At many events, people with children take turns 
watching each other's kids.  In some areas, people with a particular love for
children volunteer to provide supervised activities for them.  Local offices
have been created to formally recognize the work these people do.

Let's hear no more of banning children from events!

Message-Id: <4460@pt.cs.cmu.edu>

I don't see anything wrong with giving a Maunche (or your kingdom's equivalent)
or a Laurel to someone who charges for his work, provided that the work is up 
to the usual standards, of course.  (A Silver Crescent or Pelican would be a 
completely different matter!)  My guess (not much personal experience here) is
that anyone who is doing something *mainly* for the money is not going to be 
overly concerned with authenticity (and thus not worthy of high-level arts 
awards) where as someone who is interested in the art *as an art* will pay 
attention to these details, and any resulting income is irrelevant as far as 
the arts award is concerned.

I have been a scribe for a few years, and regard this as a service to the 
crown and to the recipient of the scrolls.  As someone else pointed out, this 
is not a work commissioned by the recipient of the award.  I have received 
thank-yous (mostly verbal, one written) and one small gift (of paints) as a 
result of doing scrolls, and this is enough to make me happy. (It's the thought
that counts, and all that; if the recipient is pleased, I'm pleased.)  I would 
feel awkward if someone offerred me money after receiving one of my scrolls, 
just as I would feel awkward if offerred money for *any* gift.  Unfortunately,
there isn't much call for commissioned (by the recipient) work in some arts,
but money isn't the only reward for practicing an art.

One more example: as a musician, I relish the opportunity to perform at an
event (and look forward to the day someone specifically *asks* me to perform).
I don't expect to be paid for a performance at an event.  If, on the other 
hand, I wander off into a corner, set out a hat, and start to perform, and 
people happen to toss money into that hat, that's perfectly all right with 
me. :-)  BTW, has anyone ever seen this done at "normal" one-day events (as 
opposed to Pennsic and things of that scale)?  I might like to do this on 
occasion (only at events where merchanting is allowed!), but social convention
seems to be against it.

In short, arts awards should be given for quality and authenticity, and 
without regard to the income the artisan might derive from the art.  Not all 
arts are created equal; some don't offer many income opportunities.  This 
doesn't mean that those who do the "monetarily rich" arts should stop charging,
or that those who do the "monetarily poor" arts should start, and it certainly 
doesn't mena that you shouldn't be able to get an arts award unless you give 
away all your work.

For this event, you may well want to consider either hiring a
 babysitter and leaving your small one at home, or
contracting with one of your SCA-friends with small ones to watch
her for you all day. (Something on the order of, "if you'll mind
Awildasdottir while I run the A&S, we'll pay your feast ticket.") I
remember one absolutely disastrous Twelfth Night that I autocratted
some 8 years ago, when my daughter was 6 mos, when my husband
finally took the baby home and started calling sitters because we
made the mistake of trying to look out for her while we worked.
[thank goodness for previously pumped breast milk!] While you
autocrat, you want someone guaranteed to watch the little one so you
don't have to worry whether you're either imposing on someone else
or not doing your appointed/volunteer task. If you start now you
will be able to work it out before July.
 
I'm one of the world's biggest proponents of children (well-behaved
children -- I rag on about wild rug rats as much as anyone) at
events, but there are times when you have to realize the committment
you've made means the kids need someone else to look after them.

The system which has worked best at our events (and, I confess, I
set up the arrangements because I was autocratting and couldn't
afford the time to watch my child, who is now 8 1/2 and not in need
of lots of supervision) is one where we hired a pro caregiver (one
of the women who works at the school after-hours care program). We
charged $1 per child per hour (that's what she said she'd work for)
and guaranteed her a minimum of $50 for the 8 hours the daycare was
open during the day, and a minimum of $45 for the 6 hours it was
open after the feast. The other catch was this: no parent could drop
off a child unless he/she guaranteed to spend at least one hour in
the daycare room. We had 18 children at the peak, and 3 adults and
one pro for every hour the service was open.
 
If a parent didn't show up for his or her duty hour, the Troll sent
someone looking for him/her. (we used a signup sheet.)
 
The advantages of this were:
   1) The person who was in charge of the daycare room was prepared to
      spend all day, and most of the evening, minding small kids. That
      was what she agreed to do, and that's what we paid her to do.
 
   2) The provider gave us a list of project materials and arts/crafts
      supplies for a variety of age groups. (our barony now has a
      kids' box that has glue, scissors, construction paper, and a
      bunch of other supplies, that we can have ready for events to
      help keep the kids occupied.) We made suggestions for more
      "period" sorts of entertainments -- what sorts of games came
      from in period, etc. The kids also made a "tapestry" -- a 20
      foot sheet of 3ft paper on which they drew a castle, a battle
      scene, a kitchen, etc, and which they presented to the royalty
      at dinner that night. It was a blast for all involved.
 
   3) Parents only had to commit to one hour of daycare per day, and paid
      for the priviledge of having the other time off. That meant we
      had the resources for quality care, instead of having to
      scrounge for volunteers.
 
Some other things we did with the kids during the day:
 
    1) We served a snack mid-afternoon, and we had a rest period for
       the kids under 5 after lunch. parents could pay an extra $1 and
       get their kids lunch (bread, cheese, fruit, and fruit drink.)
 
   2) We had an afternoon and a morning "recess", where the providers
      and some hardy parents took the kids outside to the regular
      playground nearby and let them run loose. (we were very lucky
      in both sites we did this at.)
 
Yes, this took a lot of organizing. It was worth it, however, for
the good time the kids had, and that the parents, particularly folks
who were both in classes or teaching or in meetings or fighting,
were able to have. And I think the kids did enough "period" sorts of
things to make it different than just being in nursery school all
day long.

I'd suggest you contact Lady Caroline de Mercier, the Middle Kingdom
MOA-to-be. (actually, she may have already started her job...) She's
run some of the best children's classes I've ever seen at events. If
you don't have access to her address, let me know and I'll send it
to you. Another person with great ideas for Children's days is Duke
Sir Talymar, who regularly hosts a "kiddie-con" were the kids are in
2-hour classes and come out with projects to show for it.
 
Don't despair! There are lots of valuable resource people around,
and tho it may take someone being a martyr this time, it will soon
be a habit in the group to consider child-care and kids' classes as
par for the course.
 
Good Luck! (and congratulations!)

Subject: Re: Chainmail
Message-ID:  <8903101752.aa14673@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

Hello All,

A few people have pointed out some problems with the methods I
described in making chainmail.  Here are the responses.

> In doing research on armor, I never saw 6 in 1 or 8 in 1, where
> have you seen "period" 6/8 in 1 chain?

I have done almost no research an chainmail other than talking to
other people, some of whom have done research.  What I have been doing
is looking at ways to link little rings together.  My opinion is that
6/8 in 1 chain would be very unusual in period.

Most chainmail from period is of soft iron rivited together.  As such,
it would not need to be very dense to stop a thrust (the rivit would
do that).  At the same time, a slashing blow would be stopped and the
energy transfered to a ganvasan without need of the density of 6/8 in 1.

In the SCA, I like to use the denser patterns for places that get hit
with BIG sticks too often.  The denser patterns are less likely to loss
links and they absorb energy better, spreading the engergy over more
links.  Also, if you are using larger sized rings, a six in one pattern
is not much slower to knit than the four in one style giving a better looking
mail with less (?) work.  (12 gage 4 in 1 with 1/2 inch links does not
look real good, 12 gage 6 in 1 with 1/2 inch links pretty good.)

> Using an electric drill to wind springs is danagerous!

Yep, you are right.  Use leather gloves, where eye protection when
cutting links, etc.  Any time you use a powered tool, you are doing
something danagerous.

I use an electric drill because I don't like to spend hours winding
springs.  I generally wind about 20 springs of three hundred links
every two weeks.  It takes me about an hour with the drill.  With
a hand winder about five hours and a stiff shoulder, plus I would have
to look out for the kick back from the handle if it ever slips.

Please be careful however you wind your springs!

> Making "chains" then linking those chains together is faster and
> easier as you don't have to be able to count.

When I first started making mail, I tried the "chain" method, I found
the chain method to have a few draw backs.
	1) It gets VERY crowded when linking the chains together.
	2) For every link that you add to the cloth, you need to
	   close two other rings.
	3) You need to count the links in the chains.  (I suppose that
	   it is possable to just make a long chain and link it in a
	   spiral to the cloth)
	4) If you use chains that are "hanging down" you need someplace
	   to hang them.

With the method that I described, once I get past the first three columns,
I don't need to place the "cloth" on a table.  I never count the rings
being added.  I have a bucket of open rings and a bucket of closed rings,
to add a link, I take one of the open rings in one hand slip a closed ring
on with the SAME hand, do the threading process (which comes automatically),
then holding the link up supporting part of the cloth, pick up a pair
of pliers with the free hand and grip the open ring,  pick up the second
pair then close the open ring, set down left pliers, grip cloth with left
hand, set down right pliers, pick up open ring with right hand....

I am not very fast because of the type of wire I use, but it only take about
3 hours to add four hundred links the my current shirt, that is cutting,
opening, closing and weaving the cloth.

When I was using "cheap" wire, it only took about an hour to add 540 links
which was one row on my first shirt.

> I use the midget bolt cutters to cut rings, they work fairly well.

I tried bolt cutters but was not real pleased with them.
	1) I had difficulty getting the nose of the cutters into
	   the spring.
	2) I had problems getting the cutters open one handed.
	3) I don't like the cut I get with diagnal cutters.  I prefer
	   the flatter (no points) cut I get with shears.

I keep hoping that I will one day be able to run a laser cutter on
a spring and see what happens. :-)

Greetings! Here are comments on some recent postings.

Letters of dis-recommendation:

I agree with Michael Litchfield that letters saying "this guy should not
be rewarded" would be a very slimy and unfriendly thing to write.

On the other hand, it is important that really unworthy creeps don't become
peers or acheive honors they don't merit. I don't believe that a negative
answer to a polling letter, perhaps even stating reasons, would be wrong.
After all, this is the reason why the higher orders have the polling system.

Michael Litchfield writes:

"A tug of war between lace an no lace are usually fun (esp for the no-lace).
 Insult competitions are great. Tall tale telling is fun for both the partici-
 pants and the audience. Caber tosses are fun if you have a fair number of
 scouts about."

Please explain to an ignorant Swede: What are "lace and no lace"? What is
meant by "tall tale telling"? What is a "caber" and how do you toss it and
what has it got to do with scouts?

Alphonso De Kay writes:

"First of all, to our slightly misled collegue, William de Colbie, I have a
 friend (...) who, not only is a direct descendant of the original Norse God
 worshippers, but her family still keeps the traditions and observances as
 much as they feasibly can in this day and age. Not only that, but the complex
 lore that you alluded to is being passed down intact, so that "after the time
 of Loki" proper observances can begin again"."

With all due respect, and with my best efforts to keep an open mind for that
the impossible can sometimes happen, I am still absolutely convinced that
your friend's claims are false. She may be a direct descendant of the original
Norse God worshippers, but then so am I and a lot of other Scandinavians. That
proves nothing.

Let me assure you that my views here are not based on religious prejudice
against paganism, but on my knowledge as a theologian and a historian. If
there was such a thing as a living branch of the old Norse religion, with
a tradition that had been handed down essentially intact from Viking times,
that would be a scientific sensation. (I personally think that it would be
absolutely marvellous and very interesting!)

But no such thing is known to science. The living remains of Norse religion
are traces that can be found in Scandinavian folklore, mainly a few very
old superstitions. But such things as spitting when you see a black cat
does not constitute a religion.

In fact, most of these modern pagan groups have been examined thoroughly,
both by sociologists and historians/theologians, and the result is exactly
what I previously stated: no matter how they perceive themselves, they are
*not* adherents of the ancient Norse religion. I don't want to burden the
readers of the net with an extensive discourse about this, but I assure you 
that it is perfectly possible to prove that Viking religion, as a historic
phenomenon, is *extinct* and has been so for a long time.

"Norse" pagan groups have appeared from time to time. There were large frater-
nities of "Odinists" in Germany from the 1890s to the 1930s. They found that
Norse paganism contained ideas that were easily compatible with modern ideas
in their society, e.g. Nietsche and the nazi ideology. Some of the less 
racist of these groups still exist in Germany. Today, several Norse pagan
groups are active in Scandinavia. Their religion contains some environmenta-
lism, magic and a lot of shamanism. They are in contact with North American
Indian groups who have similar ideas. But neither the Germans nor the modern
Scandinavian groups claim any such thing as being a surviving wing of the
ancient Norse religion. They are quite aware of that they are trying to
re-create something out of the past.

It is typical that those who make such fantastic claims are Americans. In 
Europe, most new religious sects and groups have been dissenters from
existing religions in the current society at the time of their foundation.
But in the USA a lot of sects have appeared without such direct descendancy,
perhaps as a result of the greater disparity of religion in the americas?
Many sects and groups in America have popped up from nowhere, as it would
seem, often with claims of direct divine revelation (e.g. Mormonism), in
other cases with other more-or-less absurd claims concerning the nature of
their group.

It is a typical and well-known phenomenon that such new religions often claim
great antiquity. Ancient origins give respectability and credibility in a
society where people are awed by Old Things and where many are looking for
some sort of roots, having lost their true history. Who would believe in
Joe Smith's Newly-Invented Religion? It is far better to be The Ancient
Temple of Horus and have the air of mystery that surrounds ancient times.
Being party to Secret Teachings of the Ancient Egyptians, or whatever.

I'm sorry if the truth hurts, but Viking religion is dead. If you can prove
that it's not, you will create a major upheaval in historic science and
become the most famous discoverer in our century! But I doubt it.

Yours truly, William de Corbie

Komban wa,
  Rather quiet around the rialto between midterms and spring break and such.
So here is a question. Is it honorable to send a letter of dis-reccomendation,
that is a letter where you specifically reccomend that a given person not be
given an award?
    Personally I find this a particularly slimey course of actions. It is a 
petty and underhanded method of trying to hurt someone. There are always people
who get awards that we, in our own personal opinions, do not think they 
deserve, but the better answer is to write letters of reccomendations for
people whom you think DO deserve awards.
   Also, when writing a letter of reccomendation, if you are an officer or
other "official", and you are expressing your personal opinion should you
include a disclaimer? The place I work here requires me to include a disclaimer
in any e-mail I send to a public forum.

 Other questions:
   How much emphasis should be placed on children in the society? Recently in
Ansteorra there has been a lot of push for more attention to children and
children's activeties. The crown created a group called "pages" which are
children who go about the crown's business and are to be treated as such. There
will be an upcomming edition of the kingdom newsletter devoted to articles made
by children. I find that I feel some resentment toward this attitude. It has
always been the case that most members of the society have joined sometime
between the ages of 16-20, such new members are the heart of the society.
Attention should be payed to children but it should be remebered that they are
not the major source of new blood to our group. (besides it is disheartening to
have to deal with a 13 year olf brat with chestful of danglies where you
haven't got many.)

The part of events I enjoy most are usually the non-organized parts. I really
enjoy in the late evening to sit around a fire, singing non-period (usually)
songs, talk, hear old SCA stories, hear about different things, drink.

    As far as organized activeties, try old classics. A tug of war between lace
and no lace are usually fun (esp. for the no-lace). Insult competitions are
great. Tall tale telling is fun for both the participents and the audience.
Caber tosses are fun if you have a fair number of scots about. Axe throws are
neat. Most physical events tend to be outdoors type of things though.

Subject: Anyone in this kingdom read this?
Message-Id: <346@sequoia.UUCP>


Lord, Ladies, and good Gentlepeople all,

I would like to ask you if there are subjects of the Kingdom of Ansteorra
reading this group?  It would seem that almost all of the postings that I
have encountered have been from beyond our kingdom.

The reason I am asking is that I am contemplating setting up an archive
and with some irregularity offering copies of the archive to my local
Barony and/or the Crown.  However, I don't want to step on any toes doing
this, nor would I like to go through this to find out that all this is
already being sent to them and I'm simply adding to their load.

I haven't approached the Crown or the local Baron yet with this, since I
would first appreciate hearing from those who might know of reasons not
to follow through on this course.  Also, frankly, I'm a bit shy of this -
the vast majority of my interactions with the Society have been through
the Barony of Stargate, not my local one (Bryn Gwlad), and I'd rather not
make a total fool of myself with folks that I don't know too well yet
(yes, somehow the net is different.  Even friendlier all too often).

On that parenthetical note, let me also add my thanks to the person who
posted the article on 'newbies' recently.  Because of my occupation and
the hours I work, I can seldom attend events.  The first few I attended 
I did feel much as was described in that (initial) article.  Luckily I
have also found some good people, again mostly from Stargate, that don't 
seem to mind that my attendance is irregular or that I don't fight - they
instead make me and my lady feel welcome whenever we are able to get away.

My thanks for bearing with me.  All feedback is appreciated.

Well, after I took a deep breath and relaxed (I have gone through
the years when there weren't any children, much, in the Middle and
those with Children got many nasty things said about them, and have
been enjoying the maturing of our society into a more
family-oriented group), I wanted to respond to this gentle's
comments.
 
Milord, perhaps it is true in your part of the world that "most" new
members are between 16 and 20, but the national/international
demographics don't support this. In fact, we've had to do some
canvassing for the TI advertising director, so that he can prepare
some statements about our group for potential advertisers. We are
getting older. (average now more like 28 than 20.) We are getting
richer (more of us are in career employment). We have more children,
more cars, more expensive toys.
 
Milord, the people on the west coast who have been in the SCA
forever pointed out to me when I was there that they are into their
3rd generation of SCA folk, and those children who played page in
the early days are the autocrats, organizers, and new peers of this
day. We need to encourage this trend toward service (and, yes, we
need to encourage it in adults, too...)
 
I think you need to consider carefully whether or not your own
feelings in this matter (expressed in the last paragraph of your
posting) are clouding your judgement on this issue. It's taken a
long time for the rest of the Known Worlde to accept and integrate
children into our Society routines, and I for one welcome the
change. It gives me more freedom at events to show up with a
middle-sized kid (who usually gets drafted to peel veggies, run
errands, and do little chores they can't find an adult to do) and
(soon, I hope, o lord, soon!) spend time doing the things *I* need
to do, infant in tow. With the advent of child-care at events, all
parents can have some time purely as an adult and some time "paying"
for that freedom by granting it to others.
 
I shan't rant on.
 
Regards,
   Siobhan

Subject:      more chainmail

Greetings unto the Rialto:
To add a small note on "chain" mail --  while making the pattern by
working out from a patch is truly a viable method, it does require
concentration (one must count to four many times...) there is a
method that only requires counting to one (!) for atleast half the
time -- to wit: initially, make open rings as previously described.
Then, (ta-da) make chains !!! Yes -- long chains.  Then lay out 2
chains, and taking up single open links, weave the two chains together
so that the pattern emerges as desired.  Add more chains, etc, etc.
The great advantage to this method is that half the work can be done
while completely iniebriated -- and there is a semantic satisfaction
as well as the reward of seeing much progress immediately to making
"Chains".

Subject: More on minors at Pennsic

Thanks to all of you who responded to my query about bringing minors to Pennsic.
Jonathan's going to be bummed out, but at least he has a couple of other things
to look forward to on his 18th birthday.  (It's a shame, really, but he'll deal
with it.)

In SCA Digest #269, Lord Aeldred Aethellystan (Ethan R. Dicks) presented his
opinion on whether restricting unaccompanied minors at Pennsic had improved
things any.

I don't really agree with you, milord, but your posting does show another
example of what I find most lamentable about the SCA today: the fact that
mundane law has intruded so much into our doings that we're forced to cover our
behinds, even while trying to re-create an era where none of that existed.
Whether "we" brought it on ourselves because a few people failed to exercise 
simple common sense is another story.

Also, the restrictions may have cut down on the percentage of minors roaming
around on their own at Pennsic, but you forget that the ones who came in with
their parents may have just as sincere a desire to go wild as those who came
alone, or with older friends.  You'll still find 16- or 17-year-olds who want
to party all night and drink Scotch and get into all sorts of situations.  The
fact that these people had adults to get them in is almost immaterial.

(insert heavy sigh here) Checking IDs at parties.  Insurance thugs.  Lawsuits.
The IRS.  Number tags at the door.  More insurance thugs.  It sometimes makes
you forget what you came in for.

Message-Id: <Mar.9.11.30.47.1989.5214@vanhalen.rutgers.edu>

Greetings, good gentles.

My lord Michael, you raise some interesting questions.  The matter of
children in the SCA has arisen in many Kingdoms.  I know that at least
some Kingdoms (An Tir, East, probably others) have Kingdom officers to
deal with such problems.  Your statement about the ages of most of the
active members of the SCA is probably correct, but married couples,
with children or planning children in the near future, are making up
more and more of the SCA population, and it would be foolish to ignore
that trend.  

Children who have been properly integrated into the SCA generally turn
out to be exemplary members.  Their knowledge of everything from court
etiquette to dancing tends to be more thorough, and more natural to
them, having been learned so early.  In fact, in most cases I know,
these children also end up well-adjusted, happy, and productive in
general, contrary to common expectation.  I personally think that this
derives from their interacting with adults who are playing.  They
learn when it is right to be silly, and when it is necessary to be
serious.  They learn to distinguish fantasy from reality, and how to
enjoy both.  I find children (in most cases) to be a valuable part of
the SCA, and I applaud those who are willing to make an effort to help
them join our Society.

Good cheer!

	Arval.

Subject: "6-in-1 mail"

Not meaning to be disrespectful to Dougal McKinley, I'd like to see some 
documentation for his claim of 6-in-1 and 8-in-1 European mail.  I did some
research into mail construction a few years back (including visiting about 10
armor collections in England in Germany, and looking at the mail they had
in storage).  I saw no evidence of any structure other than the standard 4-in-1
construction on any armor from Europe or the middle East.  I have seen his
"oriental mail" on Japanese armor, but I'm not sure of the dates.

Museum-quality mail is almost all riveted, except for Turkish armor, which is
often butted.  All real mail that I've seen is of much lighter construction
than the standard SCA mail, but the riveting may make it resist cutting better.

Dougal's construction technique is common, but not necessarily optimal.  I have
only made two haubergeons, so cannot claim to be an expert on construction
techniques, but I found it far faster to build vertical strips of mail, then
join them, rather than adding on a row at a time.  

Also, there is no need for the dangerous electric drill technique. 
It is almost as fast and far easier to control a hand-cranked mandrel,
not to mention more authentic.  Simply put two right-angle bends in a steel
rod to form the crank, and stick the rod through a couple of hardwood supports.
Drill a hole in the rod for starting the wire.  If winding the wire by hand is
too tedious, forget making mail---winding the coils is less than 5% of the work.
The hand-cranked mandrel has the advantage of being reversible, making it easy
to correct a mis-winding.  Always wear a leather glove when winding coils, to
avoid injuries to the hand.

I found that a pair of mini bolt-cutters worked well for cutting rings, as they gave a 9-1 ratio without being so long as to be unwieldy.
Unfortunately, the jaws failed from metal fatigue after only 50-60,000 cuts.

At one time I was interested in making riveted mail, but ran into two problems:
	I didn't have the expertise needed to design and build the tools.
	I couldn't find wrought iron wire (mild steel work hardens too fast).
Does anybody have any suggestions?

Subject: What is the real status of 'waivers'?
Message-Id: <350@sequoia.UUCP>

[This article is crossposted because the issue has come up either directly or
indirectly in most of the groups.  However, it is not the central issue for
most of these groups.  Those interested should followup to misc.legal, where
further discussion is directed.  Thank you]

In quite a few areas of activity anymore, we are asked to sign 'waivers' to
participate.  It is not at all clear to me what these waivers accomplish.

First case in point:  For 10 years I taught SCUBA.  Both the agencies I was
accredited by required that all students sign a standard waiver in order to
be allowed to take the class.  It was the rare class that didn't have someone
read it and ask if it didn't absolve me and/or the dive shop of all of our
responsibilities toward safety.  Many people expressed reservations about
'signing away their rights'.  On several occasions I had opportunities to
discuss this with senior people in the certification organisations and was
told two things: "It's to cover our ass, we have to have it" and "You can
tell the students that it doesn't really waive any rights, it simply informs
them there are potential hazards".

I am interested in other activities (not as an instructor or whatever) that
also have similiar waivers required.  I have run into this in rock-climbing
classes for example.  I have also seen a waiver involved in SCA participation.

Is there any real info available to (legal) laypersons like me that would
clear this up?  Do any of the lawyers on the net have any input they could
give?

Thanks in advance for any information.  Again, if you are interested in this
topic, please follow up to misc.legal - this is a peripheral topic to some
groups but should be in the 'mainstream' for misc.legal.

Subject: Children at events
Message-Id: <4446@pt.cs.cmu.edu>

I think part of the problem that some groups have with children is that not
all parents feel oblidged to modify their behavior when they show up with a
kid.  We've had some very well-behaved and helpful kids in our group, and 
these kids are a valuable asset to any group. Unfortunately, we've had some 
that are not so well-behaved.  Part of the problem in this case is that 
sometimes parents show up with kids and just assume that someone will look 
out for them; they don't watch the kids themselves, or try to share this
responsibility with the other parents.  The problem is not so much with the 
kids as with the parents.

It is very frustrating to have your court/performance/whatever ruined by
kids bawling at the tops of their lungs for minutes on end.  It is also 
frustrating to have your meetings or events disrupted by kids chasing each 
other around the room at top speed until they drop from exhaustion.  And
it is very *dangerous* to have kids running loose near or on the tourney 
field.  (Marshalls: how often do you look *down*?)  And consider all the 
opportunties to get in or cause trouble that exist at large events such 
as Pennsic.  Yet all of these have happened from time to time because the 
parents haven't accepted the extra *responsibility* that goes with bringing k
ids to events.  I don't think the burden of taking care of the kids should 
fall on everyone else who shows up at an event.

Most parents aren't this way, of course, and it would be a shame to punish
all for the sake of a few.  (Especially since, when parents cooperate, the
SCA can be a major positive influence on a child's socialization.)  But for 
those who are this rude and/or negligent, what is the proper way to handle the
situation (assuming it's a chronic problem)?  Should the autocrat, seneschal, 
or officers ask the parents to take the offending kids home?  (Probably a bad
precedent -- "You annoy me, so you'll have to leave."  And how would you 
modify your answer if the offending parent was the autocrat, seneschal, other 
officer, or from out of town?)  Should all kids be banned, to avoid singling 
people out?  (Bad move, in my opinion.)  Should we all bite the bullet and 
live with it, as the society slowly generates more and more children?  (And 
the potential problems get worse and worse....)  All of these options have 
big problems.  Any suggestions?

By the way, as far as "danglies" go, I've *never* seen a kid get an award
higher than an AoA.  Some kingdoms have orders for children (Tyger's Cub in
the East, Dragon's Gem (???) in the Middle), which I think are non-armigerous,
but I've never, for instance, seen a kid with a Silver Crescent (Eastern 
service award).  Kids have only a limited range of activities available to 
them, between their age and their resources.  (They can't fight/fence/scout, 
arts can be expensive, they can't hold offices....)  It's possible that there
are kids out there who haven't been adequately recognized for what they do,
but I don't think you need to worry about "13-year-old brats with lots of
danglies" (as Flashback put it).

Message-ID: <890310010942.16.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

Greetings to the net!

(Warning: the notorious Lord William is about to stir things up again...)

There are one or two things that people absolutely must have in order to
function in the SCA. Everyone needs medieval garb, and fighters need armor.
None of these things can be bought at the local supermarket, so we either
have to make them ourselves or ask someone in the SCA to make them for us.

Those who make armor or costumes for others expect to get paid for their
work (unless they are personal friends of the recipient). Most of us think
that this is OK. We might not think that it was OK for an armorer to charge 
for *teaching* armoring, but he can charge for *making* armor, right?

But consider this: Let's assume that you receive the Order of the Quivering
Jello. You take the promissory scroll to the local calligrapher, but he says:
"Sure, I will teach you how to make a scroll." You happen to be totally un-
interested in this particular art, and not very talented, but you still want
a scroll, so you say: "But milord, I can't do calligraphy! It would take
years to learn!" And the scribe replies: "Well, if you want me to, I can make
you a really nice scroll for 50 bucks."

Or consider this: What if you are having a reve and the musical ensemble in
your group demand money for entertaining? Or what if there is a very skilled
dancer in your group, and you ask him/her to put together a dance piece for
the revel, and he/she demands to get paid?

It is not unlikely that you would disapprove of these things. After all, the
SCA is supposed to be a voluntary organization, and you're supposed to do
these things because it's fun and because you want to learn.

I am *not* trying to say that charging money for any specific thing is right
or wrong. But I would like to know what all you people out there think about
the role of money in SCA activities.

What is fair and right here? The skilled calligrapher, dancer, musician,
armorer or seamstress all have their work admired at events. They will all
get their Laurels if they are good enough. But some of them also get paid
for what they do, while others are expected to do their work for free.

You may argue that sewing and armoring are always done for individuals,
while dancing and music benefit the whole group. But in that case, perhaps
we should ryward those who buy and *wear* nice garb and armor, because they
are clearly contributing to their group - while those who sew and hammer are
only working for an individual and thus don't deserve rewards. After all, they
are not doing it for fun but for money.

I would like to ask your opinions on this. If someone charges for his work,
should this mean he is disqualifying himself from receiving orders and/or
becoming a peer for his work? Why do some people get paid and others not? Is it
right to charge for teaching outside your own local group? Should there be
extra merit in working for free?

	Greatings Gentles all.
I beg of your forgivness for bending your ear once again to the (to some) dis-
turbing subject of religions.  First of all, to our slightly misled collegue,
William De Colbie,  I have a friend (actually our relationship is: she is a 
teacher for my father in a small college north of here, but I still count her
as my friend) who, not only is a direct decendent of the origional Norse God 
worshipers, but her family still keeps the traditions and observances as much
as they feasibly can in this day and age.  Not only that, but the complex lore
that you alluded to is being passed down intact, so that "after the time of
Loki"  proper observences can begin again.  Her name is Birgetdottir.  She has
never heard of the SCA, and I would be doing her a discourtisy by mentioning it
to her, for we do not understand her ways and she would think our ways are 
mocking her beliefs.  In her religion, it is forbidden to say the name of Thor,
unless you are a properly ordained priest, for only the priests know at what 
time He isn't listening or isn't about to bring His great wrath down apon them
all.  To reinact a blot would not only be in poor taste (it is very impolite'

to kill a guest even if you knew the proper manner), but it probably would have
one of three effects.
1)If the religion is just a "bag of words" then you would have needlessly
  wasted a life for a few moments of entertainment.  (Following this tradition,
  a few of my Roman friends might wish a christian to get better aquainted with
  a Lion for their entertainment, and we can't escalate that way)

2)If we stipulate (as my friend does) that the religion is true, and ALL of the
  forms weren't met precicely, the "executor of the service" (pardon the pun)
  might find them self on the wrong side of a God's wrath.  Even the Christian
  God might take objection, and certanly the Jewish God, for in the first com-
  andments does it not state that they are Jelous Gods?

3)If again we stipulate that the religion is true, who should be slated to be
  the vessle of the invoked God, knowing that when the service is over, they
  will belong totally to the God, and MUST do the God's whim?  Any volinteers?
  There are several chores in the wings (such as a Jihad, the defeate of the 
  Giants (computers?), thwarting of Loki (world press?) and several other
  monumental tasks.)

As to the pagans (dirty word why not call them polythists?)
As to the polythists, what they do with the power that they have raised isn't
as clear cut as what a Christian must do, so they have taken steps to see that
such power is controled and seperated away from those that it could inadvert-
intly harm.  This is why if a "group demo" seems silly, is probably because
a)it is low level enough to be safe in case of accident
b)it is missing some major parts
c)it is fake.
I am sorry I took your ear for so long, but I felt that there should be a
greater sharing of knowlege, for prejudicies are evil and that is the only
way to avoid them.  After much research, I hope that I have said enough and 
not too much.
Regretfully yours (on such a painful subject to some)

Greetings from fionnghuala (finna)

I have been making cordials for about a year now, and
they  have been fairly well received. my problem has been
finding period sources for recipes. I made one recipe from
Sir Hugh Plat's book _Delights for Ladies_, it called for
macerating "rosemary, marjoram, sage, fennel, orange and/or
lemon peels in spirits of wine" (spirits of wine being described
earlier as more or less brandy). This ends up tasting like
a version of gin. What I had been making was more like
crushed fruit in brandy or vodka and adding honey for sweetness.
Did they make these sort of sweet cordials in period?
I've heard that Benedictine and Amaretto di Saronno are
period (both are sweet). Can anyone direct me toward
sources? Period recipe books seem to have only foods and
wines. I have access to any books in any library via
inter-library loan, and can go into NYC, Phila., DC or
if necessary Boston if anyone knows of something neat in
a rare-book collection.

thanks!

As I understand it, milady, the problem is thus:
 
Pennsylvania does not accept "temporary" guardianship papers, only
court-appointed guardianship papers. This means that the waivers,
"letters of appointment", lawyer-drawn rights of guardianship, and,
most importantly, parental waivers of permission to treat minors at
Pennsylvania hospitals, which people have been assuming would work
for years now, are all invalid.
 
The Coopers' insurance company, who would be one of the first in
line to be sued should a minor be seriously injured and then not be
able to be treated at a hospital, has put this restriction on the
Coopers. I suspect that in ordinary weekends, if a family comes in
with an extra teenager, the Coopers look the other way, but for the
month that Pennsic encompasses, the number of people, and, (sigh)
the litigious nature of some SCA participants, they have to be
strict.
 
I, too, find this restrictive, as it means I can't find a babysitter
to come with us to Pennsic anymore. AS charming as college-age folks
are, most of them find other entertainments at Pennsic, and don't
want to commit themselves to a week of helping babysit a 9 year-old
and a new baby.
 
However, especially given that the Coopers have faced suit at least
twice for problems with minors, we have to play by their rules if we
play in their court.
 
I remain, in Service,

Onto all who would listen to the ravings of a Saxon dog, Eadred
Aethellystan gives greetings.

I am, fortunately, old enough, where I was never barred from Pennsic
because I was under 18, but there are several members of my local group
who are not old enough, and, conversly, I have dealt with this issue.

I think the point rasied earlier is a valid one: What about the Boy
Scouts?  When I was a minor, to go on any field trip, local or otherwise,
no one was permitted to go *at all* without a  signed parental permission
form.  When I camped with the Boy Scounts, we all had hospital release forms
in the possession of the adult-in-charge.  Without the form, we stayed
home!  While I am from Ohio, troop did go outside of Ohio on tripes, including
a hike in the cranberry bogs of Virginia (without me, thank <insert your
deity here>!).  I.e.  OUTSIDE the jurisdiction of Ohio laws.  Did that mean
that if we had gone to Pennsylvania instead of Virginia or Kentucky that
we would have been SOL had any Scout needed medical assistance?  Did our
scoutmaster needlessly endanger us for taking us far from medical assistance?
Do Boy Scouts meet in Pennsylvania?  Do they leave the state to camp?

How are minors at Pennsic different than other groups of minors traveling
without their parents present?

I am not necessarily upset at the ban of minors at Pennsic.  I was 18 years
old at my first war, and had been in the Society for over one year.  I didn't
suffer needlessly for missing what could have been my first Pennsic (no money,
no equipment and no ride).  I have noticed a change in the character of the
War over the last few years, since they have begun the new minor restriction.
I am not sure that it is not a change for the better.  I know people who
actively check IDs of young ladies before offering alcohol or such things
to them, to reduce the possibility of accidently corrupting a minor.  As I
recall, he has been presented with more than one fake ID, proving that
you cannot be too sure.  It is a different set of penalties, however, serving
liquor to someone under 21  instead of someone under 18.  At least with
a ban on unaccompianied minors at Pennsic, the risk of unknowingly committing
statutory rape or corrupting a minor is lessened.  It is not a pleasant
suprise to find out that your companion of the evening is not 19 or 21 or 22,
like you thought, but that she is only 17.


I remain,
Eadred Aethellystan

Subject: "honor" stuff
Message-Id: <MY5Ppmy00WE5M1ekcP@andrew.cmu.edu>


     It seems that the discussion of the "point of honor" is fading away, and I
wanted to put my two cents in before it was too late. Worthy things have been
posted.  Such as Henry of Maldon says in his 4 Mar msg. "... tries to make the
fight as fair, safe, and comfortable as possible for all involved..." We can add
fun to that as well. I am sure that there is no question about these things
being honorable conduct. The "point of honor" business, however, can sometimes
be percieved as unfair or rude. Master Kobayashi provides the essential solution
to the "point of honor" business in his 27 Feb msg.  If all parties involved
communicate and understand one another no one should be offended.

     What remains to be dealt with, in my opinion, is the term "point of honor"
itself. The 2 Mar msg. by Diego Escalero mentions the serious definition of the
term. I feel it ought to be reserved for that sort of usage, lest the term be
weakened by abuse. The SCA usage is inappropriate, unless we accumulate "honor"
points like Dungeons and Dragons experience points to be cashed in for a funny
hat or some such. I would offer here an alternative term. "Self Dismemberment"
doesn't sit quite right with me, although it is certainly to the point. I have
used for many years a term of my own devising, that being "the Chivalry
Schtick";)

>Here follow two egregiously unecessary examples:

1)     At the end of a melee, someone (guy I know who wins a lot) had slipped
and finished off his opponents from his knees, then he rested. From the other
side of the field, the sole remaining opponent (looked like a large Man With A
Mission) came galumphing up. He immediatly whacked himself in the legs and went
to his knees. Guy- looks at him funny, gets up and steps back, whereupon large-
looks pretty funny too. Now large- is at a disadvantage and guy- uses it to
thrash him soundly. As I witnessed this I was satisfied that the chivalry
schtick was intended in this case only as a crowd pleaser to improve the image
of the user. This was definately rude to the other fighter.

2)    During a tournament one (guy I know better who wins less) gets the leg of
another. It was a fun fight, and would be sad if it were over so soon. The one
with the advantage disengaged, waved one sword and put it behind his back. Note
that he did not whack himself. The two then fought for a long time. Disengaging
again, the one meditated upon the tournament. It was huge. Grand Weapons
Proficiency has all fighters in 5 lists (the 5 weapons forms). It would be rude
to those who wait, as well as not so much fun anymore, if the fight went on much
longer. The fighter brought back his unused sword arm and waved both swords at
the kneeling opponent. Satisfied that they both understood that the fight was
again on unequal terms, he finished the fight. Afterwards I suggested to the
losing, de-legged fighter that he was too good to be beaten by a user of the
chivalry schtick, and he was being honored as a superior fighter.

     On more than one occasion I have similarly honored knights in melee by
ganging up on them.

Oh BOY!  A chance to talk about something I LIKE to do!!!

Warning, the following is a 200+ line example of what happens if I start
giving instructions on anything..... :-)

Having been making chainmail for over two years now, I think I can give
you a reasonable answer :-).

1) I have seen only one book on "how to make chainmail", but I have not been
   looking for books. And, I can't remember the name of the book.
2) There are a number of diffrent methods of making mail and there are diffrent
   types of mail you can make.

So how do you make chain mail?
It is very easy actually, you need a few tools and alot of time.

Start by getting the following tools:
	1/4 inch steel rod  (or something a little larger but less than 3/8 inch)
	3/8 inch electric drill, variable speed, reversing.
	two pairs of pliers, I have a pair of craftsman line pliers and a
		pair of craftsman "normal" pliers.
	one cutting tool.
		I use a pair of channellock No 308 heavy duty wire cutters,
		these will cut almost any wire but deform the rings slightly.
		A pair of diagnal cutters will work but it takes much more work.

Next you need some wire:
	For practice and experamenting get some "Bell" wire in 16 gage.
	(almost any electric supply store, don't worry about the insallation)
	For normal mail, get some galvanized 14 gage steel wire, I don't
	think that 16 gage is SCA legal for combat armor.
	(Go to a farm supply store, they have such wire for fencing)
	For good mail, I use .0640 half hard 304 stainless steel.
	( I have to look up my supplier but they only sell in 50 pounds
	or more lots)

	For fun, get some .0640 inch spring hardend phosfored(sp) bronze.
	( Again, I need to look up my supplier, these people sell by the 
	coil which is about 12 pounds)

Now, you need to make springs, to make springs:
	1) Put the steel rod into the chuck of the drill.
	2) make sure you have a free running end of the wire, a second
	   person can make this much easier.
	3) Stick the end of the wire into the check next to the steel rod,
	   if the wire does not fit, you will need to drill a small hole
	   through the rod and insert the end of the wire into that hole.
	4) SLOWLY start the drill, holding onto the drill with one hand and
	   guiding the wire with your other.  I hold the drill with my left
	   hand with my pinky on the trigger, my right hand guides the wire.
	   The wire should wind onto the rod looking like a screen door spring.
	5) Holding onto the sprin and drill some distence from the end, cut the
	   wire.  Remember that the spring is under tension and will spin the
	   sharp end VERY fast.  If it hits you, it WILL cut you.  (I do have
	   scars from this.)
	6) Slide the spring off of the rod.  If you drilled the small hole, you
	   will have to cut that end also before the spring will slide.
	7) repeat from step 2 until you have a number (>3) of springs.

Now, you need to make some "offset" rings.
	1) look at your springs, they should look something like this:

		////////////////////////////////
	    ___////////////////////////////////
	2) Using your cutters, cut one side, keeping as close to the last
	   cut as possable.  You will end up with some thing the looks like:

		_
	       / \
	       |
	       \_/
	
	   The opening will not be that large and it will be offset, looking some
	   thing like a lock washer.


	3) For a shirt of mail, make 33,000 of these links, for practice, 39.

Now, you need to make closed rings.
	1) using your pliers, close 24 rings.  Make sure that the ends are butted
	   together.  Looking something like:

	       _
	      / \     |
	      | |     |
	      \_/     |

** This is called butted mail, if you welded each link closed, it would be welded
   mail, if you rivited each link closed, rivited mail.  (If you were making rivited
   mail, you would use a slightly larger ring, flatten the ends, over lap the ends,
   drill a hole through both ends, then drive a rivit through the closing the link.)

Now, you need to make open rings.
	1) using your pliers, open 15 rings.  The rings need to be open enough
	   to allow you to easly slide closed rings onto the open link.


Now, you are ready to make chain mail.  Chain mail comes in two basic forms and
with a number of variations.  There is European mail and Oriental mail.  The
Oriental mail is easier to make but not as good at stopping thrusts.

The European mail comes in the variations of 4 in 1, 6 in 1, and 8 in 1.

I am going to describe how make 4 in 1.

Take one open link and four closed links.  Place the closed links on the open
link and then close the open link.

Lay the pile on the table, the pattern should look something like.
	 _ _
	/ X \
	|||||	This is the top two rings, over lapping each other.
	\_X_/	left ring on top of the right ring.

		The bottom two rings should look the same.

		The middle ring (the one that started open) is on top of
		the left two rings and under both right rings.
	The middle ring should look like it is pointing in the opposite direction
	of the top and bottem rings.

Pick up an open ring and place TWO closed rings on it.
Hold this in your right hand.

pick up the five rings you just put on the table in your left hand being careful
to preserve the pattern.

Take the open ring in you right hand and thread it UP through the BOTTOM RIGHT
ring in your left hand then DOWN through the TOP RIGHT ring.  Close the open
ring around the four closed rings.  (Two you pick up from you closed pile and
two from the first set.

Lay the pile on the table and arrange so that the pattern looks like this.
	 _ _ _
	/ X X \
	|||||||		You now have a top row of three rings over lapping.
	\_X_X_/

In the top and bottom row, it should look like a row of dominos that have been
pushed over.  The center row should look the same but going in the other direction.

Repeat the last step until you have SIX rings on the top and bottom rows.

** If you look at the center row, you will see that each ring goes through four
   other rings.  Each of the top and bottom rows go through two rings.  The four
   rings through each one ring is were the "4 in 1" name comes from.  When you add
   the next row, each of the bottom rings will have two more rings linked to it.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Adding the next row.

Lay the pile on the table and arange it as before.

Take one open ring and place two closed rings on it.

Thread the open ring DOWN through the bottom left most ring AND DOWN through the
bottom ring right next to the first.  Close the open ring.

You should have a pattern that looks like

	1 2 3 4 5 6
	 7 8 9 a b
	c d e f g h
	 i
	j k

Rows "123456", "cdefgh", and "jk" "fall" to the right.
Rows "789ab" and "i" fall to the left.

You are going to added another two rings to this pattern.

	1 2 3 4 5 6
	 7 8 9 a b
	c d e f g h
	 i A
	j k B

"B" is a closed ring and "A" is an open ring so prepare by putting one closed ring
on one open ring.  THIS IS THE NORMAL THING THAT WILL BE HAPPENING.  Everything else
has been designed to get you to this point, in knitting, the precedding steps would
be called "Casting on".

Take the open ring (A) and thread it UP through "k" and DOWN through "d" and "e" then
close the open link(A).


	1 2 3 4 5 6
	 7 8 9 a b
	c d e f g h
	 i A C
	j k B D

Repeat with C going UP through "B" and DOWN through "e" and "f".

At the end of this row, the pattern should look like:

	1 2 3 4 5 6
	 7 8 9 a b
	c d e f g h
	 i j k l m
	n o p q r s

You will then start the next row.  To add a new row, start as you did with ring "i"
and string the open link through "n" and "o".  When done, you will have a total
of 7 rows.  3 rows of 5 (15) + 4 rows of 6 (24) for  total of 39.

Each of the following rings should connect with four other rings,
"789ab defg ijklm".  The corner rings connect to one other ring and the edge 
rings connect to two other rings.

Once you have done this, let me know and I will describe how to do "6 in 1" and
"8 in 1".

-----------------------------------------------------------
Oriental Chain Mail

Oriental mail is some times (incorrectly in my opinion) called "6 in 1" the pattern
looks some thing like:

		O---O---O---O---O
	       / \ / \ / \ / \ / \
	      O---O---O---O---O---O
	       \ / \ / \ / \ / \ /
		O---O---O---O---O
	       / \ / \ / \ / \ / \
	      O---O---O---O---O---O
	       \ / \ / \ / \ / \ /
		O---O---O---O---O

Each "O" represents one ring with six other rings connected to it, each
"---", "/", and "\" represents one ring with TWO other rings through it at
right angles to the "O"s.

Have Fun.

Yours in service,
Dougal McKinley

Message-Id: <1303@hjuxa.UUCP>

greetings from fionnghuala siobhan nic an chlerich (finna)

is it considered "religion at events" to have a choir 
singing a sacred song? so many of the songs that are
period are religious, that it is hard to find a good 
procession song that is not. being non-christian, i got
used to singing about jesus' birth and so forth around
holidays, and when i was in regional state choirs, quite
a bit of the music we sang was sacred. 

having been at an MSR coronation last year, where religion is
much more a part of the atmosphere, i experienced a pseudo-
mass as part of the ceremony. the "priests" and so forth
came down the aisle of the church (the event was in a
unitarian cathedral of some beauty) with incense and chants.
i had been warned, so was just a bit disturbed. the woman
sitting with me, however, kept saying "the goddess isn't
going to like this" (in persona!). Most people who were there
were not offended. they knew what to expect, religion as part
of the daily way of things seems to be part of what split
the MSR from the SCA. I didn't like having it be an integral
part of the show, and I don't go. 

i certainly wouldn't mind seeing religion at events, and in
part of the atmosphere, tapes playing, lenten dishes, etc. but
as the central focus of an event, no. let's have such things
in side rooms, or other places where those who want to do them
can, and those who don't can opt out. i do think we could have
more religion than we do now. not one SCA event i've been to
(othere than pennsic) has had any religious options.

Dani states:

I am still having a problem with that one and I have yet to have anyone
show me proof that the restrictions on treating minors is a point of
Pennsylvania law.

How do groups like the Boy Scouts go on week-long excursions without every
parent accompanying their child?

I understand the Coopers reasons for the restrictions although they do not
make me happy (a case of one irresponsible person spoiling the event for
everyone).

I am in a similar situation as my Lord and I have a 17 year old friend who
travels to SCA events with us a lot.  She has been in the SCA for 5 years,
has her Award of Arms and recently became a member of the Queen's Order of
Courtesy.  We promised her that she could attend the War when she turned
16, since she would have been in the SCA long enough to know what to do at
such a large event.  She turned 16 and found out she couldn't attend
because of the new rules set down by the Coopers.  It is a shame that a
long standing member of the SCA cannot attend one of the biggest events of
the year.

Oh well, this is an argument that I have been having for two years now and
will probably have for at least another year.  Unfortunately, I doubt
anything will change.

Hi All,

Although I am not a member of the SCA, I was wondering if someone could answer
a question for me.  Does anyone out there know of any good books on how
chainmail was made? Is it primarily a bunch of metal rings interlaced in some
sort of a patern?  If so, what is the pattern? Is there more than one way to
do it?  Thanks for any info you can give me.

Subject: Falconry et al.

Greetings,
        I do not know of any falconry guild, but I am aware of mundane laws
covering falconry.  Many, if not all birds used for this are either endangered
or protected species.  I would suggest contacting the Fish and Wildlife Service
(or local state/gov't group) for regulations concering licensure, etc.  I also
seem to recall hearing that one must serve an apprenticeship with a registered
falconer and/or take a detailed exam before becoming a full-fledged (sorry,
couldn't resist) falconer.
        Concerning the live steel discussion:  I'm surprised no one mentioned
the Markland Militia, a non-SCA group that routinely does choreographed live
steel demos.  They have strict certification policy for those who wish to
participate in such.  Of course, the Markland view on live steel use has
alwasy been one of the major differences between that group and the SCA.
        Still, they *do* manage to use it safely.  It's all a matter of
training.
        Finally, for those who wish to expereince the joys of the medieval
church or monastery, why not set up an experiment (off the beaten path) at
Pennsic?  If handled in similar manner to the 'Enchanted Ground' as per Duke
Sir Cariadoc of the Bow, it would be enjoyable & interesting.

Subject:  Households (brief); Steel; Religion

Greetings!

I haven't had time to offer any comments lately, but have been following the
various discussions with interest.  I would now like to add my 2 pence here
and there.

HOUSEHOLDS:  I agree with much of what's been said, both positive and
negative.  Households are very much a two-sided coin.  I would add only, if
you are in a group in which a single household is causing trouble for the
group as a whole, try to get the situation dealt with by the group as a whole.
Hopefully, working with the Seneschal and/or resident nobility (in the case of
Baronies) might help accomplish this.  Otherwise, you could all end up
miserable.

STEEL AT EVENTS:  I was told soon after joining the Society (and have in my
turn taught to others) that pulling steel at an event, except for purposes of
showing it off or controlled "performance" condidtions, was one of the few
things that could get you tossed out on your can.  Certainly, it would lead to
yours being a *very* unwelcome face!

From what I've been reading, 2 things have become apparent:  first, were the
idiots (mentioned in the original posting) running around with drawn steel
part of the show or not?  It seems to me that it is possible they were not,
that it was a case of "spontaneous participation."  In which case, some sort
of action is warranted; this sort of behavior is careless, irresponsible, and
dangerous in the extreme.  Second, I think just about all of us realize this.

Both in Meridies and Trimaris, the passing on of the Crown by a hokey
assassination of the Sovereign and Consort is just about traditional, and is
probably the most frequently-used ploy.  Bared steel *rarely* appears however,
best as I can remember.  Usually, either the Sovereign, the Consort, or both
are "abducted," and the "bloody corpses" later "returned," "recovered," or
"discovered."

One anecdote I can't resist including (and a good example of an intelligent
use of bared steel as a part of the show):  after having slain her husband,
good King Laurence, Queen Ana of Meridies was dragged out of the hall by the
guards.  Following them quietly was the "Executioner" (marvelously played by
Sir Bronislaus of Vilnius, dressed all in black with a half-helm hiding his
features and boots _with_taps_on_the_soles_), who bore a *LARGE* double-bladed
axe.  As the Populace sat in the hushed hall, a scream and a *thunk!* was
heard without.  Then the Executioner re-entered the Hall, and silently walked
its length ("Tap, tap, tap..."), wiping his axe with a bloodied rag all the
while...

Trimaris Kingdom Law has long included clauses regarding the drawing of steel
for show:  basically, you are required to make sure there is enough room and
to say "Clear!" in a loud voice.  Steel is to be kept scabbarded, *with a
"peace tie"*, at all other times.  This is to reflect the general recognition
of the need to handle steel in a responsible manner, and to give an autocrat
some kind of bureaucratic backup in case of trouble.

RELIGION:  we can rant, rave, and in general discuss this topic all we want,
but like it or not it's an area of the SCA in which mundane law intrudes.  The
key words to keep in mind (as I have said before) are "forced" and "required".
One can neither be _forced_ nor _required_ to be either a participant or a
spectator in any religious anything under mundane law.  This is why the SCA
simply _cannot_ afford or allow any religious undertaking to be presented as
being _officially_ in the Society's (and therefore the Corporation's) name. As
a non-profit organization, any inference (accidental or otherwise) of
religious affiliation could cause problems. This does not bar its presence
altogether.  One must simply take care as to how, and under what
circumstances, things of a religious connotation are presented.

For example:  if there is to be a wedding, simply invite everyone to an
otherwise private ceremony.

Or, say someone is to be knighted, and they want an authentic medieval
Christian knighting ceremony.  That's okay, for 2 reasons:  one, anyone who is
not a participant in the ceremony is _ipso_facto_ a spectator, and not directly
affected; two, any spectator who doesn't care to watch is free to leave.  As
long as the individual being knighted has the ceremony he/she wants, who
cares?

By the way, this last applies to the "just passing by" scenario mentioned
recently (by Lady Malice, I beleive).

It is when coercion becomes involved that problems might arise.  However,
there are myriad ways of avoiding the problems, so why worry?  So long as
everyone is respectful of others, we'll be okay.

However, there _is_ one aspect to all of this which we must keep in mind and
be careful of.  Apart from the usual concerns about being thought of as a
cult, I would remind one and all of the recent presentation(s) of the Society,
specifically, in a negative light by such sensationalist programs as "Unsolved
Mysteries."  WHATEVER your opinion on the topic of religion in the Society,
now is a time when we must be very careful of our public image.  Our position
could become all-too-precarious!

I wanted to leave this section completely intact.  As you noted, it is, how
do they say? volatile?   However, while I might not completely agree with
your opinion on the matter, I am terribly impressed with your tolerance and 
respect for other viewpoints.  A question tho, Is it not possible that some
teachings might have survived handed down generation by generation?  Pagans
refer to these as "Fam-Trads" or Family Traditions....

Nicholas was Bishop of Myra.  He was well known for his charities; in one
case he provided a dowry for two young women (who could not get married
without them, condemning them to a life of even greater servitude) by
tossing gold coins down the family chimmney.  Myra is a city on the
Mediterranean coast of Turkey; it was hard to get to in the 60's when
I lived there.

Harrumpf!

	In mediaeval times, the pageantry, pomp, and circumstance were
(rightly0 seen as the _essence_ of the Mass, and nobody before Luther
would have understood the arguement about "menaingfullness" and "true
belief" being necessary to the licitness of a Mass -- properly ordained
and licensed clergy, yes, but the audience was supposed to be impressed.

	In period, too, the Mass was taken very lightly -- read some of the
impassioned sermons of various reformers, imploring people to be more
respectful, and refrain from gambling, fighting and fornicating in church
whilst the Holy Scarifice of the Mass is in progress!

	As an ordained Old Catholic priest, I whould have absolutely no
objection to a "theatrical production" of the Mass, complete with
vestments, incense, and preaching, done by (un-ordained) actors, _SO LONG
AS IT WAS SO LABELED, AND SO LONG AS IT WAS ACCURATE IN PORTRAYING WHAT
WAS DONE AT SUCH A MASS IN PERIOD_.  I _would_ have difficulty with a
parody, either out of stupidity or malice, which portrayed the Mass as a
subject of ridicule or japery.

	I will confess to having some trouble with Leonard Bernstein's (sp?)
"Mass" and the modern Roman Catholic worship service, but then I _am_ a
bit of an odd traditionalist . . .

- - - - - -

	On the subject of modern worshippers of Thor (Odin, Tir, Jupiter,
Isis, et tedious cetera), if they _say_ that they are serious in their
worship and that the subject of the worship is Thor, who am I to
disagree?  The fact that they are _worshipping_ at all, and not just
standing around making snottily supercilious remarks about "outmoded
superstitions" I regard as a good sign.

	A very good case can be made that the God worshipped in modern
churches bears no resemblance whatever to the God worshipped in the 1st
Centuries B.C. and A.D., and that there can therefore be no such thing as
"true Christians" any more -- sheer bushwa, of course.

Message-Id: <QY4NBxy00Uw-E6eV9T@andrew.cmu.edu>

To put the problem into perspective, the ruling against minors not accompanied
by their parents or legal guardians has nothing to do with how responsible or
well behaved said minors may or may not be.  It also has nothing to do with the
presence or absence of someone willing and able to take legal responsibility for
those minors.

If some accident or misfortune should cause a minor to wind up in a hospital,
the law will not allow that hospital to do anything without the parents'
permission.  Court appointed guardians will do.  Temporary guardians will not.

So we're up against a point of mundane law which makes the restriction, if not
(in the larger sense) reasonable, at least understandable.

I'm curious as to the distribution of faiths in Sweden.  In the US, *everyone*
is in the minority.  Out of fifty states, their are forty-nine in which no
single faith can claim a majority of the population.  The sole exception is
Utah, which is over fifty percent Mormon!  This situation gives rise to a
cautious attitude towards public religion.

I welcome this attitude, but I'm not sure it's coherent.  There seem to be three
major stances which can be taken towards other people's religions.  There are
those who think that other religions are harmless bunk, there are those who
think that other religions are harmful bunk, and there are those who consider
other religions to be valid paths to a common set of goals.  (The same three
stances, with appropriate variation, can be found among people with no religion
of their own, but I'll skip that for now.)

The second of these stances is probably the most honest of the three.
Certainly, if I belonged to a religion that taught that anyone not of my faith
faced an eternity of damnation I would consider any other faith to be harmful
indeed.  I would equate someone's choice of such a religion to be morally
equivalent to a child's choice to walk onto a bridge I knew to be unsafe, and
would act accordingly.  It is notorious, however, that when people with this
bent achieve the political power to back these beliefs, things get unpleasant.
Sufficiently so, in fact, that the expression of such opinions is not
politically acceptable.

Those who think that other people's religions are harmless bunk have no real
stake in doing anything about it, and will tend to keep such opinions to
themselves so as to avoid giving insult.  However, since the presence of people
who take them seriously makes the enactment of religious ceremonies more than a
game, it is understandable that people with this bent will prefer religion to be
safely sidelined.

As to the third stance, that other religions have a validity equal to one's own,
my personal judgement is that there are a reasonable number of people of this
bent, but that they are the smallest of the factions.  Still, this is the public
stance which is least offensive to those most likely to take offense, and so it
is the public stance of choice.

I seem to be describing a massive public hypocrisy here, but that is not my
perception.  Rather, I would say that on this subject, circumstances have forced
us into a politically mature position:  Recognizing that we can't have what we
want in a domain which we consider very important, we've chosen the compromise
which seems to do the least harm.

>The intention of my first posting about religion was only to suggest

It's not clear that there are any harmless ways.  I agree that it is somewhat
illogical to wish away so large a portion of the middle ages, and that it would
be nice to be able to act differently without ruffling any feathers.  But just
as a family may have topics which are never discussed because raising them
invariably leads to a fight nobody wants, I'd say the SCA is stuck with the need
to relegate public expressions of religion to the same status.

William de Corbie sends greetings and warns easily-offended people to
skip this posting since it contains highly intolerant and stuffy things...

Word explanation: A "blot" (pronounced "blooot") is the Norse word for a
Viking sacrificial ceremony.

I was not aware that the word "cult" was so hot. It seems to have unpleasant
connotations. Okay, GLOBAL REPLACE "CULT" -> "RELIGION".

I'm not challenging the legitimacy of any religion (though I may sometimes
challenge the truth of their teachings - for instance I might do that
if there was a religion which claimed that the moon is a large cheese). As 
long as there are people who believe in a deity, this deity should be treated
with respect even by those who think that it only exists in the imagination
of the believers. When I talked about the present-day "Norse pagans", my
intention was not to question their sincerity or the legitimacy of their faith.
I was only saying that their religion is *not* a continuation of the Viking
religion. This is not an evaluation, nor a religious opinion, but a statement
of scientific facts as I percieve them.

Any serious study of the subject will reveal that modern knowledge of Viking
religion is extremely limited. 90% of its myths and beliefs have been lost in
the mists of time, and what we have are some fragments which have been handed
down to us by Snorri and other Christian writers.

The present-day "Norse paganism" is a newly-invented, modern religion which has
borrowed some terminology from Viking religion. I am not familiar with the
American branch of "Odinism", but I have read some papers on the modern pagans
in Iceland, who presumably are similar. Their religion seems to be a mixture
of environmentalism, shamanism, feminism and humanist philosophy.

The point I was making is that if modern paganism and real Viking religion are
two entirely different things (which the Icelanders at least seem to be
aware of), then why would the modern pagans object to a theatrical re-creation
of a Viking ceremony?

On the other hand, facts about what modern "Norse paganism" truly *is* may be
beside the point. It is perfectly possible that some American flavor of modern
Norse pagans *perceive* themselves as really belonging to the actual Viking
religion. This belief then takes precedence over facts when determining my
attitude.

With all due respect, (*WARNING! EXTREMELY RUDE, INSENSITIVE AND OFFENSIVE
WORDS AND OPINIONS FOLLOW*) I personally regard any such claim as nonsense 
(the same kind of nonsense that the Freemasons use when they claim to be
connected to the medieval cathedral builders, though *in fact* they are a
secret society founded in the 18th century). From a rational point of view,
any claim of belonging to a religion which has been totally extinct and
virtually forgotten for at least 600 years, and of which only faint traces
can be unearthed by the most skilled scholars, is bullshit.

But if, as somebody suggested, the "Odinists" think of themselves as belonging
to historic Viking religion, I still think that we must respect this delusion,
and abstain from rites that would offend the persons in question.

Perhaps this is just an academic point, but I think there is a *vast* diffe-
rence between how modern "Norse paganism" relates to real Viking religion and
how modern Christianity relates to medieval Christianity. I *do* belong to the
medieval church! I preach every sunday in a church that was built in 1290 and
has been used continually ever since then. On the wall in this church is a
scroll where I can read the names of my predecessors who served in this church,
all the way back to the Middle Ages. I use a chalice from ca 1350. Occasionally
I wear a (gorgeous red velvet) chasuble from ca 1470. My creed was formulated
in the 4th century. The liturgy goes back at least to Chrysostomos, and in
parts to Jesus Christ himself. There is virtually no difference between the
mass I celebrate every sunday and the mass that was celebrated here when this
church was brand new, except for the language. I hold an office which has been
handed down in an unbroken chain of ordinations, as far as anyone can tell,
from St Peter to the present day. Face it, people, this is still the same
religion.

The intention of my first posting about religion was only to suggest some
*harmless* ways to make religion a bit more visible in the SCA. However, the
level of bewilderment caused on the net by my postings suggests that these
things are more complicated, at least in the American setting, than I had
expected. The number of (for me) totally unexpected misunderstandings of what
I was trying to say suggests that this is indeed an unsolvable question, and
that it might be best to continue keeping religion invisible at SCA events.
Religious questions seem to provoke a lot of reactions from you Americans
that I would never get here in Sweden. I am in fact rather taken aback by
the hornet's nest I seem to have stuck my head in. Or, to use another metaphor,
I am probably in over my head if I try to debate this issue on the net.

As Lady Marian Greenleaf writes: "...we need to tolerate a fairly wide range
of private (and probably low-key) religious activities at events" and "In terms
of the SCA,I would rather see us mostly ignore religion in our *official*
doings (as is by and large the case, than tear ourselves up over it..."

I agree. This is probably the best course, even if it leaves us with an
incomplete and crippled version of the Middle Ages. It's better than being 
at each other's throats over religious misunderstandings and the fine points
of religious freedom all the time. <sigh>

With sincere apologies to all those I may have offended and whose holy beliefs
I may unwittingly trodden upon, I remain yours,

William de Corbie

     I didn't suggest any such thing.  I only suggested that one might
OFFER to defend the king, in such a way as to force the choreographed
violence to stop.  AND, in spite of what this person suggested in an
earlier posting about my suggestion, I only think that it would be right
to interfere when one has good reason to believe that the audience is not
entirely safe, which would mean that the separation between performers
and audience has already broken down.  Perhaps I did not make this fact
entirely clear at all times in my previous posting, but I did say it.

     Also on the topic of coronations, I would like to mention that I
think that it would be wrong for a knight, or anyone else who has taken
an oath of fealty, to support a "Sovereign" who staged an armed rebellion
at their Coronation, unless it has been announced in persona that it is
only an act.  In fact, I am seriously thinking of finding out more about
how the last few coronations, and also the upcoming one, have been / will
be done, so that I can know who I ought to acknowledge as my rightful
Sovereign. ;-)  If there's going to be an armed rebellion at Coronation,
it would be a very good idea for an official announcement to be made in
Court to the effect that this is an act presented for the entertainment
of the crowd.  At the same time, people could be advised that live steel
should never be used in this manner except by experts who have practiced
their routines many times before presenting them in public.

>However (as Jeremy says) if the autocrat doesn't like the way things are going

     This is the responsibility of anyone who sees a serious violation of
the usual rules concerning the safe handling of live steel, regardless of
whether they're "'in' on the plan."  If people are charging through the
crowd with drawn swords, or waving weapons within a foot of the crowd, you
stop them even when they're only using tournament weapons.

Subject: Public vs. private "honor," and winning
Message-Id: <74241ABC102@PSUVM>


     You'd think that after all the times I've gotten upset upon seeing
others try too hard to prove a point, I ought to know better.  Oh, well...
     I'll try to stick to relatively sound and rational arguments this
time.

     It seems to me that public self-dismemberment is an easy way to
convince (some) people that you, like Brutus, are an honorable man (or
woman).  It gets a high return for a relatively small investment.  As
has already been pointed out, losing a limb in SCA fighting doesn't
necessarily put you at any disadvantage.  And even if it does, you
only get a chance at a so-called "point of honor" in some fights, and
not in others.  And I have also questioned whether it is really the
right thing to do.  After all, I don't see that there's anything wrong
with giving your opponent an opportunity to "come from behind" to win.
If you're going to spot your opponent an equal number of points each
time you score, then it's silly to keep score at all.  Just take back
any blow which is not killing.  Maybe then the legal target should be
the head and torso only? ;-)
     Also, there are many other things which are undeniably honorable,
but which call less attention to themselves, such as accepting blows
even when you're the only one who can tell that they're good.  This,
in my opinion, is the only way that you can really make a distinction
between more and less honorable fighters: the things that they do when
they don't expect people to notice.  If a fighter always takes a good
blow when he/she feels one, never hits too hard for safety, always
circles a "grounded" opponent (if necessary) so the sun won't be in
their (the opponent's) eyes, never tries to bring enemy scouts into
range by begging for water or medical assistance (a very reprehensible
and dangerous practice, if anyone does it), and in all other ways tries
to make the fight as fair, safe, and comfortable as possible for all
involved, then that fighter is VERY honorable and chivalrous even if
he/she absolutely refuses to practice self-dismemberment.
     As for winning, it seems to be fashionable to think that wanting
to win is dishonorable.  This makes sense as a reaction against the
attitude that "winning is not the only thing, it is everything."  But
I think that it is yet another case of splitting a hair in the wrong
direction.  The thing which is important isn't not wanting to win, it's
not wanting to win except by eminently fair and honorable means.  And
furthermore, it is my belief that hardly anyone really isn't interested
in winning, because winning is a major emphasis of the way most of our
tournaments are run.  In a many tournaments, you don't even get to play
if you lose.  Anyone who really believes that it's not good to want to
win ought to be boycotting all those tournaments in which only the
winners get to play, and maybe even the ones where only the winners get
prizes, or the winners get better prizes than the other participants.

Subject: Atlantian Archer Awards
Message-ID:  <8903030000.aa13505@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

Can anybody tell me anything about archery in Atlantia?  I haven't lived here
very long and so far I haven't been able to turn up anything except a rumour
that there is some kind of kingdom officer for archery, but nobody knows who it
is, or even whether combat archery is allowed here.  I'm trying to overcome
local inertia about archery and get an archery group formed, but I'm
handicapped by the lack of information. I'd  also like to know if Atlantia
offers any kind of recognition for archery.

 Recently somebody described confusion over an archery award that went
armigerous, non-armigerous, active and inactive. It points out the need that
the SCA needs to more organized.  So far we're a small enough group that we can
get along on custom and habit, but the bigger we get, the more need there is
for some overall policy to cope with new situations as the Society evolves.
This in the medieval period was known as a Code.  Basically what it does is
spell out the philosophy and general terms of law.  specific laws are referred
to the code to see if they support or conflict with the stated principles

The matter of awards might be handled thusly: The purpose of the Society is to
disseminate information about the Middle Ages to members and interested
persons.  In order to encourage and support this purpose, awards are
established.  In particular, A non-armigerous award shall be given to recognize
achievement in any medieval art, science, or service.  For truly outstanding
achievemnt of long duration,  an armigerous award shall be given.

It would then be the duty of each kingdom to decide what they would call their
awards, and how they would pass them out.  Personally I favor a reasonably
simple system.   Awards for service, awards for arts and sciences, awards
for martial arts. Awards already exist for all three of these categories,
 but they are not of equal value, and not all subject have been defined to
 be the province of one area or another.  Archery and fencing are left out,
 as are period bare handed fighting, black powder, strategy, and seige engines.
  Yet these are all done by people in the SCA who spend a lot of effort doing it. 

I will agree that this need for recognition is a modern one, belonging to the
Society, and does not reflect an actual medeival situation.  So I am willing to
concede that using knighthood as the award for everybody in the martial arts
is stretching it a little far.  I'm willing to leave knighthood as the
exclusive province of the rattan fighters IF people who fight with other
weapons and styles get an equivalent recognition.

And much to everyone's relief, I am willing to admit that this is a dead
subject as far as the Net is concerned.:-)

The East has a new Earl Marshall, Barak Sir Carthalo (sp? - no Pikestaff
here) since the Kingdom Twelfth Night.  He clearly bears no responsiblity
for anything that might have happened before his taking up of that office.

I am  not familiar with East Kingdom practices, but in the Middle all of
the dramatic action that accompanies the accession to the throne of a new
King is the responsibility of that person.  It must clearly be safe and
consistent with mundame law, Kingdom law, and Corpora, but there is great
latitude here.  The point is that in the Middle responsibility for such
actions would reside in the King, with the Earl Marshall advising.  I know
that some kingdoms define the area in which the Earl Marshall can act as
the list area, melee field, battlefield, or practice yard; actions in
court would be the responsibility of the Crown and the Kingdom Seneschal.

I have a memory of the "I read it somewhere but I can't remember where" kind
of a men's undergarment called the paltock.  This vague memory says
it is something like a sleeveless vest, who's sole purpose in life
was to provide a place to hang hose.  Since I'm tired of the "too
sleek" look that Mssrs Danskin and Capezio provide, I'd like to
wear more correct period hose - the Italian doublet and hose I've
got are very comfortable.  Does anyone know anywhere that discusses
or shows patterns/examples of the paltock?  And while we're at it,
I'm interested in correct men's undergarments too.
Thank you all in advance.

Subject: minors at Pennsic?

His Oriental Highness Morguhn and His Mediterranean Highness Palymar have
already signed a document specifying the rules for Pennsic 18.  Here's what the
document say about minors:

    "No one under the age of eighteen (18) will be admitted to the war site
unless they are accompanied by a parent or legal (court appointed) guardian.
Minor's waivers and temporary guardianship papers will no longer be accepted.
Minors who arrive without parent or guardian will be sent home immediately via
the person who brought them, parents will be called to pick them up, or they
will be sent home by bus at their own expense.  Individuals who try to
circumvent this ruling, which was established by the Coopers, will be charged
with trespassing and appropriate action taken.
    No one under the age of eighteen (18) may participate in any combat/
fighting activities at the war.
    No one inder the age of eighteen (18) may participate in combat related
activities such as scouts or waterbearers. 
    Archery has no age limitation save those within reasonable safety
standards."

well i'm still confused.  
A demonstration of a mass would go something like this:
	choir-sings something unintelegible in latin
	person taking part of priest-says something unineliglble in latin
	person taking part of priest says, "here the person taking the part
of the priest picks up the cup and recites the following:"  etc.

somehow that wasn't what i had in mind either.

If i understand what is being said correctly, a person is being forced to participate
in a religious service if they need to walk by it on their way  somewhere else.
and somepeople would be offended if they even knew it existed. this doesn't 
sound reasonable.

I agree that we shouldnt make broad assumptions about anybodys religion, but
for *most* medieval people christianity was not a pasionate belief, it was a
fact of life, like being born or getting maried or dieing.  they were surrounded
by priests and the sound of church bells.  There days, weeks, and years were
devided by the church, theyre began and ended in the church.  By and large they
had no very good idea of what it all meant, they just did it.  It was there.
it was, well, mundane.  i'd like to see more of it.

I find myself intrigued by Wm. de Corbie's outlook on religion (as he
has so far expressed it in these ethereal domains) and thus am tempted to
digress some small distance into philosophical realms.

I realize that this won't be to everyone's taste so please feel free to
skip this if you don't think that you'll be interested.

William states flatly that nobody believes in Thor these days, then
backs up a bit (as well he might!) and says that he means that the
actual period Scandanavian religion has no living branch in these
modern times.  (At least, I think that's what he meant, since as far as
I can tell those who are Christian in this day and age do not in fact
belong to the medieval Church either.)  (Which is certainly just as
well since nearly all the Christians I know don't toe any medieval
"party line" and might end up in big trouble. ;-)   William then goes
on to say that if a "blot" would offend people who might be around,
then we shouldn't have one.

Well, I agree with his point about not offending people.

I am wondering what William thinks about:  what makes a deity real?
what makes a religion legitimate?  is he using "cult" in the
(Frenchified) sense of "religion" or in the Americanized sense of "a
religious group which exploits its members and enforces rigid ideas"
(roughly), or in some other sense?  I am fairly sure that my asking
these things will be enough to make him want to answer at some length,
but I am asking him to do some serious thinking first.  (Specifically,
to identify his underlying assumptions, and then to question them
privately, and then to think about the possible alternatives, and then
to choose as he sees fit whether or not to modify any of them.)

If we can pull some of these assumptions out into the open, and also
agree on some definitions of terms, I think we will find that ideas
are getting across more effectively.  

In terms of the SCA, I would rather see us mostly ignore religion in our
*official* doings (as is by and large the case), than tear ourselves up
over it, as so many mundane political entities around the world seem prone 
to doing.  This means we need to tolerate a fairly wide range of
private (and probably low-key) religious activities at events, etc.
It seems to me that we can treat medieval religious art, music, etc. as
first and foremost art in its public aspect, and thus leave intact its
religious impact as a private aspect.  (Liturgy as art is of course
problematic from this approach, for which I have no easy answer.)  

>From the above one may gather that I feel religion to be a private
matter.  I do.  That is one of my assumptions.  Another of my
assumptions is that most Scadians are pretty tolerant people.  (I think
it has something to do with running around in funny clothes and
spending one's free time hitting people with sticks and cooking odd
dishes for 150 close friends. ;-)  Put these two assumptions together
and you will probably see why I think we can work out whatever
religious conflicts might arise in the SCA context.

P. S.  I will bet that William has to pay a lot more for xeroxing than
most of us do.  It's just plain very cheap in the States, or on U.S.
military bases; most people won't realize that till they have to copy a

Message-Id: <4393@pt.cs.cmu.edu>

This is a direct copy of a handout I got at the Caidan herald's meeting, 
written by the autocrat.  Typos are probably mine. - Elsbeth

   Unto all heralds and scribes of the Known World doth Eowyn Amberdrake
   send Greetings!

   You are invited to attend the Caidan Heraldic Symposium and Scribe's
Conclave on July 8 and 9, 1989.  It will be held at Loyola Marymount
College in Westchester, about 15 minutes from the Los Angeles airport, in
southern California.  This is a weekend after the 4th of July holiday, and
science fiction fans may wish to spend that weekend in the area:  Westercon
is at the Disneyland hotel, about an hour away.  Cost of the Symposium will
be $20 for the weekend, which includes participation in classes, College of
Arms discussions, a scroll exhibit, a wine and cheese party Friday night, a
continental breakfast Saturday and Sunday, and a revel Saturday night with
dancing and live music.

   You are also invited to submit a paper or papers to the Symposium
Proceedings.  There will be two volumes, one for heralds and one for
scribes.  We plan to publish them before the Symposium, so that they will
be available on site.  Please feel free to submit a paper, even if you are
not planning on attending the event.  We can accept your paper either
typed, on large or small diskette (either in Microsoft Word format for the
IBM or in either Microsoft Word or MacWrite format for the Macintosh), or
downloaded over your modem to our local SCA BBS.  Deadline for papers is
May 27, 1989.

   Heralds are invited to bring their herald's tabards, particularly those
with the arms of their group, for a group photograph of the gathered
College of Arms.  Copies will be available for sale.

   For those who arrive early, there will be an expedition to the J. Paul
Getty museum on Friday, to view the manuscripts, Greek and Roman
antiquities, and medieval art.  Other sightseeing trips to major area
museums, bookstores, or the garment district may be planned if there is
enough interest.

   The Symposium itself will start with a wine and cheese party Friday night.
Saturday there will be discussion groups for various heraldic special
interest groups (e.g. precedence heralds), scribal special interest groups
(e.g. how a scriptorium works), classes for both beginning and advanced
heralds and scribes, a scroll show, Rules for Submissions discussions, and
so on.  We will arrange to have lunch available on campus, so the
discussions started in the morning can easily spill over lunch time.  That
evening there will be a banquet and revel with both court and country
dancing to live music.  Sunday we hope to have a Laurel meeting to consider
at least on Kingdom's submissions.  All heralds who have never been to a
Laurel meeting will find this explains the process of device registration
much better than any description.  If there is no Laurel meeting, there
will be further classes and discussion groups.  Meanwhile, the scribes will
have an opportunity to take classes from other scribes of the known world
on various tools and techniques, such as quill cutting.  The scrolls will
still be on display as well.  Sunday night we'll wind down without any
planned activities.  There will also be a merchant's area both days for
items of heraldic or scribal interest.  If you have things to sell, please
bring them.

   On-campus housing will be available from the end of Westercon through the
Symposium at $15 per night, double-occupancy.  If you provide us with
notice, we will be able to pick you up at the airport (or other port of
entry) and take you to the site, and back to catch your flight (or train or
boat or blimp...).  Our travel agent would be happy to help you make
arrangements to get to LA.

   If you have any questions, would like to register, submit a paper, or
volunteer to teach a class, please communicate with the appropriate person
listed below.  Feel free to distribute this invitation to any you think
would be interested.  Please come and help make this a fun, fascinating
symposium.  I hope to see you in July!

Subject: Svartsoppa recipe
Message-ID: <890302155949.31.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

"Svartsoppa" means "black soup" and was eaten by Vikings. I have a modern
recipe which pobably tastes better than what the Vikings had but if you
remove the brandy and the wine, it should be about the same thing.

The traditional way to eat this soup is with slices of apple, goose liver
sausage and dried prunes.

Ingredients:

4 liters boillon (of beef)
8 deciliters blood
1.5 deciliters wheat flour
2.5-3 deciliters red wine
2 deciliters madeira wine
6 spoons brandy
some apple and prune juice
6 spoons vinegar
6.5 spoons molasses
0.5 teaspoon white pepper
1.5 teaspoon Jamaica pepper
2.5 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon ginger
0.5 teaspoon cloves
5 teaspoons salt

Bring the bouillon to boil and thicken it with some of the flour stirred
in a little cold water. Let it boil for 20 minutes.
Boil apple slices and prunes in a light sugar solution.
Strain the bouillon and pour it back in the pot. Strain the blood and
slowly pour it into the bouillon while whipping the bouillon strongly.
Bring the mixture to boil while whipping it, then remove from the stove
immediately.
Add spices, wine and fruit juices. Be careful with the spices so the
soup doesn't get too hot, too sweet or too sour. 
Let the soup rest over night. Whip strongly when you heat it.

As I said, this recipe is *not* period, but the soup you get should at
least be faintly like the Viking variety.

Sorry for the language of the description. Cooking terminlogy isn't
included in Swedish High School English.

Subject: Question: minors at Pennsic?

Greetings, good fisherfolk.  Can anyone help clarify some information for me?
(No rumours, please.  I have to repeat this to someone's parents.)  Anyway,
what is the current policy about having minors at Pennsic who are not escorted
by their parents?  Here's my problem:

One of our new members is 16 years old.  He doesn't fight, fence, or shoot
archery (though he does fence mundanely and is looking forward to joining our
fencers when he gets old enough).  He's perfectly civilized and isn't the type
to run wild in the streets... all in all, he's pretty nice to have around.
He would like to go to Pennsic, but his parents aren't interested in going with
him (they're not in the SCA).

Once upon a time he would have been able to get a notarized letter of permission
from his parents, designating someone (probably myself) as his legal guardian
for the week, and he would be able to attend that way.  Is this still true?
Is there any way I can get this guy to Pennsic, even if I have to be "mother
for a week"?

I'd appreciate any information you gentles may have.  Many thanks.

Good gentles...

As seneschal of a new group in the Nortern Reach of the Kingdom of
the Middle, I am faced with a dilemma.  The average annual snowfall
in our area is well over 200 inches.  During that time it is very
difficult to fight, both outside (for obvious reasons) and inside
(due to the lack of available space).  We have been trying to come
up with new ideas for indoor activities (such as armour making,
costuming, and brewing) but we are quickly becoming bogged down
by the same old things.

I would appreciate ANY and ALL suggestions from groups that have
been in the same or similar situation.  How about game suggestions?
Or cooking suggestions?

As always, I shall remain,

Greetings, my lady Ariel.

I cannot speak with authority about policies this year, as they have
not yet been annouced.  The person to contact for the absolute
up-to-date information would be the autocrat, whose has been announced
in the Pale.  If you need the name & address, let me know.

I can tell you what the policy has been for the past two years, as set
by the Coopers: There will be no minors on site at Pennsic unless
escorted by their parents.  Letters of permission or temporary
guardianship papers are not recognized by the State Courts of
Pennsylvania, so such documents are of no help.  This policy is a
result of requirements on the Coopers dictated by their insurance.  It
has been absolutely enforced.

Subject: religion & politiks

help help help, i am more confused than ever

please do not hide your arguments in private e-mail (unless of course you 
would be embarassed by personal relevations or feel an uncontrollable desire 
to make ad hominem remarks)

can we have a mass in the main hall if it's not 12th night?
	the mass is sacred artform as the villanelle and the ballo are secular 
ones.  noone ever objects if a medieval mass is sung as part of a consert (do 
they?).  my problem is that a consert of sacred music is a hopelessly mundane 
concept (all sences of the word).  on the other hand to perform the mass with 
a fake priest and fake wafers is obviously wrong.  is what we need to do pick 
a local event and a hall off the main hall and round up a willing priest 
(would there be such a thing?) or is it possible to do without priest and 
sacrement while still not degenerating into a concert performance?

where does religious persona stop and religious ritual begin?
	can a head of houshold say grace for his table at an event?
	can a king have a chappel royal that sings for him at events?
	can he have monk personas follow him arround reading/chanting/praying
		like Richard III does in the movie?
	One person in a monks robe saying 'pox vobiskum' doesnt seem to bother 
anyone, what about 12 people in monks or pilgrims garb doing gregorian chant?
	can a moslem persona read outof the queran?
	can a christina persona tell stories out of the bible? the appocrifa?  
the lives of saints??
	Is an illustrated book of psalms an appropriate prize for a tourney or 
competition?  What about an illustrated gospels (the illustrations are 
*nice*)?

What about mirical plays?  Some were done in the church, some of them were 
secular, but still about religious subjects.  Many of them treat thier 
religious subjecs with, um, levity, to say the least, and most insert a good 
bit of horseplay.  Do these become more acceptable when the actors are 
christians?

Brighid Carthaigh  writes of prayers and the call to prayer:

	"...But to have one religion effect everyone if even for the space of 
time it takes to hear a blessing would infringe on freedoms.  Even though the 
particular instance might not bother me personally, I would be unhappy because 
of its implications."

What freedoms?  What implications?  How does hearing a call to prayer in the 
sca differ from the seeing a Mosque in ordinary life, or the sight of 
religious hoo-ha which almost invariably addorns the interiors of event sites?
Would anyone mind if they heard bells ringing the cannonical hours? Would they 
mind less if they wern't the cannonical hours, but meerly a way of deviding up 
time at the event?

BTW, what does the call to prayr consist of?  Mustapha??

("]ke Eldberg") writes:
>Those present-day people who claim to believe in Thos do not in fact belong
>to the ancient Scandinavian religion. 

well, gosh, Those present-day people who claim to believe in Christ don't 
belong to Medieval Christianity either.  Medieval christianity was inextrably 
bound with medieval life (and vice versa).  The UCC bares rather less 
resemblance to the church of 1300 than I do to my grandmother, and modern 
catholisism isnt all that much closer.  Since someone is going to be 
offended no matter what we do, perhaps the criterion we should use is respect 
for the god involved rather than in some modern person's sensibilities?

BTW what's a blot?

AS long as wer're offending people, what do we do about all the medival 
litterature that plays on corruption in the church, letcherous or gluttonous 
friers,  foolish or avaricious popes?   What about the way med. lit. treats 
jews?  Can I vilify the saracen ( a fierce, cruel people, trecherous and 
unchristian) without having the Ayatolah Khomeni call for my public beheading?

Subject: Sacrilege
Message-ID: <890302235004.19.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

Oh, dear. I seem to be having some difficulties making myself clear on
religious ceremonies. Okay, here is another attempt:

First of all, I would not dream of giving my own religion special treatment.
Regardless of which religion somebody believes in, he is entitled to have
his faith respected by others.

If my wife was an actress and she was doing a play which involved a sex scene,
I would want them to fake it. I would not want her to have *real* sex with
some actor colleague of hers. Somebody might say "it's not for real, because
it's only a play". But if they had real sex, it would still be another man
having sex with my wife - which I would dislike! The fact that it was done as
part of a play would not make it less real. If you perform a mass and you say
"it's not for real, it's only a re-enactment", this wouldn't work either.
Some things are too sacred to be done theatrically. You can't do them without
touching their holiness and the reality behind them. This is why a theatrical
mass would not work.

Performing a mass in Latin and/or according to a medieval ritual, is perfectly
OK. I would love to do this myself. What matters is the reason for the ceremony
Are we saying that we want to have communion with God, and because we love the
Middle Ages we choose a medieval ritual? This would be OK. But if we say that
we want to do a medieval ceremony but we really don't care about God, then
it would be sacrilege.

Sacrilege is in the eye of the beholder. It is only possible if there are people
who believe in the religion against which the sacrilege is committed. I am
offended if someone mocks Jesus Christ. But I am not offended if someone mocks
Richard Nixon, because I do not regard him as a deity or a holy person.

I am offended if someone celebrates a mass while denying the Christian faith.
But I am not offended if someone performs an SCA coronation while being a
republican. Most SCA things can be done as part of the game we play. Kings in
the SCA don't think of themselves as kings in their mundane life. They don't
expect people to bow to them in the street. Our SCA personas are separate
from our mundane identities. But such a separation isn't possible with living
religions, because the mundane religion is the same religion even if its 
rituals are performed in the SCA. It is impossible to perform them in the SCA
without a connection to the Real Thing in present-day reality.

It's true as milord Randell Jesup says, that almost anything we do is bound to
offend somebody. Offense cannot be avoided. There are probably people who are
offended by us weird medievalists wearing costume. But we still do it. This
is because there are some types of offense that we ignore, because we think
they are unwarranted or stupid, and other types that we avoid giving, because
we understand the reasons for them..

When I said that performing a Viking "blot" as a re-enactment should not
offend anyone, I meant that I could not see any *reason* for offense there,
just as I can't see any good reason for offense in SCA costume. Is there
anyone on the net who would be offended by a Viking "blot" re-enactment?
I would be interested in learning why.

I do not doubt that even a short announcement during court or other
public/central event could be done in such a manner as to offend many
people.

What I might find offensive would be a presumption on the part of the
announcer that all right-thinking people will want to attend the
religious event 'to be held later and somewhere else so as not to offend
the sensitive'.

Fortunately, I have never run into this sort of this at Society events.
Would that more of the world was this thoughtful.  I am sure I am not
the only non-Christian who gets tired of sincere-sounding mundane-world
politicians and public figures explaining that since 'America is a
Christian Nation' we all ought to believe X, do Y, and forbid Z.  (You
know how hard it is to buy beer on Sunday morning in Boston? :-)

We have been skillful and lucky so far in protecting our small realm
from the divisive conflicts that tore the world apart during the
historical period we re-create.  Our extra caution is merited here.

On the other hand, there are probably many things that could be done
without offending.  Some of the examples presented in earlier letters --
singing sacred songs or prayers during the coronation scene of a play,
for instance -- might present no problem.  Here, the audience is not
being asked to worship.

I would, also, not be offended, for instance, if, while crossing a field
at the War, I heard, off in the distance, the Islamic call to prayer.
(I'd be more offended by the number of clauses and commas in that
previous sentence.)  It would be another detail that would make the War
a real place in another time.

Admittedly, if my tent turned out to be next to a 'mosque' and I was
woken up too darn early the morning, I'd have a different opinion.  But
this is simply common courtesy.  I wouldn't want to wake up next to a
smithy, either.

I hope this sheds little or no heat, and some small light.

I can think of one "power" that a clique could have.  They could co-ordinate
their letters of recommendation to the king.  Everybody in the clique 
recommends that clique member Lord A should get the kingdom service award,
and Lady B should get the kingdom arts award, and Lord C etc.  In a large
kingdom, the king can't possibly know all the citizens and realize that these
are fraudulent recommendations.  Once the clique members are in various orders,
it increases their capacity to cause trouble.

I checked East Kingdom Law.  The Earl Marshall has no authority in the matter.
His authority is limited to what goes on in the rattan lists only.  He can't
even say anything about fencing lists unless he does it through the Fencing
Marshall who works under him.  The laws mention live steel only briefly, and
make it the sole province of the king.  After a first offence, the guilty
party should receive a private warning, after the second, a public reprimand,

	"After the third offense, the Sovereign and Consort may
	 have the offender banned from Kingdom honor if they so
	 choose."

Whatever that means.  Banished?  Stripped of awards?  It says nothing about
who has the authority to stop the king from baring steel.

I'd like to point out that this is a different, albeit similiar, problem.
It's entirely possible that the child witnessed a safe use of bare steel,
(e.g. the king knighting a fighter, a juggler working with knives, an actor 
dressed as St. George "killing" an actor/ess costumed as a dragon, etc.)

As a matter of fact, I find it sufficiently different that I'd like to open
it up to the net as a separate discussion topic.  Obviously, the parent has
the responsibility to see that the child knows s/he should not play with
live steel.  But what is the responsibility of the performer involved?  What
are they to do when the audience is partly composed of small children?
Leave the matter entirely to the parent?  Give a verbal disclaimer? Or a brief
statement about all the rehearsal time spent with sheathed steel?  Skip that
part of the performance?

I intend to continue this as a discussion topic in the next issue of my
performing arts newsletter, The Jongleur.  I would like to print any responses
I receive on the net, unless people state they would prefer not to be printed.

SCA is a non religious organization, which is as it should be.  SCA cannot
sponsor any religious activities, but individuals can, for the edification of
the curious, hold classes, discussions, or demonstrations.  In other words,
they can conduct religious services as long as it is done in such a way that a
person who does not want to participate does not have to, even accidentally.
And a person who wants to watch cannot be denied.  However, practioners of a
religion cannot be compelled to violate their religion either.  As an example,
I who am not a Christian, once attended a Catholic mass with my friend, who
attended seminary.  When I joined the line for communion, he objected
strenuously.  "You can't take communion unless you believe it's the body and
blood of Jesus Chrsit!"  Well, I believed it, so I took it, which left him
rather baffled.

 In my particular case, I believe all religions, I just don't  happen to
 agree with most of them. If there are things that nonbelievers are not
 supposed to do, then it ought to be explained beforehand so that
nonbeleivers can avoid it.  On the other hand, it would be better that any  
activity requiring one to believe it to participate in ought to be private.
So it is all right for pagans to have their circles of dance in honor of
the God/dess, but if they're going to call down the moon, that is not
appropriate to the SCA-unless of course they're willing to let nonbeleivers
participate in that ritual. On the other hand such an activity could be
 conceivably considered to be barred by the SCA rule that people not do
 anything that might possibly cause harm to somebody.  Rituals, if performed
 with power, are not matters to be done foolishly. 

The issue has also been raised as to whether performing religious rituals for
people who don't believe in them is sacriligous or not.  I have  a suggestion
for this: Demonstrations.  A demonstration is not an actual ritual, although
all the steps are gone through.  For example, if people hold a a wedding, and
announce that it is not a *real* wedding, then it is not.  That is why wedding
rehearsals do not cause two people to be married, even if the minister does say
the words pronouncing them man and wife.  So, if somebody wanted to a demo of a
Catholic mass, or  a Viking blot, that should be okay, because it isn't a real
religious ceremony, and it is certainly well within the definitions of the
purposes of the society.  Of course, some people aren't going to like it
anyhow, so to be diplomatic, religious demos ought to be held off to the side
so that people who don't want to see them  don't have to.

And as for real, honest to god/dess rituals, if they're conducted by an
ordained minister who tells everybody up front that it is a real ritual, such
things can be allowed so long as they are private and voluntary.  Every year at
Pennsic a pagan priestess leads a circle.  Anyone is welcome to participate.
It's actaully rather dull, most religious rituals are.  The ceremony is
dedicated to some benign purpose (the one I attended had us ask the goddess Hebe
to spare us any serious injuries during the War).  The same priestess has
conducted very private, no-you're-not-supposed-to-know-about-it rituals in a
private place, for members of her coven only, with guards set so that no one
could accidentally stumble into the middle of where they weren't wanted.

A Catholic priest used to hold period masses (in Latin) at the War too.  He
used a  public building for his mass which was wrong, because it housed toilets
and showers.  This meant somebody wanting to use the facilities ended up
listening to Christian ritual whether he wanted to or not.  Lately it hasn't
been done.  I hope that means it's been moved to a more private place rather
than that it's been discontinued.

And a note to William de Corbie:  The people I know who claim to be Odinists,
etc, really are sincere in their belief, to the point of founding legally
recognized churches and ordaining ministers.  At least two groups have built
halls and conducted legal marriages and other ceremonies.  They are
neo-pagans, true, people who have rediscovered and converted to the Old 
Religion as best as they can reconstruct it.  But even if you don't consider
them *real* Odinists, I know some people who are.  They are descendents of
Vikings that settled in Brittany and never converted to Christianity.  They
brought their Old Religion with them when they immigrated to the United States.
I haven't had much contact with them, they're very secretive.  Some of them
have attended SCA events, but I don't know if they've actually joined.  I doubt
it.   After all, to them it is not a fun hobby, it is something very real and
personal.

And a note to everybody: I  know several people who used to be in the SCA and
quit because of the problem of religion.  One fellow followed an esoteric
Oriental philosophy which he had studied at length in Japan and was recognized
for a  very high level o f achievement by his school.  This philosophy
happens to popular among various people who don't know beans about it, and who
kept telling him he was wrong whenever they discussed it with him.  He got
 disgusted and quit.  This is a rather extreme case, but other people I
 know gave SCA a try, bumped into the religion issue, and decided they didn't
 want the hassle.

What it all boils down to is that studying medieval religions ought to be part
of the SCA, but practicing medieval religions, sincerely or as demonstrations,
ought to be conducted with great care taken  to avoid giving offense. I
personally have stopped wearing insignia of my religion at events because
people were avoiding me because they didn't agree with my religion.  Now I
don't even talk about religion with people until I've had enough contact with
them to know they're going to accept that fact that I follow a very esoteric,
uncommon religion.  And in the mundane world I also find it necessary  to
remind people that Christianity may be the majority religion, but it is not
the only one.

Subject: Chivalry in combat
Message-ID:  <8903022318.aa13127@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

n the discussions about whether a person ought to give up a limb if his
opponent loses a limb, several good points ahve been raised.  First, that it is
chivalrous to give up an *advantage*.  If you're an unbelted fighter, and you
take Duke Sir Superduke's leg, you are not giving up an advantage by if you
refuse to give up a leg.  At best, you have bought yourself a little time
longer before you die.  At worst, you've hastened your death.  I have heard the
remark "He took Aldric's leg.  He's doomed now."  

A second point, is that an accident, such as slipping on the grass
is the result of chance, not skill, so you ought not take advantage of it.  It
could also be dangerous.  Taking a leg is due to your own skill at arms,
 and as such, you ought to exploit it because it is your prowess that earned
 that advantage.  

A third point is cultural.  From time to time and place to place, conventions
varied.  The Japanese considered anything that happened in battle, accidental
or deliberate, to be all part of the battle and deserving of exploitation.  In
England, they developed elaborate handicapping rules for combat by trial to
assure that both sides were exactly even.  Only if both sides were perfectly
balanced could the outcome be construed as the will of God.

And another point, when it is announced that there is a contest for most
chivalrous fighter, points of honor become more frequent.  Obviously, people
are modifying their behavior in hopes of winning.  (They're going for the
dangly, not the personal satisfaction.)  I agree that such contests ought not
to be announced.  They also ought to be more common.  The queen, or other
aristocrat ought to keep her eyes peeled and give the appropriate award to the
people who deserve it.   And that award is one that it ought to be possible to
earn more than once. 

What it all boils down to is individual style and honor.  There were the same
disputes in the Middle Ages as we are having now. And of course, there were
real villains back then who did some pretty nasty things that nobody in the 
SCA has ever tried.(Hmm, new tourney idea :  Villians Tourney:-)  Which brings
up the question, why shouldn't a person have a villainous persona if he wanted?
Provided he got his victims permission beforehand, of course.)

Yours in service.

Greeting from Hal Ravn:

Certainly--see below for my caveat on this.

You are making the assumption that those present know it is to be a
staged--and one hopes, well rehearsed--presentation.  This rather
requires that up fornt notice be given that such is planned.  (I can
just see it in my Kingdom Newsletter now:  "At Beltane Coronation Festival,
the King is to be overthrown by coup de main, at Court.  The 
insurrectionists will be armed with live steel.  All spectators are
respectfully asked to stand clear, and all loyal Knights and Masters at
Arms are requested to remain seated and not defend their Liege.)

Certainly, members of the SCA are safer around live steel.  Mostly because
we recognize that the sword (or knife or mace or . . .) is *still* just
as lethal as it was a thousand years ago--and we handle such implements
with the care that knowledge implies.

>I AM concerned about the case where "people were bouncing through the

If the events happened as described--they are indefensible.  One would
hope that they are also unrepeatable.

If one does not know how well the event is rehearsed.  If one sees
eveident danger.  If one sees imminenet risk to life and limb, then
the cry of "HOLD!" is entirely appropriate.  Without the knowledge
that the event is well planned and that the players know their marks
and can adhere to them--one should err of the side of safety.  If the
events took place as described--then the cry should have been given.

>If you feel that violence at a coronation, or that a staged live steel

On the contrary.  If the is risk, and it does not appear to be well
controlled, then one should NOT let it pass.  Personally--I feel that
*violence* at coronation is uncalled for.  This does not necessarily
preclude a staged *threat* of violence.  For the safety of all involved,
I am forced to act on the available data.  That data includes knowing
how to take any *apparent* threat.  If I know the people involved--I
will take what I know of them into account.  If not--I will search for
clues as to the real intent.  As soon as there appears to be a real
risk of injury--or death--then I *must* act.

>One last thing - new regulations should not be invented to cover this

Agreed--we have enough internal rules to cover this.  The basic one is
the implied rule to act reasonably.  As for the specifics under discussion,
the East Kingdom already has laws that can cover this.  Under the Rights
of Citizens, there is a clause covering the unsafe use of live steel.

Greetings to all from Aell Aethelwita, called Ellethel:

It is my understanding that by inter-kingdom agreement (as well as mundane
agreement with the owners of the property) that Pennsic falls on the third
Saturday of August, every year, with official opening ceremonies the day
before (Friday) about noon and official closing on Sunday afternoon. Of
course many gentles arrive sooner and/or stay later. If I am in error,
perhaps some other gentle would correct me ....

Subject: Various


The Canton of the Towers is a subgroup of the Barony of Carolingia
which extends north of the city of Boston until it hits the New
Hampshire (Stonemarche) border, and runs west until roughly Natick.
Towers is part of the Barony, but is additionally incorporated in the
SCA so it can sponser its own events, &c. It is also the oldest canton
in the Twelve Laurel Kingdoms.  It has just recently gotten a new
seneshal (Merriadoc sometimes called the Unwise), and is rapidly
becoming more active.  I don't know where Plum Island is, but if you
are West of Boston, you may be part of the Shire of Quintavia instead.

As a rule Carolingia does not camp as a group at the war, but as
several groups.  [As a matter of fact, Baron Patri does not plan to go
this year so one might say that Carolingia is not going to the war,
but that would be only techincally correct].  There will probably be
large encampments associated with the Weresheep, and Earl Sir
Sebastian Nightwind's household, but that is only supposition.  There
will also be numerous smaller groups forming.  Maybe Towers would be
one of them.  In general it is completely impractical to camp all of
the 40-50 Carolingians at the war into one site, groups of 8-12 are
best for sharing cooking and campside duties.

In any case, welcome back.

 I'm trying *really* hard not to flame.)

Why can't a Christian ceremony could not be held in the way it was during
the Middle Ages?  (ie, in Latin and with all of the trappings of High Mass?)
I don't understand why *not* performing the services in the vernacular would
be sacrilege.  Can't the services be "legitimate," (ie, with [most of] the
participants actually using the time to worship) but also a re-creation of
Christian ceremonies in the Middle Ages?

I don't understand: this paragraph seems to be saying exactly the opposite
of what you said in the first line that I quoted.  How many modern-day
Christians go to church every Sunday merely out of obligation, not because
they desire to go?  (I remember being dragged to church upon pain of death,
and I'm probably not the only one.)

It sounds to me like you're saying that unembellished Christian ceremonies,
in the forms that they are practiced in today, would be perfectly all right;
but that ceremonies which attempted to re-create the older forms would not,
because they would attract people who do not believe in the Christian God.
Am I misinterpreting you?  If so, then I apologise.  If not, please explain
why it's so terrible.  (Perhaps via direct E-mail, in deference to those
gentles on the net who are not interested in theological discussions.
We're actually talking more about modern theology and values than we are
about Mediaeval theology and values.)

(Flashback) makes a touching plea for new people 

justin@inmet (Mark Waks) strenthens this plea by pointing out that "It is 
*everyone's* responsibility to help new people"

As long as we're handing out responsibility...
	it is the newpersons responsibility to identify him/her self as new.  
True, no one should act discourtiously, insultingly, or condecendingly to 
anyone he (she) doesn't know, HOWEVER, the atmosphere in the sca tends to be 
familiar, informal, and boisterous--"i'm new" is the magic phrase that will 
avert coments about the new persons mode of address, pollyester liesure 
pourpoint, and vulcan ears.  I'm sorry to say that my reaction to 
(Flashback's) hero's woes was neither "gosh, poor guy" nor "what insensitive 
jerks" but "where on earth are his parents and why aren't they watching him?"

	How did this poor person find his way to an event anyway?  Events are 
*terrible* first introductions to the SCA (by and large, there are exceptions) 
and even worse for a person alone.  Everyone is very busy,  and the only 
usefull thing a new person can do is scullery.  And courts are not only boring 
and interminable, they're meaningless as well and the poor tyro doesn't know 
yet how to escape into the kitchen.  There are between 40 and 400 people there 
whose names he will never remember.  Guild meetings, garb workshops, dancing/ 
fighting/singing practices, sewing circles...Thats the place for a newcomer.

A tyro at his first event should ideally have a patron: one to make sure he 
has garb and feast gear, one who is willing to spend the entire event with his 
protegee, explaining, intruducing, making sure he is never cast adrift, and 
averting such social solecisms as wearing a white belt or being careless with 
knives.  This is not a job one places permenantly on an officer,  nor is it a 
job for someone who is himself socially insecure (true of *many* sca people 
even of several years standing).  This is where households are *really* usefull!
Twice to many times the resourses of a single person or couple!  twice the 
contatcts!  Twice the favors to cash!  twice the interests, twice the 
knowledge, twice the warm bodies!!!

	all right, suppose noone has taken the poor chik under his/her wing, 
what then?  Does a new person have to stand forlornly at the edges of the 
list, or is there something he can do?

	 Well, a group doing informal sight reading generally attracts the 
interest of the musically inclined.  Many people are familiar with the 
"accapella singer" and there are books of rounds that are easy and period 
which ditto.  If i bring any recorders at all, i usually bring a few spare, 
and someone always has extra music.  The carolingian needle worker's guild is 
working on a tapestry which they bring to events and anyone who wishes can

Good gentles,

  The BoD's policy on religion boils down to a simple rule: No
religious activity may take place as a central activity of an SCA
event.  This means, for example, that you should not schedule Mass in
the Main Hall at Twelfth Night, Royal Court should not open with a
prayer, and the presiding noble should not say Grace publically before
the feast.  On the other hand, it does not mean that you can't hold
religious services at an event: Only that you must set it up so that
no one feels obliged to attend, or feels left out if he does not.  It
does not mean that an individual is in any way prohibited from
appearing at an event in ecclesiastical garb and persona.  

Personally, I find any attempt to recreate the Middle Ages without
religion foolish.  My feeling is that a little religious display adds
to the ambience.  As long as it is undertaken with good taste and with
forethought to avoid offense, I see no problem.

Good cheer!

	Arval.

Good Gentles,

As the person who started the discussion, I would like to thank everyone
for their comments.  I would like to make the following points, responding
to your responses, then we can move on to other discussions.

Yes, the instances of bare steel in Court are "staged" presentations, since
most Coronation ceremonies are staged.  I doubt that they are rehearsed,
however.  Also, I do want to make the point that, up until now at least,
there has never been an actual sword fight using bare steel during the
ceremony.  Mostly, the occurrances have consisted of armed retainers
rushing the stage and resulting in face-to-face stand-offs with armed
retainers on stage.  The standoff is then broken by verbal exchanges
between the King and Prince.

As to the retainers bouncing through the audience, yes, it did happen.  The
hall was set up such that there were two groups of chairs with a central
aisle.  When some of the Prince's retainers entered the hall, they used a
door that  was in one corner at the back of the hall with chairs lined up
in front of it.  This required the retainers to climb over the chairs and
around people sitting in chairs to get to the central aisle.

I would like to especially thank Sir Michael for his comments.  You made
some very good points, my Lord, and I thank you for them.  This was an
issue that had been on my mind and I was interested to see if anyone else
had had the same reactions I had to it.  What I did find interesting is I
have not seen any comments from other gentles who attended the same events
and may have seen the instances differently, or from retainers themselves.

Again, thank you all for your notes.  Now, on to bigger and brighter
things!

The Lady Malice in Digest 260 asked if some types of period activities
having religious conotations would offend anyone.  She gave some examples
of religious music or calls to prayers.

In answer to your question milady:  I would be disturbed by it.  I am
comfortable with someone depicting/living their persona with religious
aspects - people with crosses on their devices, making certain that
garb follows the dictates of a religion's clothing laws etc.  But to
have one religion effect everyone if even for the space of time it takes
to hear a blessing would infringe on freedoms.  Even though the particular
instance might not bother me personally, I would be unhappy because of
its implications.

I don't know how it is in Northern countries but "point of honor", pundonor in
Spanish, was a pretty personal thing.

In Spain, a person had pundonor, if at certain point or circumstances he had to
correct the matter even if it meant risking everything.  For instance if you
insult a spaniard too much he must defend his pundonor by doing something about
it.  Or if you save his life some spaniards would give up their family and life
to follow you if you were on some perilous mission.

	There will be people who are offended by almost anything, especially
involving religion.  There are people who are offended by men with long hair,
by women with uncovered hair, by other people even believing in certain
things (many people are intolerant of pagans/neo-pagans), by other people
NOT believing in certain things, etc, etc.  Anything you do or don't do,
especially with religion, will offend someone.

	Speaking to the particular point, would a scene in a play involving
a christian ceremony be "sacreligous"?  Even if the actors didn't believe in
it?  What about in an open-air festival?  What about a movie?  What if only
a few people at this ceremony believed in (some particular) God?  What if the
people putting it on didn't feel it was sacreligous, even though they do
believe?  In every case, I'm certain _someone_ will be offended.

	I'm sorry if I seem to be flaming, but when I hear people start saying
something is sacreligous and therefor shouldn't be allowed, it ticks me off.
Witness the whole thing over "The Satanic Verses".  How many of these people
howling for Rushdie's blood have ever read the book?  Maybe .0001%?  How many
people have been killed in the last thousand years for being sacreligous, or
believing in old religions (aka witches), or in "Holy Wars", etc, etc? 
Religion is fine, it's the imposition of one's religous values on others that
gets to me.

Subject: Newbies / Apology

(Actually, the first part of my posting concerns newbies & naked blades...)

At Pennsic last year, I was camped with a newbie.  One day, we went to look
at some of the merchants' wares.  Igor, the newbie, bought a sword.

The sword did not come with a scabbard, so we went immediately back to camp
with it.  He carried it in both hands so it would not swing free and injure
someone.

He was immediately accosted by a *knight* who berated him for carrying naked
steel so openly.  This ashamed Igor so much that he didn't even try to explain
*why* he was carrying an unsheathed blade, and the knight went on for about
five minutes, actually *yelling* at him about safety, and how could he be
so stupid, &c.  Igor decided that he really didn't want to be in the SCA
if everybody was going to be like that.

As to the second part of my posting:  I apologize if the tone of my letters
concerning religion and arguments-over-the-net has been strong or
inappropriate.  In the future I shall try not to flame, but wait 24 hours
before sending responses, to try and cool down.  It's just that I feel rather
strongly about both topics.  Again, my deepest and most humble apologies.

I'm sure that is what the original poster meant. What I suspect the poster
that you were replying to meant was that there was an inconsistency in the
attitude of the original poster. The OP claimed that it was sacrilege for
a non-Christian to perform the medieval Christian mass but that it was
perfectly OK for one who did not believe in any certain pagan religion to
perform the rites of that religion. Personally, being non-religious, I see
Christianity to be no different from Thor-worship or Druidism. Therefore it
seems to me that it would be equally offensive (or benign, depending on your
attitude) for someone who did not believe in any single religion to perform
the rituals of that religion.

The fact that Christianity is a "live" religion whereas Thor is a supposedly
"dead" god is irrelevant. The OP, as a Christian, felt personally offended by
the notion that a non-Christian would mock the rituals of his/her heartfelt
superstition. They took no such offense from the idea that someone might mock
the rituals of someone else's heartfelt superstition. So what if those who
once held this religion to their breast and used it to sustain themselves in
this world are now dead? What they felt is still worthy of respect just as much
as our dear OP's beloved Christianity.

Sorry for rambling, but I get a little hot under the collar when someone wraps
themselves up in their personal superstitions and biases and claims that theirs
is the "right" way to believe. My apologies if I have offended anyone.

I thought "Timeline" was a well-crafted program, as Justin noted.  I
rate the program as 2.5 stars out of 4, because of a problem with
suspension of disbelief.

I'm quite willing to buy the basic foundation of the show, that TV was
invented well before 1100 CE.  I like the anachronistic blend, because
it is very well done: TV and the use of modern English are the only
anachronisms.  The TV-related things are done in a modern TV style,
while the medieval parts (costuming, armoring, attitudes) are
generally good.

There were two problems: one was that the "interviews" don't look like
interviews, and the other is that the "news footage" doesn't look like
news footage.

The actors playing the "interviewees" seemed just that: *actors*.
They delivered well-structured, coherent speeches with dramatic flair
-- in other words, nothing at all like real people speak in
interviews, especially spur-of-the-moment live interviews.

The "news footage" photography (cinematography?) is far too smooth,
with rock-steady cameras and sophisticated zooms and pans.  When did
you ever see such smooth footage from a riot in Belfast, say?  There
has to be a subtle amount of crudity (not too much) for it to look
like real "news footage".

The total effect could be jarring.  I'd be lulled for a few minutes by
the anchorman and reporters in believing that this is a "Nightline" or
CNN in the 12th century, and then *wham* the illusion is shattered
(rock-steady pan across the sack of Jerusalem, or a landless knight
delivering a smooth speech).

I rate it as 2.5 out of 4, because of all the things it did right.
It's still very much worth watching, and I indend to do so.  But it
could have been better.

P.S.: one of the reporters was Siobhan (?) of Zimbabwe.  So
non-Europeans ARE in period -- if it's on PBS, it *must* be true! 8-)

While attending closing court at last Pennsic, I was sitting on an
aisle seat (actually a haybale).  A Tuchuk, dressed in skins and having
an unsheathed short sword tucked into a belt, got there late, and
decided to get a good seat by crouching in the aisle. When the royal
procession headed in, he had to make room, and did so by backing into
me. His sword point, which was behind him, wedged into my leg. I
remember how time slowed and I watched the skin start to indent under
the blade. Had I not immediately jumped back, he would no doubt have
impaled me.

Since, I am quite fierce about the handling of steel weapons. If I am
there, you will handle them right, or I will do what is necessary to
have you thrown out. There is no excuse for careless weapon handling,
just as there is no excuse for waving a loaded gun around in a room of
friends.

Thanks to Dani of the Seven Wells 
and Ellisif Flakkingskvinna, and others

for your concern about the problem with courtesy copies. I assumed that the
rules were the same everywhere in the SCA, but it is possible that the East
Kingdom is demanding more than other groups. Is the system different in other
parts of the Society?

In fact, some of the things you suggested are already being done. I send all
the copies which are for foreign people to the Principality Chronicler, and
she forwards them when a suitable quantity has arrived. This brings down my
postage costs for CC's considerably, and it relieves me of the trouble of
keeping record of all the addresses to Kingdom officers etcetera. But it 
does not help the production costs (xerox copies cost money).

I can cope with the costs. But I don't like the system because it's making
it difficult for small branches to have a newsletter at all. Instead of
hylping new groups to get a newsletter of their own, the system is punishing
them for trying.

If I received a personal letter from each one of these officers, asking for
copies, I would gladly send them at my own expense. Then they would truly be
*courtesy* copies. But I don't like being ordered to send them, with implicit
threats like "or you will be removed from office and it will reflect badly on
your group" etcetera. These aren't courtesy copies, they're extortion copies.

(A side point here is that all newsletters in Nordmark are in Swedish, so
very few of the CC recipients will be able to read the anyway.)

Thanks to Hal Ravn

for your concern about my modem problem. In fact, there is no problem now since
the 300 baud telephone lines were opened again. But I appreciate your kindness.

Milord Godfrey de Shipbrook,

I believe you have misunderstood me. I did not say that a Christian service
would be sacrilege if there were those present who did not believe. You
certainly don't have to be a professed Christian to attend services.

I said that we could not perform a Christian service theatrically. There are
many among us who believe in the Christian God, and who would be offended if we
made a play out of their most sacred ritual. What matters is the reason why
a service is performed. Is it done because (at least some of) those present
intend to pray and have communion with God, or is it done merely as a show,
with the intention of enjoying a fancy medieval ritual without caring for
the spiritual contents? The latter would be sacrilege. Going through the forms
of prayer while denying the existence of God would by a mockery.

I meant that a Viking "blot" would not be a religious service because there is
nobody *anywhere* today who believes in Thos & co. It is a *dead* religion and
has been so for at least 600 years. Therefore, nobody should be offended by a
historic re-enactment.

Those present-day people who claim to believe in Thos do not in fact belong
to the ancient Scandinavian religion. They belong to a modern cult which has
appropriated some of the Viking concepts and names of deities. If they claim
to be a continuation of the Viking religion, I seriously believe they don't
know what they are talking about. But of course, if there are people around
who would be offended by a "blot" re-enactment, we should abstain from it.

   I originally posted this to rec.food.cooking, but I was told this group

reading this group for the past two weeks, and I think it's great!
   Anyway I'm taking an English class in which we are reading books from the 
Middle Ages, Renaissance, and Enlightenment periods.  One aspect of the class is
to make a creative project which relates to the material we have read.  Since I 
enjoy cooking, I have decided to bake a variety of foods that represent the
periods.  I would appreciate any suggestions and recipes.  
   The books for the class are:
   _Beowulf_, _Lais of Marie de France_, _The Divine Comedy_ (Dante), _The 
   Canterbury Tales_, _The Price_, _Utopia_, _The Heptameron_, _Don Quixote_, 
   _King Lear_, _The Misanthrope_, and _Candide_.

   I haven't been able to find many direct references to foods in the books I 
have read so far except in _The Canterbury Tales_ where Blancmange is mentioned.
I heard the Blancmange in the Middle Ages was made with almonds, which is 
rather different than the Blancmange found today.  I would love to get a great
recipe of Medieval Blancmange.

   Please E-mail any responses.

Remove the word "law" and insert the word "tradition" and the question becomes
even less black and white.  And harder still on the below-average fighter.
Suppose Lord New-fighter goes up against Multi-Duke Sir Tourney-winner.
Lo, and behold, a miracle!  He gets a clean shot at Multi-Duke's leg and

to give up his own leg.  Personally, I wouldn't.  I define a "point of chivalry"
as giving up an advantage so both fighters are even.  I define "having an
advantage" as being more likely to win the bout.  In the above example,
Multi-Duke is still the mostly likely to win, that means HE has the advantage,
not Lord Newbie.  Am I unchivalrous for not giving up an advantage when I don't
see myself as having one?  I don't think so.  Chivalry is how one's actions
are perceived BY ONE'S SELF.  Others opinions should not matter.  The only
one who has to live with what you do IS you.

The fighters of my barony do just that, and we consider that to be a
point-of-honor as well.

I've heard of two such fights.  Both were ugly.  There's also a nasty
tendancy to up the calibration on the attack and hit the opponent MUCH
harder than is necessary.  But this digresses from the the point-of-chivalry
topic, so....

Agreed.  The fighters in our area have reached the conclusion that the
way to defeat Duke Sir Hasdrubal is to make sure you DON'T take out his leg.
Once he drops to his knees, everything disappears behind his shield except
his sword arm.  It's like trying to fight a snapping turtle!

On the topic of valid criterion, read my much earlier posting "An Alternative
to Crown Tourney" and Brian of Leichester's "Another Alternative" reponse.
But you have a valid point.  At a local event, if it is announced that there
will be a prize for "Most Chivalrous Fighter" you're likely to see an above
average number of points-of-honor.  At a Crown Tourney, you're likely to see
a below average number.  Personally, I think a "Most Chivalrous Fighter" award
is far more meaningful if it is not announced beforehand that there will be one.
I guess the bottom line is, what does each individual fighter get or want to
get out of fighting?

	"Religion can't be part of official SCA rituals"

To what extent is religion forbidden and by whom?  What constitutes an 
official SCA ritual?  I have a problem with the "no religion" rule in that 
somewhere between lots and virtually all of the period music is sacred 
(depends on the period).  using sacred music as part of a "performance" feels 
wrong--not as in imorral, but as in out of place.  We *should* have bands of 
pilgrims singing pilgrim songs.  The king *should* have a chappel royal.  i'd 
like to see mirical plays.  I'd like every court that's held in a hall with 
good accoustics to be prefaced by  a peice or two from an (just one) 
appropriate period. If i ran an saracen event, i'd like to have the prayers 
called.  How much of this would offend people?
The sounds of the middle ages are at least as important as the 
sights, and its one of the things that by and large we do rather badly.

	Are we talking a tournament here or a duel of honor?  The lady whose

	good and honorable fight. ... If this were a duel because someone had 
	affronted my lady's honor then I would not give a point of honor, but 
	would attempt to otherwise honorably defeat my opponent...
	But I've never seen such a fight in SCA, so for me it is a hypothetical 
	question.
 
I have seen such a fight, and the same rules apply.  The lady's honor is 
increased *whether or not her champion wins* and the offender can redeam his 
own honor (which he has smirched by offending the honor of the lady) by 
fighting her champion *whether or not he wins* (in fact, some people think it 
would be in rather poor taste to win under those circumstances)  
This is, of course not a "duel of honor", but simply a special case of 
tournement fighting.  A duel (hm. my american herritage derrives duel from 
'duellum' = latin 'war'; i always though it was related to 'two' where's my 
OED when i need it)   is something else again.  This is usually associated 
with late and/or out of period rapier/fencing/(very late & oop)pistols and 
bears no relation to honor in any form in which i can recongnize it.  I would 
never carry a persons favor in to a duel, and if anyone associated my name/ 
favor/ honor with such a sordid and un-chivalrous thing i would clip his ears 
but good, and i wouldn't need a sword to do it with either.

end of argument, what follows is a digression and can be skipped by 
non-fensers:
	trying to 'recreate' the rapier duel in a tournament setting is 
obviously not going to work.  my proposed scenario is as follows:

	the list-mistress sits in a pavilion with a good view of what ever fun 
stuff is going on; she has paper and pens, an attendant, cool drinks to sip, 
and fruits or little cakes and pies to munch...If one person wishes to fight 
another, he gets his second to help him draft and deliver a formal challange.  
The other accepts (presumably) and gets himself a second of his own.  Then 
they find a marchal, retire to a private spot, and fight.  The marshal then 
brings the names of all concerned together with the role they played and who 
one (or merely survived) to the listmistress, who writes it down and later 
comes up with some interesting statistics (in the meanwhile she has a sip of 
orgeat and another excellent small cake)  Obviously the marshalls will be very 
much in demand (not to mention wanting to fight themselves)  and will have to 
be bribed heavily....

	Similar to my learnings in the East.  "Clear" combined with making sure
no unsuspecting people are anywhere near, before drawing live steel of any
length (as opposed to knives used for eating/cutting things/whatever) is
considered proper.

	In Concordia, I remember people shedding all steel to participate in
arm-wrestling matches (which for some took a while to shed!)  As far as court
goes, the only steel I've ever seen bared (or bared myself) is by bodyguards
of royalty/baron/etc, and then NEVER waved around, usually just held vertical
during procession and throughout the court.

	I think this "acting" is a BAD idea, except perhaps if a) the weapons
are non-edged (aka fake), and b) everyone is told what to expect (including
the non-reality of the weapons) BEFOREHAND (this includes the audience).  One
mistake/fall/putz/slip and the SCA could be in very hot water and bad press.

Good gentles,   (Richad DeLacy again)

        I read with interest the posting by Jeremy de Merstone.  Whereas I
disagree with him on the merits of pageantry and fencing both, He made some
excellent points in a roundabout way.

        Stage Combat needs to be carefully choreographed and rehearsed.  In
the most recent advanced stage combat class I took we spent a half hour working
on choreography for a 1 on 1 fight, then an hour and a half rehearsing it such
that at the end of that time it was nearly ready for performance.  This is just
a single duel by two people who have years of experience.  To get even a two
on two fight to 'performance ready' would take much longer, and anything
like what would happen at a 'coronation coup' should be rehearsed for more like
10-12 hours total before being performed.

        Jeremy's other good point was that the audience and the performers
need to be separated and kept separate.  This is why an audience member jumping
up and trying to join in the action as Henry of Maldon suggested is a bad idea.
However (as Jeremy says) if the autocrat doesn't like the way things are going
they should stop it.  Of course they would have to be 'in' on the plan.  And as
Jeremy pointed out this is all predecated on the assumption that there was a
'plan' : a carefully choreographed and scripted and organized plan - not
"a bunch of people running around with bare steel flying" which the autocrat
should by all means put a stop to.

Message-ID: <890227095140.00000364131@harc.EDU>

Good gentles,
Here is the collection of Birthday Song verses compiled from all the messages
I got in response to my request.  I would like to thank all that contributed to
this effort.  There were several slightly different versions of some verses,
all of which I included - choose your favorite! I took the liberty of arranging
the verses in the order that seemed to suit me... If any out there know verses
which do not appear here, I would be grateful to receive them and add them to
this collection.

      Happy Birthday!

Grief and sorrow fill the air,
Children dying everywhere.
Happy Birthday ...

Plague and famine in the air,
People dying everywhere.
Happy Birthday ...

Doom, destruction, and despair, 
People dying everywhere.
Happy Birthday ...

Gloom and doom and dark despair,
People dying everywhere.
Happy Birthday ...

Fear and gloom and darkness but
No one found out You Know What.
Happy Birthday ...

May the cities in your wake 
Burn like candles on your cake.
Happy Birthday ...

See the women wail and weep.
Kill them all but save the sheep.
Happy Birthday ...

Hear the women wail and weep; 
Kill them all but spare the sheep.
Happy Birthday ...

Rape the women while they sleep,
Kill them all but save the sheep.
Happy Birthday ...

You're a period cook, 'tis true; 
Ask the beetles in the stew.
Happy Birthday ...

Now your jail-bait days are done; 
Let's go out and have some fun.
Happy Birthday ...

May your deeds with sword and axe
Equal those with sheep and yaks
Happy Birthday ...

You must marry very soon; 
Baby's due the next full moon.
Happy Birthday ...

Your servants steal, your wife's untrue, 
Your children plot to murder you.
Happy Birthday ...

They stole your sword, your gold, your house,
Took your sheep but not your spouse.
Happy Birthday ...

Were I sitting in your shoes, 
I'd go out and sing the blues.
Happy Birthday ...

Though you're turning 29, 
Age to you is like fine wine.
Happy Birthday ...

So you're 29 again; 
Don't tell lies to your good friend.
Happy Birthday ...

Now you've lived another year, 
Age to you is like stale beer.
Happy Birthday ...

So another year has past,
Don't look back, they're gaining fast,
Happy Birthday ...

Long ago your hair turned grey; 
Now it's falling out, they say.
Happy Birthday ...

Now you've lived another year, 
And your death is drawing near.
Happy Birthday ...

Now you've reached the age you are, 
Your demise cannot be far.
Happy Birthday ...

Black Death has just struck your town; 
You yourself feel quite run-down.
Happy Birthday ...

It's your birthday; never fear:  
You'll be dead this time next year.
Happy Birthday ...

We brought linen, white as cloud; 
Now we'll sit and sew your shroud.
Happy Birthday ...

Unto the people of the Rialto, greetings from Dagonell the Juggler.

First of all, my apologies to the gentles far outside the East Kingdom's
Western Region who are receiving this.  I have a VERY limited number of choices
for distribution, I can only post to the local site, the city, Western New
York (an area much smaller than the SCA considers it to be) or net-wide.

I did not post the Western Region Seneschal's phone number in my earlier
posting about the official poll because I didn't have it handy at the time.
If you have any questions about the poll, you can reach him by :

		Syr Andreas Hak,
		c/o Herb Kauderer
		6572 Slayton Settlement Road
		Lockport, New York 14094-1137
		1 (716) 434 - 9260

I cannot answer any of your questions, because everything I knew, I posted
to the net.  If you need additional information, you will have to call Hak,
I can't help you.					- Dagonell

Subject: The Etiquette of Dismemberment

The recent postings on "what to do when you've managed to dismember your
opponent" hit one of my buttons as well.  This is something that every
fighter must decide, and the decision can affect the fighter's reputation
for better or worse for *years* after a particularly well (or poorly) timed
action.  What follows is 1) long, 2) my personal opinion, 3) bordering on
philosophical nonsense.  You were warned.  :-)

How a fighter's actions are interpreted depend *entirely* on the motivation
ascribed to the fighter.  I could show a videotape of a fight to two
different audiences and get completely different reactions depending on
whether i named the winner Sir Galahad Pureheart or Lord Rhino the Nervedead.
It is very seldom that a fight is completely unabiguous from start to
finish, especially if it lasts for more than one blow.

Fighters are no less subject to this effect than non-fighter spectators.
As the postings so far on the subject have shown, there is a lot of variety
in outlook even among the fighters themselves.  In fact my persona is one
of those that would be mortally offended (so to speak) should someone
chop off my leg and then "condescend" to continue the fight after removing
their own.  (Of course i have one of those deviant Japanese personae, but
i digress.  :-)  Others clearly have (and are entitled to, i hasten to add)
their own opinions on how to handle the situation.  So, in the immortal
words of the bards, "What's a mother to do?"

The solution that my former squire came up with when faced repeatedly with
the situation of having chopped of someone's limb is pretty simple and
elegant; he asks first.  He says something like, "My lord," (or "My lady,"
as the case might be), "I believe you to be at a disadvantage, and i would
not have it said that I defeated you unfairly.  Do you feel that this is
the case?"  This places the control of the situation with the wounded
fighter, which is the polite thing to do, and politeness and chivalrousness
are very closely related.  Then the wounded fighter could say, "No, the
wound i have is the fair result of a fair contest of skills, and you should
not be deprived of the benefit."  Or, "Though i do feel at a disadvantage,
you should act as your honor dictates." This could conceivably lead to the,
"After you.  No, after *you*," syndrome, but if that is the worst thing
that ever happened in a list i'd be overjoyed.

In the first case above, the *only* polite thing to do is to fight on
without giving up anything. In the second case one should, indeed, do as
ones' honor dictates, having given one's opponent a chance to act nobly.
That is, after all, why we fight.

The problem in an nutshell is that the definition of "chivalrous" depends
entirely on one's culture.  A viking berserk's idea is different from a
Carolingian Frank's is different from a Byzantine's, and so on.  I happen
to feel that one should either give up an advantage all the time or not at
all, but if someone explained that he considered it doing me an honor,
then i would more than likely chose not to be offended.  After all, that
is the reasonable thing to do, and we are all reasonable people
are we not? :-)

Because whether or not i am offended depends on why i think the other
fighter is doing what (s)he is doing.  I have actually caught myself thinking,
"Well, i've just cut this guy's leg off, but he telegraphs all his blows
so i'm pretty sure i can beat him even even if i give up a leg."  No one
knows what i'm thinking, but i always feel just a tiny bit ashamed when
this happens and the crowd cheers my apparent show of "chivalry".  The
distinction is internal, but it is no less real *to me*.  If my opponent
knew what i was thinking at the time i made my decision he could have been,
quite rightly, outraged or at least insulted.  Not having such a benefit,
everyone assumed that i was acting for pure motives.

Ultimately, chivalry is how one's actions are perceived.  Suppose
you see a fighter give up a leg.  That's chivalrous, right?  Suppose (for
the sake of argument) you find out later that it is a Baronial law that
all fighters wearing the Baronial livery are to give up advantages.  Was
the fighter chivalrous, or just doing as she was told?  Does it matter in
the end?  Perhaps this is a "difference that makes no difference".

)     I have couple of questions for the alt.sca.philosophers to consider.
)     The one question is, is it honorable, after wounding your opponent,
)to take an equivalent handicap?  Many people apparently think that it is,
)but I disagree.  This could be interpreted as being dishonorable for a
)number of different reasons.
)     First, it could be seen as an insult to one's opponent: "I didn't
)need to take out your leg to beat you, I can take my own leg too and still
)beat you!" or, alternatively, "I'm taking my own limb so that you'll be
)back in the fight - you don't stand a chance of winning now that you're at
)a disadvantage."

	"Oh dear, I seem to have an advantage.  Well, to keep it a fair
fight, I'll take a simular handicap."

	Makes a difference how you look at it, eh?  If the goal is simply
to win, then taking advantage of a lost limb is not dishonorable, just
silly.  But there are a great number of us for whom the goal is not to
win, or at least not to *just* win, but to have fun, and fight a fair and
honorable fight.
	Giving up an advantage is not to honor your opponent, to enhance
*your* honor.  Whether you win or lose, you have shown that you did not
wish to take advantage of your opponents weakness.  *The goal is not to
win, but to fight well.*
	There are times when giving a point of honor is not practical,
such as when you take someones arm and you are both fighting with two
handed weapons.  The proper (Honorable thing, at least in my book) thing 
to do in such a case would be to offer your opponent a single handed 
weapon, or to ask them to yeild.  Both could be accepted, honorably, 
by the wounded opponent.  (And fights might be safer it things were
done this way too...)  Offering an outnumbered foe one-on-one combat
in a melee is in this spirit as well.


)     Second, it could be seen as an insult to the person whose favor one
)carries.  The fighter can gain a bit of extra personal glory by doing this,
)IF THEY WIN, but they unnecessarily increase the chance that they will lose
)and thus fail to defend and advance the honor of the person for whom they
)fight.  After all, it stands to reason that one won't deliberately take
)unnecessary risks in fighting for anything that's worth fighting for - if
)one isn't fighting to win, then why is one FIGHTING for it?  If the victory
)doesn't count, then why fight for the honor of one's lord/lady instead of
)dancing for it, or whistling for it, or just RESTING for it?

	Are we talking a tournament here or a duel of honor?  The lady whose
favor I carry doesn't care whether I win or lose, as long as I fight a
good and honorable fight.  If all that mattered to her was that I win then
I wouldn't be carrying her favor.  When I give a point of honor on the field
I am enhancing *her* honor as well, just as I would decrease her honor if I
commited some dishonorable act, such as corkscrewing a wounded opponent
("But I took his leg, why shouldn't I be allowed to run around behind him and
kill him from behind???")  If this were a duel because someone had affronted
my lady's honor then I would not give a point of honor, but would attempt
to otherwise honorably defeat my opponent, not giving up any advantages gained.
But I've never seen such a fight in SCA, so for me it is a hypothetical 
question.
	As for the rest of your example, why *of course* one can dedicate 
a dance to your consort, or perform a song in their honor, or even (I suppose)
*sleep* in her honor (though my lady prefers more... *active* tokens of respect
:-)  All of these are valid, but they lack the romance of beating someone 
up for them.... :-/
	If all you are out there to do is beat people up, you shouldn't
be out there.


)     And it could even be interpreted as being unfair, because it deprives
)one's opponent of the opportunity to have a credible victory in the fight:
)"He didn't really win, his opponent GAVE him the victory."

	I don't know any fighters who think this way.  Defeating an 
opponent who has a disadvantage is by no means certain.  I've even seen 
situations where giving up a leg makes sence... you are simply acknowledging
that your opponent will do so, so lets save time and pain...


)     AND, taking a handicap like this is a cheap and easy way to seem
)honorable.  After all, nobody is going to think the less of your fighting
)ability for it.  But something is only truly honorable when it ISN'T easy.

	It is only 'cheap and easy' if you are not out to win at all cost.
If you *are* trying to win, and most of us are, then giving up the advantage 
is *not* cheap.  I don't think that its ease is really a question...


)     Also, one more point: it is unlawful, at least in the East, to fight
)in the Crown Tournament unless one makes an honest effort to win.  The
)practical reason seems to be that this would prevent a group of people
)from conspiring to increase the chance of victory for one member of their
)group, but I think that there must be another reason as well.  And also,
)the Sovereign is always the one who wins, no matter how gallant another
)contestant is percieved by some as having been.  So, is winning ONLY
)meaningful in the Crown Tournament?  And if so, then what makes it a
)valid criterion by which to choose our Sovereigns?

	Someone has already pointed out the other reason for this rule.
The fact that the Sovereign is *only* the person that wins is something
that we have discussed before, and does seem to be a disadvantage to
our method of selection, in that it rewards (if a year of travel and
the accompanying responcibilities is a reward) winning to the point that
winning becomes the only important thing.  As long as there is no dishonorable
conduct in the list then it is valid, but dishonorable conduct (rhinohiding
counts) weakens the process.

 
)     The other question is, under what circumstances is it fair to accuse
)a rival, or an opponent in an argument, of having been unfair/discourteous
)to you?  Such an accusation could itself be used as an unfair tactic if
)you're in any way misrepresenting what your rival/opponent said or did -
)the perfect ad hominem attack.  This is a more hypothetical question, but
)I think it is one worth considering.

	I'm afraid that I don't follow you here.  The idea seems foreign to 
my participation in SCA...

Subject: Dealing with beginners

In Digest 256, Flashback describes a "worst of all possible worlds" example of
meeting the SCA. I wish that I could say that that doesn't happen; sadly, it
does. Carolingia has been discussing these problems for a while, and I've
developed some strong opinions (please note that these are not "official"
opinions of either the Barony or of the Demo Committee therein).

    First and foremost, there is the problem of over-reliance on the "outreach"
person for the group (Flashback calls this person the "hospitaller"; I'll use
"Magister", which is the Carolingian term). There is a *very* strong tendency
for people, when encountering a new person, to tell that person to go find the
Magister or Seneschal. If the Magister isn't there, the reaction, all too often,
is simply, "Oh, well, that's too bad". This attitude *rots*. It is *everyone's*
responsibility to help new people; it's simply too big, and too important, a
job to foist off onto one or two people. The Magister can't be everywhere, and
can't take responsibility for everyone at once. Do your part.

    Attitude is an important part of dealing with new people. If you encounter
someone you don't know, be nice to them. If you're local, and you don't know
them, odds are that: a) they're new to the Society, or b) they've just moved
into the area. *Don't* just assume one or the other; Murphy's Law dictates that
you will be wrong. (I've seen more people turned off by moving to a new area,
and getting treated as a novice for six months...)

    Talk to them. Find out what they're interested in; you may find that you
have some common interests. If not, you at least have a better idea of who 
*might* be the right person for this person to meet now. Don't, please don't,
tell them that the first step in getting involved with the SCA is sending
their $20 to California. Frankly, that's the *last* step in getting involved;
that's what you do after deciding that, yes, this is where you belong. TI is
intellectually interesting, but tells a novice next to nothing about what the
Society is actually about...

Remember: a group without fresh blood coming in is dying, if not already dead.
New members provide much (I'd say most) of the *energy* of the Society, and
that energy is important to all. Helping to keep the Society alive and vital
is everyone's responsibility.

Subject: live steel

My gentles all, those who read these words please listen, as I
beg your indulgence.

Please take a deep breath!  Please relax!  I wish to calm the flames
which have started on the issue of bare/live steel, especially at
coronation.

Could all the people who are upset by this issue PLEASE stop flaming.

NOONE in the SCA believes that endangering other members of
the SCA is "good", "fun", or "nice".  So please stop assuming
that people who stage a "scene" are trying to hurt people.

NOONE is trying to defend the concept that innocent bystanders 
should be hurt.  So think a bit more about what is happening and
what you think should happen.

Some people think that good fun does include a staged scene, where, 
to increase the "fun", live steel should be used.  As one who has done
this (three of us staged mortal combat over presumed insults for an SCA
wedding reception), and as one who has seen "violent" coronations (a
large armed guard of 20 people blew open the doors of the court and
marched, a-clanking up to the throne - it gives new meaning to the
phrase "who is it that comes armed into the court of King XXX"), I have
some personal experience with this kind of thing in the SCA, and I want
to allay the fears of the general reader of this great Rialto.

In general, an SCA person knows a lot more about what to do in a
violent "staged" demonstration than a random collection of people.
(Yes, I know, some people may be at their first event, etc, etc.)  This
means that such a demonstration is SAFER in an SCA context than in many
other contexts.  Common sense says that if you see someone waving
steel, and you know it's part of a staged presentation, you step back
and give them room, since that will also give you a better chance to
see.  Even children (haflings?) in the SCA know what to do when they
see swords waving around, because they've seen it at tournaments.

I AM concerned about the case where "people were bouncing through the
crowd waving live steel".  If that happened exactly as described (and I
have only heard about it, not seen it - no criticism of the witness is
intended), and if the people doing the bouncing were a danger to the
people in the crowd, then those people who did it should be taken 
gently aside and firmly told that they should use a bit more common 
sense.  Doing this in private will have a much larger impact than
doing it in public, because the person might be willing to listen
in private, whereas they will most certainly defend their position
in public.

PLEASE, please, I beg of you all - noone should shout "HOLD" in a
crowded hall just because they are outraged by the concept of staged
violence.  Such a shouted command should be reserved, completely and
correctly for those situations where there is DANGER to life and/or
limb.  That's what that command was invented for and should be used
for.  I, for one, when staging my live-steel combat would have WELCOMED
such a cry, if there was danger.  Otherwise, interfering in a staged
(violent or non-violent) presentation in any way, be it a guild
presentation, a baronial court, a calligrapher's presentation of "pen
mightier than sword" or whatever can only bring shame on the person
doing the interrupting.  Everyone else was having fun, why should one
person ruin it for everyone else?

If you feel that violence at a coronation, or that a staged live steel
combat under rehearsed and controlled conditions is not appropriate,
then BITE YOUR LIP, wait until it is OVER, and then, as a courteous and
polite person SHOULD DO, go up to those who staged it, or who requested
it for the event, and make your informed and strongly felt OPINION
known.  Thats the correct thing to do, and the correct way to have
the strongest impact on how/if it is done in the future.  If you have
the feeling that it is PLANNED for an event, then talk to the people 
doing the organizing BEFORE the event!  And do so long enough in advance
that they can change things to suit your opinions if they can/choose to.
If worse comes to worse, don't go to the event and write a letter of
protest to the person responsible for that event.  Vote with your
reasoned opinions, not with raw-rash-emotional outbursts.

Please also remember that the readers of the RIALTO are a minority
of the SCA people, and that many of your SCA friends do not read this
set of missives.  You might do someone a favor and print these out
and show them to friends in the SCA, if you think something intelligent
has been said in this forum.

One last thing - new regulations should not be invented to cover this
series of items.  The world we live in (mundane place that it is)
already has too many laws.  For me, that's one of the attractive parts
of the SCA (dream) - there are fewer laws, and one is more free to do
what one wants.  If the mundane world intrudes too heavily in the SCA,
I'll join some other fantasy organization that permits me to do what I
want, not what someone else thinks I should do.

Greetings good friends!

I just returned from South Africa and have finally 
read most of my mail.
I had some interesting mail inviting me to a meeting 
of the Canton of the Towers - can someone tell me what is a Canton
and is Plum Island ,Mass part of it (my apologies to nonCarolingians
for whom this Question is of little interest.)?
Also , does Carolingia have a designated campsite at Pennsic?
Look forward to seeing some of you again now that I'm back,

When I was Constable in the Mists, there was an ironclad rule about NO BARE
STEEL EVER at revels -- at tourneys, it was tolerated outside the Eric,
especially in pavilions, and away from crowds, but still frowned upon.

If the Marshallate and whatever passed for Constabulary in the East is
not breaking heads on this subject, pointing out to them that if any
20th-Century law-critter happens to walk into the place while these
shennanigans are going on, there are going to be mass arrests for assault
with a deadly weapon and intent to kill may wake them up!

There is no excuse whatever for bare steel in a crowd -- ever!!

The fourth member of the BoD (replacing Harald of Breakstone in '71-'72)
Fr. Ruthven (pronounced 'Riven') of Rockridge, aka David Green, an
Episcopal priest.  At most weekend tourneys and some Sunday revels, he
would say Mass (generally from the 1585 Prayerbook) _in conjunction with_,
but not as part of Society events.

No one was compelled to attend, but all were welcome.  I had the privilege
of serving as his deacon on several occasions.  His position in the Society
was based on his personality and his service to the Kingdom, not on any
ecclesiastic preferrment.  Everyone who knew him liked him (if not always
his puns! :-).

Various Pagan groups also held services, revels, etc., of one sort or
another at tourneys, too -- also "to the side".  I remember one "pan-Pagan"
blessing of the King in 1971 or so, after which it was decided that all
religious doings should be "off-stage" -- no fuss, just a quiet consensus.

I agree that in the _real_ middle ages, bishops, etc. were very powerful
figures -- not always for good, however!  As for me, I prefer that religion
stay "off-stage" in the Society, for the reasons that Wm stated.

Subject: Comments on Recent Postings

>From Baron Steffan ap Cennydd, GREETINGS!
Well, it's happened again. I just finished reading 2 hours of digests and I
have a few comments....

BRETON NAMES: Arval, there used to be an ex-Carolingian living in Poughkeepsie
(Valcor [?]) named Sorcha dubh ingen Domhnall ar Menez. If anyone knows her
current location, she's you girl. She *speaks* Breton. And Middle Welsh. And
Old Irish. And even Gaulish (well, as much as anyone does....).

KNIGHTING ARCHERS AND FENCERS: Want some history? King AElfwine and Queen
Arastorm wanted to encourage archery, which was practiced but practically
unrecognized in the East. So they asked their principal herald (me [why do
they always ask the herald these things]) if they could create an order for
it. Sure, you're the Crown, says I. So they do. And there was much
consternation. The Order of the Pheon is created by Edict. It's ratified by
Curia and becomes statutory. It's armigerous. It's made non armigerous. It's
closed. It's abolished. It's revival is dicussed in Curia. I suggest that
service to archery should earn a Crescent, excellence in Archery arts
(bowyers/fletchers) should earn a Manche, superior archery skill should earn a
Tygers Combattant. That idea is adopted, sort of. (Actually what they did was
re-write the statutes so that the OSC was for "service...and archery", etc.
Sheesh.) The order is revived as the Sagitarrius. It's non-armigerous. It's
made armigerous. The fencers say "what about us". So *that's* disscussed in
Curia. The answer is no. Then it's yes. So we get the Guardsmen, a
non-armigerous order, which will probably go armigerous at some future Curia.
I'm sick of it, personally, and I don't want to go through this again,
certainly not at the Society-wide level. We can't have awards for every bloody
activity. (Hey, how about one for Heraldry? And cooking! And embroidery! And
persona development! And photography!) Actually we *had* one for costuming and
look what happened to that. (Say "Order of Fatima" to any Easterner who's been
around longer than Hasdrubal I, then run away.)

FEALTY: Mistress Cher touched on my views when she mentioned "the other side
of the Chivalry coin", i.e. fighting that which is wrong, taking a stand
against Evil and risking being considered "unchivalrous". Now, most SCA folk
seem to think of fealty as a one-way street. You swear fealty and that means
you are a piece of dogmeat that your Lord and Master can abuse, even
mundanely. All too often I've heard folk offer their lives and all their
property and that of all their dependents, with nothing in return, under
penalty of having Thor turn them into smoking cinders. I figure that's why a
lot of folk balk at swaering fealty. But fealty is a *contract*, and it works
two ways. Trust me, I know from experience! I once challenged the king to live
up to his part of the bargain (to protect my estates) after I had a neighbor
shire steal a Relic. In my fealty oath, I swear to (a) be "the King's maan, of
life and limb [I fight at Pennsic] and earthly worschip [I owe him respect],
to offer true counsel [to tell him when he's screwing up] and to bear true
faith to the Crown [to consider myself a loyal subject of the East]." By
accepting the oath, he agrees to listen when to me when I give him advice. My
obligation is to risk his wrath when necessary, rather than to meekly go along
with what I consider an unwise course....I maintain that this is all a period
attitude. I'll leave you wwith a real, period fealty oath:
        "For a year and a day, I promise not to remove any of the limbs of
         your body, nor sack your cathedral".
I'm not making that up.

Subject: Christianity/paganism

Greetings gentles from Juliana of Felding, Carolingia!

For those interested in the relationship of paganism and Christianity during the 
Middle Ages/Early Renaissance, I recommend two books:

1. Keith Thomas, _Religion and the Decline of Magic_.

A very fascinating books that examines pagan practices that the Church ignored 
(such as cunningmen and cunningwomen) and pagan elements in Catholic doctrine 
and practice (such as the cult of the Virgin).

2. Carlo Ginzburg, _The Cheese and the Worms_.

*Warning*  Check this one out of the library.  As a work of historical analysis, 
it is heavily biased by the author's Marxist beliefs.  My professor and I agrees 
that in that respect, the book was a waste of paper.  However, the story does 
provide an example of popular misconceptions in religion, the real inquisition 
process, and the concequences of heresy.  

medieval christianity/paganism:

To properly critique the relationship of paganism and Christianity, one must 
remember that medieval Christianity was very different from catholicism today.  
Doctrine was based less on the Bible (OT&NT) that on tradition, which is where 
the ideas of saints, purgatory, relics, etc. came from.  The popedom functioned
as a political as well as spiritual force in, particularly with Innocent III's 
claims to power with such documents as the Donation of Constantine.  Also, it
is important to distinguish popular religion from that of the clergy.
The mass was in Latin at that point and doctrine was not explained in explicit 
terms to the common people, and even if it was, it is doubtful that they could 
understand the complexities of the issues.

There is definitely a lack of religiosity in our re-creation of the 
Middle Ages which is unfortunate because the Church played an extremely 
important role in that time period, in terms of popular mentality.  However, I 
do not want a restricting religious persona, and I wouldn't expect it of another 
person.

Subject: Points of Honor

    Henry of Malden (Alex Clark) asks "is it honorable, after wounding your
opponent, to take an equivalent handicap?", and continues on, giving examples
that fairly obviously support his opinion that it is not.  It seems his
opinion is based on the concept that the idea behind SCA fighting is to win.

    This managed to press one of my hot buttons, but fortunately Chelidon o
Gaeddrych (Richard C. Hoffman) got an answer into the same Digest that says
much the same things I wanted to say, so I won't repeat the same things over
again.  But, for an additional thought on the subject:  I have seen the giving
of a point of honor, i.e. giving up the limb you have taken on your opponent,
become so much the expected thing that someone who does not is whispered
about, with overtones of "what's wrong with him/her, they won't give up their
arm/leg", etc.  When I have taken someone's limb, it is usually because I have
worked hard for it, to gain an advantage.  If I am having a particularly good
time in this bout, I may give up a limb of my own, so as to prolong my
pleasure, but it is not, and should not be, a normal, expected occurance.  As
far as I am concerned, it is a sign of particular respect to my opponent, that
I wish to keep the fight on an even basis for as long as possible, because I
am having fun, which is what we should all remember on the field - we are
there to have a good time, and while winning may be good, losing well can be
even better - some of the best times I've had in tourney have come in fights I
eventually lost.

Richard DeLacy is correct in saying that Henry of Maldon's suggestion
would be dangerous, etc.   On the other hand, he totally ignores the fact
that Henry was commenting on the situation described in Lady Orianna
vander Delft's original posting:

This does NOT sound like everyone within range of steel was "in on the
performance", which the "having any sense whatsoever" rule would certainly
mandate.  Some sort of action would have to be taken, and in such a case
it would be the person stopping it who would be better off "dropping
character". Our very mundane SCA Insurance is predicated on rattan-fights
in controlled lists and fields, not on swinging live steel in a crowd, and
this should be forcefully pointed out *by the person-in-charge* (autocrat,
seneschal, kingdom official, etc.), because it will most assuredly be
pointed out by the insurance company if the claims start rolling in.
There's enough complaining about how the cost of a year of SCA membership
is *too high* (about the same as four first-run movie tickets or three
large pizzas or a half of a college textbook, but I digress [as usual]).

Now I don't necessary want to spoil the pageantry (though the coups being
represented would have hardly prompted rejoicing or "entertainment" in
most of the historical Middle Ages), but are some guidelines which MUST be
followed if such an occurrence of "staged violence" is to appear in an SCA
context:

Considering that even such non-dangerous [:)] ceremonies as weddings
require rehearsals for those actually participating, it would seem a bare
MINIMUM safety requirement would be to keep the "participants" in the
staging physically separate from the audience, and well-rehearsed in
ensuring that they stay that way;  some sort of training in how to *look*
like one is flourishing a sword while actually not moving it in any way
that it could come loose with any velocity *at all* would be appropriate
as well.

Now, I will assume that Richard DeLacy and those who agree with him that
"staged violence" can be a fun addition to court will accept that these
minimum safety guidelines (and possibly others, which might be either
general or situation- dependent) are necessary and should be *strictly*
adhered to, even to the point of binding "HOLD!" calls in the case of
their breach.  I will also assume (though perhaps less confidently) that
those currently arguing vehemently against "staged violence" primarily on
safety grounds will accept some set of (potentially very very strict)
safety guidelines, and see to it that they are indeed enforced.

This brings us back to the original thrusts of the discussion:
(1) WHY are there no guidelines or enforcement procedures in place ? and
(2) Is any of this "staged violence" necessary or appropriate at all ?

Clearly the answer to (1) is that not enough people have thought about it
enough;  this discussion on the net would be a good start for some
kingdom-level thinking. I'd hesitate to involve the BoD just yet, except
for the insurance and potential litigation problems;  perhaps just a
policy that the kingdoms should be required to come up with safety
guidelines... this opens up a can of worms, though in that it would be a
sort of implied consent, whereas it would be technically easier for the
BoD to simply ban such displays outright and have done with it, so that if
an accident were to occur, the BoD could say: "this was not an official
Society-authorized activity; in fact, the SCA expressly forbids it, and
the officers of the group *know* that, and they let it happen anyway, so
*they* are *personally responsible* for damages".   If the BoD were to
expressly allow the activity under some safety guidelines which were to
prove inadequate in some way, the *SCA* would be in trouble.  I'm behind
on reading BoD policy statements, so I don't know if the BoD has even got
a policy on this sort of thing at the moment.
At the very least, if a group *is* planning a show, it would be wise to
discuss what precautions must be made to keep the non-participants out of
dangerous situations.

Now the answer to (2) is mainly a matter of opinion.  Mine is that in
*most* cases, the answer is "no".   As a rare occurrence, a "showpiece" for
one event every few years or so, I wouldn't object strenuously, though,
especially if it is made very clear to all involved, participants *and*
non-participants just what was going to happen, where the places for each
in the ceremony were to be, and so on.  [At a MidRealm Coronation long
ago, there was a re-enactment of the life & reign of Harold II of England,
on a *large* scale (rattan weapons were used for the battles with Harald
Hardrada & William of Normandy); this was fun and spectacular, but not a
thing one would want to perform {or sit through :-)} at EVERY Coronation].

Something that has just come to mind and I can't resist:  As most of you
know, acceptance of fencing in the Middle Kingdom is low.  I recall a
MidRealm Knight (I don't recall which one it was for sure) saying long ago
when the topic was making its *first* go-around (1977? 78?) something to
the effect of
"If we let people in with REAL swords, they'll only want to USE them!"
It would appear that his concerns have been realized [one could gloat that
it hasn't happened in the MidRealm because we've kept the fencers in their
place (i.e. noplace:-), but I don't think that would be either true or
fair], although the "where will it all end ?" argument against any sort of
change at all is not uncommon in the SCA or in the world as a whole;  I
present it as a humorous anecdote rather than as prescience or prophecy.
Rattan fighters around here get the "no offensive steel" business drilled
into them early and often -- even though many have nice "real"
broadswords, kitanas, etc., one just doesn't see such weapons unsheathed &
out in the open much. Not having much experience with SCA-fencing (aside
from two demos which failed to convince the powers-that-were), I don't
know if SCA-fencers get the same sort of indoctrination in the appropriate
time and place for unsheathed weaponry. I would imagine that they do.  Of
course, swinging rattan weapons or replica claymores around in a Court
situation would get a big "NOT IN HERE YOU DON'T" around here, too, so
it's not really a case of steel-vs-rattan;  more like good vs bad manners,
and good vs bad "stage" preparation.

Well I've gone on way too long already... back to the old grindstone!

	I believe it was "The Horizon Book on the Middle Ages" (sort of like
an encyclopedia) which gave an account of one humble personage crumbling up
the blessed host and sprinkling it in his garden in order to kill the
caterpillars.  They also gave a couple of examples of priest who weren't much
better . . . .
	Seriously, I think there is a point to the arguement about parents
freaking over rumors of "religous cult".  Remember--it's not facts which tend to
do the most damage, it's gossip.  Equally unfortunately, ignorant people tend
to be in positions of power.  (Before you doubt this, think about how many
incidents of cop-harassment there have been when they encountered someone
dressed in period while coming from or going to a function.)  I personally
would *love* to see a recreation of the arguments which debated how many angels
danced on the head of a pin, or whether women had souls, but it would have to
be done *very* carefully.  Ah, well, such is life . . . .

Good evening all,
  
    Once again I venture forth on the subjects of households.
Justin: The things you described don't sound terribly like the type of house
holds it has been my (mis)fortune to to meet. Though the service household
sounds like a terribly scarey concept, just in terms of possibility for abuse,
a single group controlling the most of the offices in a shire/barony etc. is
not a good thing. I am a pessimist when it comes to my expectations of human
motivations (I find that I am not disappointed as often) and what you are
talking about is a lot of power, which in the wrong hands can really hurt a lot
of people. 
     The households I am used to are, in general, groups of people who got
together at some point and do things together. They are generally not organized
around a central theme but more on personal acquaintance. Entry is dependant
upon whether or not the heads of the household like you or not. Often there are
viscious political inter and intra house squabbles. If they are in a small
shire they occaisionally attempt to control all the offices there. All in all
rather a nasty picture, what you described sounded more like unofficial guilds.

     Whether or not households are officially recognized is immaterial, if they
are not recognized then they will just become informal. Households can be
tremendously useful, they can support newbies, provide all the equipment that
makes an event less stressful at a low cost, make managable sub-groups, etc.
There for what can be done to limit the abuses a household can perform. Most of
the problems seems to come from exclusion. A beutiful confident young woman who
can weave, cook, and play the harp is not likely to be excluded from any group
she indicates a desire to join, but a shy funny looking rather geeky male who
is a total clutz is gonna face a wall of rejection. Some of the most impressive
people in the society I have ever met were once geeky young total clutzez, we 
cannot allow them to be turned off from the SCA. It is wrong to make a
household accept anyone who comes knocking, to do so alienates the household,
so I profer as a suggestion trying to make the group less reliant upon
houshold.

     I suggest encouraging an active and useful hospitallar, someone who can
grab newbies and show them what to do. I encourage sewing circles, armour
making parties etc. on a group level, things such as the minister of arts and
sciences organizes,they should be announced to all, explictly stating that 
everyone is welcome, regardless of experience. 

this is entirely too long already, but it is a subject meriting sreious
consideration.

Blades:
     It has always been my understanding that the only people allowed in the
presence of thier majesties with live steel were knights and the champions.
Almost everyone in the society has a fascination with sharp pointy things, and
almost all of us bear at least one piece of live steel on us, some several more
(I remember on gentle who provided feasting knives for 12 people from what he
carried on him at all times.) But there are those whose brain seems to take a
vacation when they pick up a sword. Almost as annoying are the people who act
like startled ducks when you pull a sword out of a scabbard and immediatly
^order^ you to "put that thing away.

Subject: blades in coronation

Good Gentles,  Richard DeLacy once more begs your ear,
         Although I have already posted my opinions on the matter, I find I
must respond to something I read this morning on the topic of blades at
coronations.  Please bear with me - I almost didn't finish reading the rest of
the digest before responding, but I got control of myself and spent a half-hour
reading before finally feeling calm enough to write semi-coherently.

NOOOOOOO!!!!!!! (my that felt good)

That is the most dangerous, foolish, and discourteous thing that you could
possibly do.  If the people involved 'have any sense whatsoever' their only
response is to drop character and ask you to leave - totally ruining the effect
of what they are doing: entertaining the people present.  Of course the proper
response on their part (in persona) is to kill you, but if you are being
bullheaded enough to do something as stupid as interrupting a performance in
progress then you probably won't accept their word for it that you are dead.

        Let me say again - interrupting any performance of any kind is rude and
foolish, but interrupting a performance with any kind of staged violence is
dangerously stupid as well.  If it were my coronation I would (and quite
rightly in period) banish you from my kingdom for such an act.

Subject: Courtesy Copies (from William de Corbie)

    But apart from the 20 paid copies, I am also required to send courtesy
    copies to: 

    -King and Queen
    -Kingdom Seneschal
    -Kingdom Chronicler
    -Principality Chronicler
    -Prince and Princess
    -Heirs to the Coronet
    -Principality Seneschal
    -Principality Historian

The copy to the Chronicler and Principality Chronicler serve in lieu of your
report as an officer of your group.  The copies to the Senechals help them know
what is going on in your group (otherwise Countess Aidan would never know that
there are new cantons in Nordmark springing up!)  Copies to the Royalty keep
them aware of those gentles who are doing things worthy of awards.  The
Historian is a Principality requirement not duplicated at Kingdom level.

    Also, it would be considered disourteous not to send copies to:

    -Baron
    -Barony chronicler
    -Barony seneschal
    -Heirs (Kingdom)

While I was the baronial chronicler for Settmour Swamp (for 2-1/2 years), I did
NOT send courtesy copies to the Baron, or any of the baronial officers.  I felt
it was their OBLIGATION to support their own group by PAYING for the news-
letter!  I am resident in the Incipient Canton of Marwick in the Barony of
Settmour Swamp, and although both of the chroniclers of those groups are
required to send us their newsletters, I also PAY for them.  If your group
can't afford these extra copies, it is not discourteous to leave the Baronial
officers off your list.

    All in all, this makes *at least* 12 courtesy copies, or more
    than one third of the total number of copies. I hardly need to
    point out that this is a very hard strain on my resources, and
    ups the production cost of the newsletter considerably.

As a former baronial chronicler, I always felt that it was the financial
responsibility of the group to put out the newsletter.  Since it is quite often
impractical to make subscription fees balance production and mailing costs, if
you can't afford it, then perhaps you can hold fund raisers or get some
financial help from your group?  Unfortunately, groups within Principalities
are one level deeper in bureaucracy, one level deeper in officers and Royalty.

    The problem with courtesy copies is that the system strikes
    hardest against the weakest. Those at the bottom of the feudal
    pyramid must send copies to all the levels above (barony,
    principality, kingdom) while I guess the kingdom chronicler
    doesn't need to send copies to anyone except King & Queen and a
    couple of officers. (I am not sure of this, correct me if I'm
    wrong.)

Alas, here you are COMPLETELY incorrect.  Using the Pikestaff (the East Kingdom
Newsletter) as an example: we send out NO courtesy copies at all.  The Royalty
MUST be members and have access to the Kingdom newsletter, as well as all the
Kingdom officers.  Our subscription list is a direct function of the membership
of the kingdom - we get funds from corporate, to pay for the production and
mailing of Pikestaff.  (Pikestaff is the largest Kingdom newsletter in terms of
subscription base - we're over 2150 monthly copies, at this point.)

    But seriously, what can be done about this? Is it *necessary* for
    all the people above to get free copies? Wouldn't it make more
    sense to send the newsletters to the superior chroniclers only? 

First, let me remind you that shires/cantons are not required to publish
newsletters, they're not even required to have chroniclers.  If you can't make
ends meet, explain this to your canton, and perhaps it might be time to cut
back on the size of your newsletter? Second, you should continue to discuss the
problem with your Principality Chronicler, before you make any long term
decisions.

William, if you wish to continue this discussion privately, I can be reached
via internet mail as PIKESTAFF@RUTGERS.EDU, or LECIN@ELBERETH.RUTGERS.EDU (as
well as via CompuServe and MCI MAIL.)

Yours in service to the Eastrealm,

From my understanding of it, there is only one "Great Household," the Dark
Horde, and the BOD considered the status to be a mistake and ceased granting
such a status. Then again, my information may be dated.

Message-Id: <sY16Fby00Uw-E4Z3Iq@andrew.cmu.edu>

Groups which practice archery indoors during the winter often find themselves
limited to 20 yard ranges, and unable to practice the longer ranges.  A solution
to this problem is to set up a mirror at the far end of the range and place the
target behind you.  This gives you an effective range of 40 yards.  (Or, if you
have a 40 yard range, this will give you a 75-yard target.)

The key word would appear to be "courtesy".  It hardly seems reasonable to
bankrupt yourselves sending copies to people who get so much SCAdian junk mail
that they don't have time to read your newletter in any case.

Suppose you cut the distribution list of courtesy copies to those people who can
reasonable be expected to *read* the things?

From: mjc@nl.cs.cmu.edu  (Monica Cellio)
Subject: Complimentary newsletters
Message-Id: <4341@pt.cs.cmu.edu>

William de Corbie explains that the East Kingdom requires local chroniclers 
to send a large number of complimentary copies (principality and kingdom
chroniclers, seneschals, royalty, etc) and asks if there is anything that
can be done to ease this burden on smaller groups.

Perhaps a partial solution to the problem can be managed by taking advantage
of the system of regional/principality chroniclers and seneschals.  In theory,
regional and principality chroniclers oversee the publications in their area,
help local chroniclers with any problems they may have, make sure everyone
"follows the rules" (e.g. putting in the disclaimer), and so on.  Thus, they
need to see the newsletters as they are published.  If a regional chronicler 
isn't doing his job, I guess the kingdom chronicler would have to step in, 
and for that he would need to have copies.  But that shouldn't be the typical 
case.  (I assume that seneschals get copies for similar reasons.  I'm not 
sure.)

But, in most cases the kingdom officers don't need to see the newsletters
right away, and the regional officers make quarterly reports.  So what about
having local chroniclers send to the regional chronicler and seneschal, but
NOT to the kingdom officers?  Then the regional chroniclers/seneschals could
include these issues with the report.  (In the case of Drachenvald, I suspect
that overseas mailing causes substantial delays for the kingdom officer copies
anyway.)

(I guess the comments about seneschals only apply to principalities; I've
never been asked to send copies to my regional seneschal.  But, outside of
principalities, maybe the *local* seneschal could just include the newsletters
with his quarterly report to the kingdom seneschal.)

Would this solution cause any major problems for the kingdom chronicler or
seneschal?

In a similar vein, does your principality historian need to get the copies
right away?  Or could you send him a bundle every six months?  (I'm assuming
that your major expense is postage, rather than printing.)

This, unfortunately, only takes care of three of the twelve copies you have
to send out each month.  But it's a start.  (Royalty really should receive
the copies as they come out, if they're going to derive any benefit from
them.)

This is an expense that every group publishing a newsletter has to bear.
Note that I said *groups* have to bear the cost.  In a group as small as yours,
you could probably argue that it is unreasonable to make the subscribers
bear the cost, when the group as a whole has the burden.  Perhaps some of 
the profits from events could go toward paying for these extra copies?  Ask
your officers about it.

No sense at all, if the most important thing the SCA can have to offer you is a
forum for you to develop a fantasy persona.  It's a matter of where the line
should be drawn.  At first glance, the persona of a human out of Middle Earth
(just an example, don't get insulted) would seem to fit into the SCA better than
a Victorian persona.  But that's mostly because we have inherited a literary
fantasy tradition which (with the aid of sloppy research) makes it easy to
imagine that what we read in fantasy novels is close to "what the middle ages
were like".

If having a persona from a fantasy milieu is that important to you, why do it in
the SCA?  It would seem to be equally appropriate in a Civil War reenactment
group.

This is a definite non-issue--indeed, most traditional church garb is
just fine for SCA use.  It is solidly made and appropriate in color and
style for period wear.  This shouldn't surprise anyone.  After all, the
traditional habits and vestments *started* as the everyday clothing of
their periods.  The vestments got a little fancier while habits got a
little plainer.  Some years ago there was an Episcopal priest in the
local group who wore a good monkish habit routinely.  Not only was it
of period style--but it was a stout wool cloth, to boot.

The previously mentioned priest used to do mass in an out-of-the-way
corner of the field using period texts and hymnals.  those who were of

I know a few people who consider themselves pagans that might take 
exception to this statement!  (Most of them profess to be goddess-worshipers,
but the principle is the same.)

Length of posting is no problem where there is sufficient content--which

You say that a Viking "blot" would not be a religious service because nobody
believes in the rites, but you also state that holding a Christian ceremony
would be sacrilege if there were those present who did not believe.  I'm sorry
if I'm missing something of fundamental importance, but what's the difference
here, except for the fact that Christianity is more widely practiced?  There's
going to be a Feast of Esther/Purim Revel somewhere in my general area (I
forget exactly where).  Purim is a Jewish holiday; should non-Jews be banned
from the event because their presence would be sacrilege?

As one who claims no (mundane) religion, then, am I to be banned from
partaking in Christian ceremonies but not from others?  Can't a Christian
ceremony be seen as a "learning activity" also?

Just as an aside:  you say, "... or any other religion that people today
believe in."  I know a couple of people mundanely who (claim to) believe in
the Norse gods.  (My personal feeling is that they claim this only because
it's "in vogue" among New-Agers - something I disapprove of - but they *do*
claim to believe in it.)

Message-ID: <890224172449.11.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

Reading the recent discussion about firearms in the SCA, I remembered
a story I heard a couple of years ago:

As you may or may not know, there is a ship called "Wasa" in Stockholm.
This was a mighty warship built i the reign of Gustavus Adolphus, intended
to be like the most important ship in the Swedish navy. However, there was
a disaster and it sank on its maiden voyage on august 10, 1628. The wreck
was lifted in the 1960's and put in a museum, where it is now an important
spectacle for tourists.

The cannons from Wasa have also been lifted and restored to their original
shape, and are sometimes used to fire salutes. Now, some years ago there
was a big Swedish PR campaign in the USA and one of the Wasa guns was to
be used in the opening ceremony. They put the gun on an airplane together
with some people from the Wasa museum and flew over.

But when they got to America they were told that the cannon was considered
"military equipment" and could not be unloaded at a civilian airport. 
The rules said that military equipment should be unloaded at a military
airport - to which the museum officials could not fly because it was secret.

So the museum people had to get off the plane. The plane lifted and flew
a couple of miles to the military airport where the gun was unloaded and
delivered to the Swedes at the gate (they drove there).

They also needed a special import license for the cannon, and there was
a lot of red tape because import of military equipment is not normally
allowed for anybody outside the military...

So watch out if you have artillery! The US Government may attack you,
throwing books.

In response to the question to what it takes to set up a household.
Congratulations, you are a household. Technically, huseholds have no
official status in the Society. You may register a name and a badge
but if you will notice, it is in an individuals name. The registration
of household names and badges is strictly for the convenience of the
households to be sure that their name and badge don't conflict with
those of other households.

Households are created when more than one individual decides to be a household.
As has been previously discussed there are numerous reasons to be in a
household, all of them just as valid as the others. In this area 
(Tirnewydd-Columbus, Ohio) we have households galor, and many people
join multiple households (there is certainly nothing to keep one from
doing that. 

My own list of households that I either belong to are participate with
is varied.

I am a member of my Knights -Syr Thomas ap Llywellyn - household 
(still nameless) as I am his squire.
	This household is a group of close friends who are together in a
	learning context.

I am a member of Inertia House.
	A sometimes silly group of people, who try to motivate each other
	to do good works for the society.

At war I usually fight with House Vexilarius- Sir Comar gyr Mirands house.
	This is due to the fact that I and my knight practice with him.

The only type of "official" household are Great Households which are defined
as having at least 50 members and crossing kingdom boundries. Some of these
include the Dark Horde, The Crimson Company and The House of the Darkwinds.

I hope this has helped.

Subject: What are Honor and Courtesy?
Message-Id: <73099ABC102@PSUVM>


     I have couple of questions for the alt.sca.philosophers to consider.
     The one question is, is it honorable, after wounding your opponent,
to take an equivalent handicap?  Many people apparently think that it is,
but I disagree.  This could be interpreted as being dishonorable for a
number of different reasons.
     First, it could be seen as an insult to one's opponent: "I didn't
need to take out your leg to beat you, I can take my own leg too and still
beat you!" or, alternatively, "I'm taking my own limb so that you'll be
back in the fight - you don't stand a chance of winning now that you're at
a disadvantage."
     Second, it could be seen as an insult to the person whose favor one
carries.  The fighter can gain a bit of extra personal glory by doing this,
IF THEY WIN, but they unnecessarily increase the chance that they will lose
and thus fail to defend and advance the honor of the person for whom they
fight.  After all, it stands to reason that one won't deliberately take
unnecessary risks in fighting for anything that's worth fighting for - if
one isn't fighting to win, then why is one FIGHTING for it?  If the victory
doesn't count, then why fight for the honor of one's lord/lady instead of
dancing for it, or whistling for it, or just RESTING for it?
     And it could even be interpreted as being unfair, because it deprives
one's opponent of the opportunity to have a credible victory in the fight:
"He didn't really win, his opponent GAVE him the victory."
     AND, taking a handicap like this is a cheap and easy way to seem
honorable.  After all, nobody is going to think the less of your fighting
ability for it.  But something is only truly honorable when it ISN'T easy.
     Also, one more point: it is unlawful, at least in the East, to fight
in the Crown Tournament unless one makes an honest effort to win.  The
practical reason seems to be that this would prevent a group of people
from conspiring to increase the chance of victory for one member of their
group, but I think that there must be another reason as well.  And also,
the Sovereign is always the one who wins, no matter how gallant another
contestant is percieved by some as having been.  So, is winning ONLY
meaningful in the Crown Tournament?  And if so, then what makes it a
valid criterion by which to choose our Sovereigns?

     The other question is, under what circumstances is it fair to accuse
a rival, or an opponent in an argument, of having been unfair/discourteous
to you?  Such an accusation could itself be used as an unfair tactic if
you're in any way misrepresenting what your rival/opponent said or did -
the perfect ad hominem attack.  This is a more hypothetical question, but
I think it is one worth considering.

     I don't know where the Earl Marshall has been, but I suspect that all
of these things have been done with the consent of the Earl Marshall.  I'd
rather not speculate about what this says about the Earl Marshall. :-(  I
haven't been to a Coronation recently, so I don't know about any of this
first-hand, but I do know that if I go to the next one, I'm going to ask
some questions about the "ceremonies," and if I'm not satisfied with the
answers, I'll see if they have enough gall to continue running around
like butchers looking for a chicken to cut off the head of while someone
is crying "HOLD!"
     By the way, if this is unarmored fighting, then one might argue that
it should fall under the jurisdiction of the Marshall of Fence, and the
current Crown Prince was EK Marshall of Fence not so long ago. 8-O

     Agreed.

     This subject brings up another problem: we don't really have any
justification for why the Crown changes hands two or three times a year,
or why the Throne is a musical chair.  Perhaps we wouldn't have this
problem at Coronation if we reconsidered our customs concerning Royalty,
and perhaps made major changes to those customs.
     This suggests to me another idea that might work better than crying
"hold!"  Let another person get in on the act.  If the Crown Prince is
representing himself as an usurper, just step out into an open area, say
"CLEAR!" and draw your sword - and then say that you're going to defend
the King!  If they have any sense whatsoever, that ought to bring them to
their senses.

     Henry, throughout this article you consistently misinterpret the 
point, as I interpret it, of SCA fighting.  I will keep my comments brief
here, since we can discuss this in person, but I truely believe that your
article would have been more informed if you had bothered to talk to any
of the fighters in this shire before you posted (or, if you feel that none
of us fight in a chivalrous enough manner, for who amongst us does not
fall short of the ideal in some aspect or another, you could have asked
someone from Dawnfield, or BMDL, perhaps).

     The point, in my personal opinion as a fighter, of SCA fighting,
is NOT to win.  The honor comes in the fighting itself, the act of
doing your opponent honor by testing your skill at arms against hers or
his.  And, likewise, he or she does you equal honor by agreeing to 
contest against you on the field of battle.
     You mention that by taking one's own limb, a fighter is somehow 
dishonoring the person whose favor s/he carries, by reducing his/her
advantage and making it less likely that s/he will win the bout.  Once
again, I must protest that the point of the bout is not to win, but to
fight.  The giver of a favor honors the recipient, and the recipient
likewise return the honor by wearing the favor into battle.  If the
bout was brought about specifically in order to contest the honor of  
a person whose favor a fighter carried, then I could possibly see an
increased emphasis on winning.  But even in this unusual case, if the
fighter comports him or herself with honor on the battlefield, it 
reflects equally upon the challenge regardless of the outcome.
     Your mention of crown tourney contains another misconception.  A
fighter entered in Crown Tourney must be WILLING to win Crown.  In other
words, fighters are prohibited from entering who are not truly able or
willing to rule if that situation should come about.  The intent of this
prohibition was to prevent fighters from entering with the attitude,
"oh, I'll never win anyway, I'm not good enough, but it'll be a good
fight."  It is entirely within the bounds of probability that such a 
fighter could win, and then the Kingdom would have a reluctant or
perhaps (due to mundane considerations, for example), an incapable
monarch.  If a fighter's attitude is entirely upon the WIN, to the
exclusion of honorable conduct, then he or she does not deserve to be
monarch, in my humble opinion.
     To be truthful, Henry, I do not now have time to fully answer this matter
to my satisfaction.  I will be travelling for a week, and will be returning
next weekend.  I do hope that you will bring this question up with me at
our next shire meeting, and I will attempt to provide, to the best of my
ability, answers which will satify you.

Good evening all,
    How to join the SCA, it is not as easy as most of you think. Consider
Joe Mundane who has heard of our sordid group at some point. He manages to find
out where the local fighter practice is, scrabbles together some sort of
midevil looking getup and shows up. The first thing that happens is he hears a
snort of derision and some one calling "oh I just love your nylon shirt, it
goes marvelously with the nikes". Our hero has no Idea of WHAT they are making
fun of he just knows they are making fun of him, but having great intestinal
fortitude he sallies on-ward, asking a passing person what he does to join they
wave him in a general direction and tell him to talk to the "sin-a-shawl". He
stumbles forward, asking a guy wearing a white belt where the "sin-a-shawl" is,
said guy immeadiatly rebukes him saying "you should use my title when addressing
me." Joe compleatly bewildered mumbles an apology goes on, he manages to find
someone who will finally own up to being the "'shawl". hands him a form and
tells him to send them $20. Joe, being a poor but honest college student is
shocked , that is lunch for a week, and he has no idea of what is going on yet.
Deciding to calm down and watch what is going on he watches two armored tanks
proceed to beet on one annother. This looks fairly interesting so he decides to
take a closer look suddenly people are yelling "HOLD" and "Get off the bloody
field" and various imprecations, the afore mentioned tanks rotate to face him
and he notices that they are carrying awfully large clubs and don't sound
terribly happy. Someone finally notices a newbie in thier midst and grabs him
and pulls him out of the list, and offers him a seat on their spread out they
immediatly lapse into an entirely indecphirable  discussion contain words that
sound like english, but he'll be damned if he can figure out what a
"swishy-poke" or a "rhino-hide" is. He inquires about giving fighting a try and
asks about how much a set of armour like the tanks have will cost, when quoted
a tremendous sum he exclaims "thats more than I paid for books!". They then
tell him that most people make thier own, Joe, being rather inept mechanically
(his thumb still hurts from an incident involving a hammer) is even more
dismayed. When he asks about trying out the fighting they say sure and hand him
some rugs taped together, not sure if this isn't some practicle joke he puts it
on, they then hand him a smelly helm which he puts on also, then they point him
towards a tank the tank smiles, and proceeds to say "first you have to learn
what is a killing blow" and proceeds to hit him over the head with blow that
makes his ears ring. Later stumbling out, in pain, rather humiliated, and
thougly confused he notices everyone is leaving, when Joe asks a passing
stranger he says they are going over to stephanies for "Bardic", joe have no
idea who stephanie is nor where she lives, and even less idea of what bardic is
decides to go home and leave this particular activety for the birds.

I apologize for the length of this, and most of the above is true ( more or
less) and has happened, either too me (a thoughly scary time) or I have seen 
happen. A great deal of attention must be paid to the care and feeding of
newbies, a hospitaller is perhaps the most important office in the group, and
great care should be taken to see that the person who fills that office is not
only capable of being helpful but actively trying to be helpful.

Message-Id: <11120@s.ms.uky.edu>

I've had fun before but......


Gentles, 
  Here follows an account of a novice fighters first mele and first meeting
with Palimar, the crown prince.  
  This was at Candlemas, an event in the Barony of the Flame in Kentucky.  
The society rented out an old building downtown and had a room upstairs for
the mele/tourney.  Anyway, we started out with about eight men on each side.
This was my first mele, being that I've only been authorized for about 1 year
and have been fighting on and off.  
  Ok, the sides squared off and we went at each other.  The crown prince was
wielding a spear and his halaberd.  The other side consisted of about 3 
spearmen, 3 sword and sheild and 3 other various weapons.  The battle was
going along fine until I and two others with sword and shield were cornered
by the crown prince and two other spearmen.  Things looked grim until I heared
a small voice in the back of my head reminded me, "When being attacked with
a spear, get inside his reach!"  So, I figured, what the heck and gave a good
yell and went right at the crown prince.  The effect was great.  His eyes got
about 3 inches in diamater when I closed, but the other two spearmen got 
REAL interested in me, putting me off the prince.  He then pulled out his
halabered.  I knew I was in trouble.  As that thought was running through
my head, I saw a spear come under my shield and dodged.....too late.  A
clean killing blow hit me as I felt this WHOOOOMP go against my helm.  It 
seems the crown prince got off a blow and connected in the short time it
took for me to change my field of vision.  I heared the crowd go "Oooh" as
I went "Arrrgh!"  Needles to say....I was very dead.  
  Later on the crown prince came over to apologise for the blow.  He said
he couldn't have stopped it.  I was very gracious (how else to a crown 
prince?) and told him it was no problem.  Actually I was glad that me and him
didn't square off....HE'D HAVE CREAMED ME.  He laughed.  What a great person
for crown prince.  But the blow was worth the look on his face when I came
charging at him.  The hearald watching said it was a very gutsy move....


  Oh yeah.....would anyone out there know of a place that I can send off for
period Alto Recorder music?  (about 12th cen.?)  please send E-Mail to the

Subject: Households & pagans
Message-ID: <890223023451.18.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

Thanks to milord Justin for the ideas concerning non-clique types of
households. I realize that households *can* be very good, particularly
in SCA local groups which have a large percentage of halfbees (people
who come to events but never get *seriously* involved). In such an 
environment, households can be a source of community and stability.
As always, very much depends on the individuals in the household.

My previous posting was not intended as a condemnation of the house-
hold system, only as a query about their usefulness. In Sweden the
SCA groups tend to be pretty well held together (very few halfbees)
so the need for households here has been small. Our local group here
at Uppsala has made a serious effort to break up the tendency to
grab the best seats at events. We simply mark out a place for every
person, randomly mixed. Only known couples are seated together. This
means that we have to provide the feastgear for everyone since house-
hold feastgear cannot easily be divided up. But it works very well.

On Paganism:

Milady Shava, I read your posting with great interest. I think you
are right that Christianity and Paganism are mixed throughout western
history. One might say that this is one of the great good things about
medieval Christianity: It had a terriffic ability to absorbe and use
native ideas among the pagans that were converted.

This is not to say that the Church has allowed pagan beliefs which are
openly contrary to Christian doctrine. But efforts are always made to
find out if there are patterns of thought among the pagans, which can
be used to make them understand Christ. One example is the savior figure
of Balder in Norse mythology, which has resemblances to the second coming
of Christ. 

Various kinds of popular superstitions have always existed as an undercurrent
in every Christian society. Church policy has been to fight this with
words and ideas, not with fire and sword. Violence has been used when
heresies have challenged central teachings of the Church from within.
I don't believe that the people who had pagan traditions perceived them-
selves as being pagans. They were good Christians, but of course they
used cures and little household magicks that they had inherited from
their forefathers. The priests might not like it, but the common people
saw no conflict between these traditions and Christian doctrine.
Remember, the church teachers had very few means of disseminating know-
ledge to the general populace. 

As to the SCA, I believe that Catholic Christianity must be recognized
as the official religion of the medieval world most of us are trying
to depict in our personas. This means that any open display of paganism
that would have been offensive in the middle ages should not be per-
formed in the SCA either.

But then, almost *any* display of *any* religion is banned anyway, so
what's the issue?

Yours,

William de Corbie

     I quite agree, except for one point, and that's more a matter of
interpretation than anything else, anyway.  The thing is, in most cases,
people who form cliques end up with incredibly TINY amounts of real power
to accomplish ANYTHING.  The only "power" that they get is the power to
harm a group, to insult the other members, to prevent anything useful from
being done, and to act in all ways like a bull in a china shop, destroying
good things which they neither understand nor care about.  The idea that
cliques give their members power is a popular delusion.
     As an example, consider the clique called the Bolsheviks.  They needed
"power" to work for justice, economic reform, and so on, and they ended up
causing something on the order of fifty million murders/executions and
destroying the Soviet Union's chance of developing a healthy economy for
a period of at least nearly a century, and it may not yet be anywhere near
over with, either.  What kind of power is that?
     The moral seems to be that the way to have the power to DO things, as
opposed to the (non)power of being able to undo things, is to work for the
good of others without expecting anything in return, and to try not to
increase your "power" at the expense of others, even including others who
ARE trying to become too "powerful" - if "power" has to be taken away from
someone, it should be shared as fairly as possible, and not just claimed by
someone else.

Subject:  bare blades/housholds

(Let's try this again)

        Unto all and sundry doth Richard DeLacy send his greetings

    About bare blades my feeling is a little biased.  I have been studying
stage combat with one of the 9 American Fight Masters for a number of years
now and I think staged violence is the neatest thing since pre-sliced bananas.
When I first saw a Prince force a King off his throne by force of arms I
thought that was kind of neat - although I wouldn't want to see it every time -
there is something classy about having the Kingdom given to you rather than
just taking it.  Of course there was no actual fight, (Awww!) but merely a lot
of live steel being dealt with in (my considered and informed opinion) a safe
and 'professional', as well as sufficiently theatrical, way.

        If a fight were actually to be done (or an 'assassination') that
might be a different matter depending on who choreographed it - Again a safe
professional job would be great.  Anyone who has done any work of this kind
knows that there are certain techniques that make it safe and interesting
at the same time.  In Carolingia a year or two ago Geoffrey Mathias (a very
skilled stage combattant) choreographed a fight between himself and The Sir
Michael of York (finally ended with the choreographed intervention of
Master Kobayashi Yutaka) that thrilled the assembled crowd and the Baron.  The
fight was done with live steel rapiers (Schlager Blades I think - 3 ft long
3/4 in wide at the forte, narrowing at the foible).


On Housholds:  I noted an interesting thing in this argument:  All the against
household arguments were 'households are bad - they alienate people' without
any specific examples either of events or specific households.  Meanwhile
most of the pro-household arguments are either 'my household does these good
things' or even better 'I'm not in a household but the ones I am familiar
with have done these specific good things'.

        In my time I have heard many bad things about housholds but what I have
seen is House Windsmeet running an event, House Windy Hill making sure that
people were at demos (not necessarily from their houshold, just somebody for
new people to talk to about the SCA in general), Feral's House (is it Silver
Dragon?) running a weekly fighting practice that anyone could come to.  All
these are specific and important good things that housholds do here in the
North (according to the US, of course we're central to the EK).  The only
substantiated thing that I have ever seen that _might_ be bad is that these
Households tend to sit together at feasts.  However House windsmeet has been
sitting together at feasts for about two years now and were only just now made
into a household.


                In service to Coronet and Crown,

                                        Richard DeLacy, Guardsman of Carolingia

    Subject: Fencer/Archer Order
    I am posting this message for Lord Kristen von der Hadnfalke.
    ================================================================

    As a fencer and an archer and not a rattan fighter, I've been following
    the discussion of knighthood for folk like us with great interest.  One
    reason I GAFIAed ten years ago was the Caerthe then cared little for
    the arts, which I was also interested in, but gave great honor only to
    rattan fighters....

    The solution for us then would be to create a separate parallel order
    for archers, scouts, and fencers, perhaps with the title Master of
    Arms.  This way we give and get honor for our battle skills, and
    demonstrate Period recognition for those people.  A Squire could then
    be elevated to MAA (Man at Arms) and after a period as a MAA decide
    whether he wanted to continue rattan training to become a Knight, or
    branch off and become an archer/fencer etc.....

There is an obvious technical problem with Lord Kristen's suggestion: the
title "Master -at- Arms" is already reserved for those members of the
Chivalry who choose not to swear fealty to the Crown, so i expect the title
"Master -of- Arms" would be considered too similar to that to be allowed.

as to "Man at Arms", someone else has mentioned how that term is used in
Calontir. more locally to me, i have heard it applied as an informal title
for a newcomer/non-armiger who claims to be the retainer of a more
experinced member/armiger (who is not of the chivalry). in Carolingia,
"equerry" and "demoiselle" tend to be the titles applied to gentles who
take such service, but "man at arms" has been used as well.

of course, these are technical quibbles rather than an argument per se with
Lord Kristen's intent. that, i have worries about on the grounds of award
proliferation. which rubs against the problem that military arts other than
rattan fighting do not have a peerage award (whether or not one believes
they should, there are enough people who do feel so that it is a legitimate
topic of discussion), but don't seem to fit into the arts or service
peerages (again, a legit topic of discussion regardless of one's opinion).
i neither fight, fence, shoot, nor scout, so i don't feel i have a
sufficiently grounded opinion to voice any. yet.

    ...Established archers/fencers could unite themselves with a knight to
    form what was in period called a "lance" - a knight, his squire,
    sargeant of arms and assorted retainers.  This opens the way for some
    interesting war-type team competitions between lances from the various
    kingdoms.

this concept would be interesting, at least in demonstration; the marshalls
would have to be very careful about formulating the rules so as to allow
the lighter-armored/armed folk to participate sufficiently without being in
danger from the more heavily-armored/armed.

in closing, i offer my sincere sympathy to Lord Kristen that he found
Caerthe so little appreciative of the arts, and would assure him that it is
not everywhere so. many groups do hold the arts in great honor; perhaps
in his newer home of Lac Salan, or some other relatively nearby group
(i realize that out west in the wide open spaces, "nearby" may indeed
be relative), he can find more kindred souls.

I have one--very basic--question about this---  WHERE THE HELL IS YOUR
EARL MARSHALL?  I believe that if *anyone* tried such stunts in court in the
West, they would be lucky to be tolerated in the Society again.  This is
*very* bad form.  These people shouldb e reminded that the rules of the
lists forbind live steel (even sheathed) on the Field for excellent reasons,
and that area is well supervised.

(No that I'm down off my soap box . . .)

What you described greatly frightens me.  I have participated in "live
steel" demos.  This was done in public, after expanaitions about what we
were doing, that we don't do it in Society combat, and that we would be
moving very slowly.  All the while we had Marshalls all around it.  We
moved at a bout 1/4 to 1/3 normal speed.  Only fighters selected for
calm disposition, even disposition, and excellent control were asked to
do these demos.  Then we sweated . . .

I would *hope* that anyone doing this in an uncontrolled manner would
be given a tongue lahing he'll not *ever* forget.  Were I there--I'd 
be the first to cry "hold!"  If the participants didn't stop IMMEDIATELY,
I believe that they should be expelled from the Society.  We have one
of the safest sprots in the world--even high school basketball players
get killed occasionally--and we need to keep it that way.  Neither of
the major accidents in the West that I have had the misfortune to know
about involved Society combat--and both of those were errors in judgement.

I wholeheartedly concur with these sentiments.  I can think of only two
significant exceptions.  The first is that it should be permitted is the
*very*careful* exercises to get the feel of the motion of a real weapon. 
This can be done in an open and reasonably isolated area with competent
observers to protect the unwary and should be done at low speed.  The second
exception is activities that could--collectively--be called 'pagentry.'
By this I mean things like arches of swords (which, by-the-bye, are very
nice--and traditional--at weddings).  Such things do note involve weapons
moving either fast or out of sight of the wielder.  For example--in the West,
a new King draws the Great Sword of State when it is presented to him as
part of the Coronation ceremony.  Likewise--Knighting are conducted with
a bare blade.

>How do you react to a child threatening a playmate with a dagger and, when
>disciplined, responds with "The King does it"!?

With either or both of two replies:  *You* are not the King. or The Earl
Marshall does *not*.  (One can also point out that the Earl Marshall has
the authority to tell the King not to.)

>At one Coronation, we even had retainers with bare blades bouncing through
>the assembled crowd, over chairs and around people.  Someone could have
>very easily gotten hurt.

This is very distressing news.  This *should*not* happen.  The only result
will be to enrich the Guild of Lawyers.

>Does anyone else out there have problems with this or is this just my own

I have a lot of problems with it.  It does not impress me when someone waves
*any* weapon around without considering his surroundings--whether steel or
rattan.  I cannot urge you too strongly to take this up with your Kingdom
Earl Marshall and Seneschal.  If they don't see why this is a problem--it
will probably wind up with the BoD--who should not have to intervene in
such a case of arrant stupidity.

>Again, this is just my opinion and I would be interested in hearing any

I fervently hope there is only one side to this--and that the perpetrators
will realize it before they get us *all* in hot water.

Subject: firearms

Michal Litchfield has written a considered essay which poses a dillema- the 
undisputed existance of fire arms in period vs. a very powerfull gut feeling 
that they don't belong in the sca. ( What follows, on the other hand, is an 
attack to which you may with good reason take exception.)

Neither he nor i claims that persons using guns are lacking in either courage 
or personal honor. (anyone seen "the magnificent 7"? great flick).  Courage 
and honor are found in every society i've ever read about.  Chivalry, on the 
other hand, is a much more specific and elusive concept.  And in period, the
gun was generaly considered to have no part in chivalry. (the writer of 
'orlando furioso' flamed at length about it).

My own opinion of guns is simple:  i don't like them, i don't want them 
arround.  I think they belong in the category of things that existed in the 
middle ages that should not be recreated, along with violent religious 
intolerance and persecution, the rigid definition of what a persons role in 
society was according to who his parents were,  lack of proper sanitation with 
resultant plagues,  slavery, rape, (any one here read 'Tirant lo Blanc'?), 
virtual absence of self-determination for women, absence of reliable birth 
controll, etc, etc.

o.k., we get poor sanitation and plagues.  There are reports of rapes.  There 
is the occasional person who thinks acting as a slave for a while is fun.  And 
there are people with hand guns and muskets.   This last group justifies 
itself in the name of authenticity. Maybe (maybe) if someone said to me, "I 
have this wheel-lock pistol back at my camp," i would think, "oh, neat!" 
(actually that would be neat, like someone building his own watch), but seeing 
people walking around with them, seeing people walking around with chains 
around thier necks, or seeing people fry flies into hamburgers, i am simply 
appalled.

I do NOT NOT NOT advocate banning guns.  I do not advocate banning slave or 
any other offensive persona.  I merely ask that if you do have a gun, you not 
wear it in public out side of your own barony or your own encampment.  And not 
there if there are other people's children around.

Subject: random thoughts on persona

Unto milord Nightshade, greeting!

When the sca was formed, Tolkien and Faerie were just about the only 'fantasy' 
worlds we had.  Since then fantasy has come out of the closet, but those two 
remain the strongest ones that are also medievaliod.  Other fantasy personae 
you may encounter are the barbarians and the darkoverians. Some people have 
chosen pernish names, perhaps some of these keep firelizards--i havnt met any 
myself.
A number of things go into what you are in the sca.  Ther's your name, of 
course.  Some names are strongly tied to their culture.  For instance, when 
Samual ben Isaac decided to be random welsh rather than kazzar, he changed his 
name.  On the otherhand, when Cariadoc of the Bow decided to be moslem rather 
than welsh, he didn't.  As long as you don't choose an obviously other-fantasy 
name, e.g. "Kthulusdottir", choosing a name that fits a fantacy person should 
cause no problems, except possibly with the college of arms, and you can ignor 
them until you want to submit a device.(and if your not sufficiently into 
period to want a period type persona, you probably don't want a device for a 
while anyway).
	Then there's your garb.  This is what most people are going to see of 
you.  If youre source world is sufficiently medievaloid to pass with out 
comment in the medieval world, again no problem.  In fact you may find some 
study of the corresponding period garb to be helpfull, fun, and more 
comfortable and practical for sca activities than anything you see on a book 
cover.  If your source world's garb would not pass in a period society, may i 
reccommend going undercover--the previous sentence still applies.   If you are 
not willing to wear either the garb of sca period or of the (well established) 
"barbarian" groups, i suggest that the sca may not be the group you need to be 
in right now.
	There's what you do in the sca.  This is what the people who know you 
and the people who hear about you see.  This is how you make a name and a 
position for your self in our society.  This may include fighting or the arts. 
 It may involve lowly but vital things like gate-keeping or scullery work.  It 
definetly involves the way you act towards other people which should (of 
course) be with friendly courtesy, but the degree and style of address are up 
to you.
	And lastly there is your persona.  This will influence (but not 
dictate) your choice of garb.  It may influence (but not dictate) your choice 
of activities.  You may use it to shape the style with which you adress the 
people around it.  You may charm it with smiles and with soap (oops, wrong 
essay). Your persona is ultimately your personal affair.  How much of it you 
make other peoples affair is purely up to you.  If you use it as an excuse to 
use otherwise unacceptable clothing, equipemtn,or behavior, people are likely 
to point out that your clothing, equipment, or behavior is out of line,  but 
they cant touch your persona.

A recent missive mentioned "Saint Nick" as connected with paganism. While I
have not verified the matter with authoritative sources, my understanding is
that he was a real person, a bishop in the sixth (?) century in the area now
known as Poland (?). Further, the red and white in his clothing comes from
traditional vestments, and candy canes represent his bishop's crook or
staff, a symbol of his leadership of the flock. The red and white in the
candy canes are also symbolic, of Jesus' blood (red) and purity (white). I
do agree with the general point that was being made, however (that Christian
churches adapted and absorbed a number of pagan practices).

In SCA Digest #253, Roderic of Basing wrote in defense of period firearms.

A most enjoyable posting, milord, and I do agree with you in principle: how
can one be a musketeer without a musket?  Unfortunately, the Corpora's ban on
firearms, real or fake, has nothing to do with the Society's conception of
whether they were period or not.  The problem is with the mundane authorities:
period firearms are GUNS, and police everywhere are liable to froth at the
mouth at the merest thought of a bunch of crazy people running around with GUNS.

Responsibility has nothing to do with it.  Authenticity has nothing to do with
it.  Even whether or not the guns actually work has nothing to do with it (a
lot of robberies and assault cases have involved water pistols, believe it or
not).  It's just that GUNS is a terribly hot word in the world these days, and
if we started carrying period firearms -- even without ammunition, even if
they don't even function -- we're likely to get shut down faster than you can
say "Bang."

Sad but true; I'm afraid that this is yet another mundane interference in our
universe, right up there with the tax police and the insurance thugs.

Subject: The Church - an unsolvable problem?
Message-ID: <890223163525.41.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

Gentles of the ethereal net, greetings.

From around 800 to 1200, the Christian Church flowered in Europe. Beautiful
cathedrals and monasteries were built everywhere. New orders of monks, nuns
and friars were founded. Religious fervor contributed to crusades and pilgrim-
ages. Knights were dubbed in churches and had relics in the hilts of their
swords. In fact, the Middle Ages without the Roman Catholic Church would be
like the 20th century without electricity: totally impossible.

Still, the Church is very much absent in out Current Middle Ages. This is sad,
even though there are may good reasons for restraining religious activities at
SCA events. Here is a summary.

REASONS FOR RESTRAINT
---------------------
1. Christianity is still very much alive, and many of us believe in it. While
we can fake a secular ceremony like a coronation or a knighting, and perform
them theatrically - as part of the game we play - we can't do that with reli-
gious services. We can't celebrate mass as a re-enactment. It would be sacri-
lege to do such things without actually praying and believing in the rites.
We cannot separate SCA activities from mundane reality in the case of Christi-
anity or any other religion that people today believe in.

2. Religion is serious business since most of us have one. Being exposed to
religious propaganda from those of another creed is distasteful to us, and
real clashes between opposing ideologies are a risk if religious ceremonies 
are allowed.A Christian will look with distaste on witchcraft, and an atheist
may abhor the idea of being exposed to any form of religious activity.

3. Today, the world is riddled with religious sects, particularly in America.
There are hundreds of more-or-less weird cults. Parents are worried about 
their children and don't want them involved with "Moonies" or "Children of
God" etcetera. We certainly don't want to give anyone the least cause to
suspect that the SCA is a sect or cult of any sort. This will frighten
people away.

4. Church offices were a hierarchy of power in the Middle Ages. Thus, having
a persona who is a bishop would imply a very high status. Where secular titles
are concerned, the SCA has strict control. Honor has to be merited. It would 
not be appropriate to let people assume ecclesiastical titles as they saw
fit. But what should an SCA member do in order to become a bishop? Could it
be an alternative title for counts? No. Laurels? No. Church hierarchy can't
simply be used as a merit system similar to the secular titles.

IS THERE A WAY?
---------------
Our version of the Middle Ages is crippled without the Church. It would be very
nice if there was some way to depict also this part of medieval life. Here are
some suggestions for your consideration:

1. Wearing religious garb need not offend anybody. A monk or a nun can be a 
good temporary identity for somebody who is new to the Society and hasn't 
decided on his or her persona yet. Let your Gold Key get some monkish robes!
We had a guy in my Canton who dressed as a Fransiscan and called himself
"Friar Incertus" (Brother Uncertain) for a couple of months before he decided
who he really wanted to be. He was very anonymous in his grey hooded habit, so
the name didn't stick. And nobody was offended when he went around making
the sign of the cross and mumbling "Pax vobiscum" every now and then.

2. The SCA does have an ideology and certain values. It is not neutral in
moral issues. It actively encourages members to cultivare certain medieval
virtues. A person appearing as a "preaching monk" (or other religious official)
who does not speak of *religious* matters but only of the SCA ideals, would be
OK in my opinion. You could even form a brotherhood/sisterhood of monks/nuns,
with the avowed task of preaching courtesy & chivalry, and/or helping to 
instruct newbies about forsoothly behavior.

3. Religion can't be part of official SCA rituals. But if an SCA member is
ordained in a Christian denomination, I see no reason not to allow the
celebration of a medieval mass at an event, as long as it is done in a
separate area where non-christians aren't compelled to go.

4. Of course, if we allow Christian rites, we may face demands for pagan
ceremonies as well. And why not? As long as they are out of view and hearing,
the Vikings could have a "blot". On the other hand, since nobody seriously
believes in Thor, a Viking "blot" would be a re-enactment, not a real religious
service. As a non-religious re-enactment, it is simply a learning activity in
which even I, as a Christian, could take part.

5. Religious personas can appear as part of theatrical "happenings" at an
event. Such happenings are a good way to boost the feeling of authenticity.
Just as you could have two knights theatrically argue over the beauty of
a lady, issuing bold challenges or whatever, you could dress someone up
as a bishop and have him appear during dinner to preach a crusade or some-
thing. Or you could have a theological argument between a university pro-
fessor and a cardinal (could be very amusing). I cannot see how this could
offend anybody's religious beliefs, if it is done with tact.

Please excuse the horrendous length of this posting.

Yes! Rise up against your feudal masters! Band together the disaffected
rich and the rising middle class to sway the peasents with false promises
of a better life. Now is the time that you, yes YOU, can carve a higher
niche in your society. :-)

Actually, why not send it up the line to the historians, and send a note
explaining the situation to the others? Copies would be accessable
through the historians, an if the really wanted a copy, they could do
it on their own nickle. Otherwise, start your own underground newspaper.
Forment dissent and rebellion before your social betters come and ...
oops, revolutionary jargon is too addictive.

Subject: re: Households - what good are they?

To the gentles to whom these missives flow, let me add my gentle
support for the words of my lady Catrin o'r Rhyd For and those of
milord Justin De Coeur - Households are nice things, and usually
recognize already established relationships which have already formed
for common interests, friendships and whateverelse.

However, households, once created, do need to be careful how they do
things, because they can create an image which may or may not be
warranted.  Just like any particular group of friends, a household's
specific definition of who they are and their attitudes towards others
can clearly make them "not nice" (choose your own version of "not nice" :-).

They main thing I get out of a household is a firm bond of friendship
with people I like.  Others get pride out of being associated with a
large and powerful (influential) group of people.  Others like to use
it as a method of excluding others.  Any club can be good or bad,
just depends on how the specific members behave.

House Chat Gris is a really nice group of people who I am glad to call
life-long friends.  I've been with them since my second year in the SCA
(around AS VIII), and I still find them interesting and really genuine,
caring people.  Even moreso, I believe that all those that meet them
and spend time with them find them so...  Thus honor is brought upon all
of us in this household.

To m'lord Wm de Corbie - trust me, households can be very wonderful
things - perhaps your luck with them has been poor so far.  May you
have better experiences in the future.

Friends,

In case you are interested in the major example of Christian holidays
being made out of Pagan festivals, complete with traditions, I
recommend an article in Green Egg, Issue #83 (I can't remember the
sabbath title for it, *damn* this leaky brain!)  It goes into the
background of most of the traditions used at Christmas, including
the Yule Log, the Virgin birth (what? it's not original with Christ?!
nope.), the wise men, the date it falls around, the tree, caroling, etc.

Very interesting stuff.  If you need the address of the Church of All
Worlds (they put our Green Egg), email me, and I'll send it to you...
I'd put it in now, but I don't have it with me...don't be too
impatient, though, 'cause I leave today for a 10-day pilgrimage to
the Holy Roman Ruins (Rome, itself!), and won't be accessing a terminal

Subject: Timeline

To the good folk of the Rialto --

    If you aren't already watching the new television series "Timeline",
check it out. In a Nightline-style format, it presents famous events in
history as if they were currently-happenning news events.

    For example, the first episode presented the Fall of the First (? my
history of that period is weak) Crusade, as Saladin comes in and takes
Jerusalem. The format is directly stolen from the nightly news, with an
anchor, on-the-spot commentators, and feature reporters (presenting, for
instance, tapes of the Pope's original call for the Crusade).

    The production values are marvelous -- it really makes you feel like
it was happenning right now. The show takes itself just seriously enough
to strive for authenticity (the first episode alone must have involved
enough garb to clothe half the people of the Knowne World), but does crack
a quiet smile at times -- the format includes advertisements for current
innovations (like chimneys).

    It's the best presentation of history I've seen to date -- it has the
same sort of spark that the Society does; history is simply more fun if
you live it. Highly recommended -- it should be showing on most major PBS
stations, and is well worth the half-hour...

ordered all the belted fighters to one side of the field.  Then any un-belted
nobles (it happens.)  That still didn't divide the fighters into two even
groups, so they went through the remaining fighters picking out fighters of
note and sending them to the far side of the field (remeniscent of one
of the Western Kingdom's "Knight-for-a-day" system in Crown.)  This finally
evened things up.  At that point the people on the 'novice' side of the field
were told to walk over and challenge one of the others.  This ensured that the

were liberal about weapon styles that some of the novices won.  And the final

Subject: East Kingdom - Western Region Principality Poll
Message-Id: <2320@canisius.UUCP>

To all citizens of the East Kingdom's Western Region and South-Western Region
greetings from Dagonell the Juggler.

The OFFICIAL polling letter has been sent out.  The Western Region Seneschal,
Syr Andreas Hak, and his squires and all of their respective ladies had a 
"lick it and stick it" meeting at his house on February 14.  The 500+ polling
letters were then sent off to the East Kingdom Seneschal, Countess Aiden, the
following morning.  Aiden will put on the individual mailing labels of ALL of
the members of the SCA in the Western Region (new borders) plus Eire PA, 
Pittsburgh PA, and all of WV, and then mail them out.  ALL responses MUST be in
her hands before she leaves for Ice Dragon (an ungodly huge regional event!)
She will be leaving Friday, February 17.  The votes will be tallied at Ice
Dragon and announced at Royal Court (as if it wasn't long enough already?? ;-) )

OFFICIAL RUMOR DESTRUCTION
There have been rumors going around that the mailing labels for the poll would
be taken off the Pikestaff (EK newsletter) mailing list and if you didn't get
Pikestaff you wouldn't get a ballot.  WRONG! WRONG! WRONG! WRONG!
ALL OFFICIAL MEMBERS of the SCA at ANY membership level WILL receive a ballot.
If you don't receive Pikestaff on your sustaining membership because your
significant other does, you WILL still get a ballot.  If you don't receive
Pikestaff because you're only an associate member, you WILL still get a ballot.
(If your dog/cat/pet rock/infant child/etc. has a family membership THEY
will get a ballot, however the poll states that only individuals who are 14
years or older will be counted in the tally.) 

WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO :
What you will receive will be a sheet of paper wrapped around a pre-addressed
stamped envelope and stapled to it.  The sheet of paper is your polling letter.
Remove the staples.  The bottom third will have the stamp and address label
that got it to you.  The top two thirds is for your vote.  The question reads
(This is from memory, so don't hold me to it!) : Do you wish to be in a princi-
pality formed from the area being polled or any viable subset of it?
There will be answer boxes below for yes, no and abstain.  The question is
phrased the way it is to allow for a principality being formed from a smaller
group of positive responses.  For example, if everybody in the eastern half
of the polling area says no, and everybody in the western half of the polling
area says yes, then the western half will become its own little principality.
If you have any questions, Syr Hak's phone number is included at the bottom.
Check the appropriate box and turn your ballot over.  On the back, is a 
list of the final choices for the principality name and device (the device
will be listed both pictorially and verbally, [ that's emblazon and blazon to
you heraldic types. ;-) ] )  If you have a strong preference for a particular
name or device, circle it.  If you find one unacceptable, cross it out.  If
you don't do anything, it will be assumed that either choice is acceptable
and you have no preference.  When you have filled out your ballot, place it
in the pre-stamped, pre-addressed (to Aiden) envelope, and seal it.  Mail it
as quickly as possible!!  The post-useless has a little over four weeks to get
the ballots from Hak to Aiden, Aiden to you, and you back to Aiden, which is
pushing it.

IF YOU DO NOT RECEIVE A BALLOT, AND YOU THINK YOU SHOULD:
Photocopy someone else's.  There is a space on the ballot that says "Place
proof of membership here if photocopying."  Proof of membership is your
membership card, Pikestaff mailing label, or a letter from Griselda the
Patient.  Mail it in to Aiden.

AT ICE DRAGON
The votes will be tallied (presumeably they will keep track of local group
somehow so that subset possibility will be possible.)  All the yeses will
be totalled, all the noes will be totaled, all the abstains will be totalled.
ANY POLLING LETTERS WHICH ARE NOT RECEIVED WILL BE COUNTED AS A "NO" VOTE,
NOT AS AN "ABSTAIN"!!!!!!!!  After all three sets have been counted, the
abstains will be lumped in with which ever group is larger, the yeses or 
the noes.  If the yeses then total a majority (>50%) then a principality
bid will be granted.  The results of the heraldry polling will be announced
much later as only the votes that came from within the borders of the new
principality will be counted.  

If you have any questions, If you don't get your official letter soon,
call Syr Andreas Hak, SOON!

Message-Id: <Feb.23.16.23.31.1989.1259@vanhalen.rutgers.edu>

Good gentles,

I have read this week's discussion of households with great interest,
and have generally agreed with the sentiments expressed by Lady
Catrin, Lord Justin, and Sir Michael.  I would like to add one point.

A household, like a guild or any other structure in the Society, is a
feudal framework for activity.  If one believes, as I do, that the
feudal bond between lord and vassal lies at the heart of the SCA, then
a household is one more way to properly express this concept.
Households often give new members an entry into SCA society, by
allowing them quick and easy access to long-time members.  They may
thus learn the values and traditions of our Society that much more
quickly and more easily.  Households provide a congenial environment
for the formation of other feudal bonds: apprenticeship and the like.
They provide a framework for informal appreticeship as well, since a
new member may find his own interests share by those around him, and
so share with them.  Like any organization, households can be abused,
but that, I think, is a flaw in the individuals involved, not in the
structure itself.

Respectfully,

	Arval.

	That *is* a good question.  I definately fall into the group holding
to a relation to the medieval knight over the reward for Chivalry and Skill
at Arms.  But...  How are we to note an individual's relationship to that
ideal??  The only standards we have are their chivalrous behavior and their
skill at arms... (and other commitment to the Society.)  So how do we tell
that we are keeping it in relation to knighthood?  There is only one way that
comes to mind... excluding those who do not fight heavy.

	Basically, if we open the Chivalry up to fencers and archers, we are,
as Eke notes, making it an award, and disassociating it with medieval 
knighthood.  *This* is why I don't like the idea of Knighthood for fencers.

)William de Corbie

	Well, I can think of a couple.  They provide units at wars that look 
nice (same device on shields, livery, etc.) as well as groups used to 
working together.  (and this goes beyond fighting, a household can allow
individuals to pool resources and information on a topic, that they can then
share out to people in the chapter.  The closeknit nature of a household
makes this easier.)
	Households also provide fighters with simular strengths and weaknesses,
to the amusement of outsiders... :-)

     I know of one significant exception, of which I believe you have some
knowledge.  I speak of the Great Household of the Dark Horde, which is not
at all feudal.

     Of course, it could be fairly argued that your point refers only to 
*households*, and not *Great Households*, which are quite seperate 
entities within the Society.

     Greetings fellow Gentlefolk,

     What is the latest consensus regarding the posting of upcoming events
to the Rialto?  Event announcements generally need several months lead-time
to make it into kingdom newsletters, so usually appear no more than 2 months
before the event date (unless the event is an annual one).  It would be nice
to be able to announce planned events 3 or 4 months in advance, to allow for
more schedule-shifting and vacation-planning.  If not for certain problems,
the Rialto would seem ideal for this.
     I will be autocrating a Celtic event (Celtic Clan War and Cattle Raid
Beltaine Bash) in late April, and would like to get the information to any-
one who might be interested.  However, I have no desire to bother everybody
in California with this information (event site is in Pennsylvania).  There   
is, unfortunately, no "midwest to eastern seaboard" distribution: available.

     I've obtained the best results from the theatrical tatoo dyes, but, as
you note, they take a lot of patience and a steady hand, especially on parts
of the body partially covered with hair (like arms, legs, etc).
     I get my dyes from a friend who gets them from California, and they are
very expensive by the bottle.  If you get any responses about buying in
quantity, please forward me a copy.

     I found, then lost again, and have just re-found, a possible connection
for English Woad seeds.  If I manage to get some, I'll let you know.  If 
anyone here knows a reliable source, please write to me.  English Woad (not
the domestic variety) makes a wonderful dye for textiles, as well.
It pays to take care when using English Woad dyes, though, since it is both
a contact anasthetic and a hallucinogen (somebody told me PCP-analogue, can
anybody verify this?).  Note that the hallucinogenic effects are supposed to
be significant only when applied to the skin in very large amounts (such as
a whole-body paint job), since it is only mildy transportable through the
skin.  Thus, support for the "Pictish berzerker mythos". . .warriors who
were not only immune to the pain of wounding but also hallucinating on the
battlefield.  Not an opponent I would want to face.

     Does half count (on the Mother's side, captured by the Britons of
Strathclyde)?  You can take the woad off of the Pict, but you can't. . .etc.

Quibble again. According to my memory of the sagas, Iceland was officially
converted in 996. I will agree that it wasn't 100% by pointing at another
example.

St. Patrick converted Ireland in the fifth century. However, the vikings
and the irish tales report druids at the battle of Clontarf (the vikings
called it the battle of Dublin), 600 years later.

Visible religion is the one area where the SCA fails to recreate the
atmosphere of medieval times. The church was a significant power and deeply
affected many parts of daily life. I can't claim to miss something that

It is nice to go about without fear of persecution and without the
necessity for hypocracy. On the other hand it another factor which makes it
next to impossible to live a persona at an event.

  You are absolutely right MiLord - what's more, I seem to recall a

in December, but September!  The Catholic Church, in it's attempt to
discredit paganism and "convert the masses", Moved the bithdate to 
coincide with Yuletide, one of the biggest Pagan festivals of the 
year.  Try explaining what the following has to do with JC's birth:
Yule log, Christmas Tree, "Christmas cookies and candies", caroling.
(need I go on? :-) Yep, you guessed it, all Pagan Tradition.  For that

Message-ID: <890223013741.18.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

Greetings!

Most branches of the SCA have newsletters (at least over here). 
As the chronicler of the Canton of Aros, I have been publishing
"Aros Tidender", a 12-page newsletter produced with a xerox
machine. This newsletter has 20 paying subscribers.

But apart from the 20 paid copies, I am also required to send
courtesy copies to:

-King and Queen
-Kingdom Seneschal
-Kingdom Chronicler
-Principality Chronicler
-Prince and Princess
-Heirs to the Coronet
-Principality Seneschal
-Principality Historian

Also, it would be considered disourteous not to send copies to:

-Baron
-Barony chronicler
-Barony seneschal
-Heirs (Kingdom)

All in all, this makes *at least* 12 courtesy copies, or more than one
third of the total number of copies. I hardly need to point out that
this is a very hard strain on my resources, and ups the production
cost of the newsletter considerably.

The problem with courtesy copies is that the system strikes hardest
against the weakest. Those at the bottom of the feudal pyramid must
send copies to all the levels above (barony, principality, kingdom)
while I guess the kingdom chronicler doesn't need to send copies to
anyone except King & Queen and a couple of officers. (I am not sure
of this, correct me if I'm wrong.)

Even if the kingdom Chronicler would have to send out 15 copies, it
would be no big deal for a publication with several hundred subscribers.
But down at the bottom, it hits hard. Subscription prices go up to the
level where the members can't afford to have the newsletter. It's a clear
case of *feudal oppression*! 

Chroniclers everywhere! Let us rise in rebellion! Let us smash the
unfair system whereby the self-perpetuating autocracy oppresses the
working classes! Live la jaquerie de les scribbleurs! Vive la revolution! :-)

But seriously, what can be done about this? Is it *necessary* for all
the people above to get free copies? Wouldn't it make more sense to
send the newsletters to the superior chroniclers only? 

Yours in the treadmill

Just a minor quibble here.  Iceland was officially 'converted' a bit later
that this, but it took quite a bit longer for the conversion to be complete.
There are documented examples of the older religion hanging around until into
the fourteenth century and little things like Thor's hammers on one side of the
grave marker, crossed on the other much later.  Up front out and out paganism
did go underground within a few centuries of the eleventh, though.

Various and sundry have forgotten one important, Period, present-in-Western-
Europe, non-Christian minority: the Jews.  Not all of them were in the ghettoes.
Neither were they all persecuted.  Charlemagne authorized a Jewish principality
in central France which survived for quite a while.  The Khazars also squeak in
under the time limit.  In fact there was quite a number of Jewish nobles (even
some knights, though the traditional vows had to be modified).  For those
people who want their personas to travel a Jew makes a lot of sense.  An 
inordinate share of the sea captains and navigators of the time were such.

You could also try a Romany persona, but only if you're _heavily_ into
persecution....

     It was first published in hardcover by Farrar, Straus, & Giroux in

Subject: Book on King Arthur

Greetings to all gentles from Aell Aethelwita, called Ellethel:

While I have not had the pleasure of encountering Steinbeck's book (yet), I
have recently had the distinct pleasure of reading a book on the historical
King Arthur. The title is (you guessed it) King Arthur, and it is by Norma
Goodrich, published by Harper and Row in their Perennial Library (paperback
and hardcover both available). I received a copy as a Twelfth Night gift and
it is surely one of the best such gifts I have ever received. Goodrich has
tremendous background in history, medieval literature, and linguistics and
the evolution of language. Using all these modern techniques, and by doing a
lot of library work and visiting of actual sites, she has reconstructed the
real story of King Arthur, the knights, the Round Table, Avalon, etc., by
peeling away inaccuracies and downright prejudices of the later writers
(Marie de France, Chretien de Troyes, etc.) and trying to figure out what
the lost original records must have said. The result is quite complementary
and different from the romantic picture handed down by Malory et al., and
while not fulfilling the dream that some prefer (be it sword and sorcery, or
tournaments and courtly love), it has fascinating tidbits about the culture
and history of the Britons, Picts, etc. For example, Goodrich believes that
Guinivere was a Pictish war queen named Guanhuamara in Pictish (not that
Pictish was ever written down), and that she engaged in a number of
practices we would view as quite barbaric (e.g., she supposedly kept the
embalmed heads of her conquered enemies and gazed at them often) -- talk
about women fighters! Anyway, for those interested in early period (5th to
6th century) this is quite an interesting study. And I am told that Goodrich
has also done a book on the historical Merlin ....

Message-ID: <890221-065741-2199@Xerox>

In response to Digest #248, - Firearms - Mike Litchfield makes some rather
strong attacks on firearms and the people who carry them.  I take exception
to some of the comments and would set the record straight that may be YOUR
concept of the S.C.A. but it most certainly is not mine.  My interest is in
military history and my persona is the most accurate portrayal of a late
period soldier that I can do.  You state yourself that firearms are period
but then dismiss them as some sort of bad dream.  If we have any claim at
all to being a historical society, we must look at the whole picture.

You find it necessary to mention that the firearms you are talking about
are non-functional.  I do assure you that the matchlocks, early flintlocks
and the artillery seen in the East Kingdom are all fully functional.  I
also find your comment that ANYONE can pull a trigger interesting.  The
manual of arms for a matchlock musket has 43 steps, many of which involve
juggling powder, musket, rest, and 3 feet of match, burning at both ends -
not what I'd recommend for an ill trained peasant levy.

With regard to courage and honour; form a rank of musketeers 100 feet in
front of your own lines, stay in ranks, fire 1 or 2 rounds per minute, all
the while facing a charging line of heavy cuiraseers.  This was called "The
Forlorn Hope" with some reason.

Lest you all believe this information is based in the 17th Century, I would
point out that these techniques were first used En Masse by Ferdinand II of
Aragon - in 1505.  Also, artillery was deciding the course of battles even
earlier - read the details of the Battle of Formigny in 1450.

There has been much on the net of late concerning the diversity of "The
Dream".  For some of us, it is authenticity and accuracy.  It has as much
validity as any other.

By introduction:  My persona in the SCA is a fervent Catholic and also 
a fervent classicist, neoplatonist, and alchemist.  Her social circle 
is recovering the "pagan texts" of Hermes Trimegestris, Plato, and 
just discovering the Kaballah.  Mundanely, I am a unitarian 
universalist and a neo-pagan, and an ardent ecumenist.

One of the biggest problems with history is that it is written by the 
aristocracy of the victors.  To believe that catholicism, no matter 
how much it claimed universality, was *the* spiritual path of europe in 
the middle ages, is naive.  

Healers, wise women, bonfires, planting practices, the rituals
involved in the certification of kings and lords, and a thousand
little details speak to the presence of the indigenous religions in
Europe throughout history. 

Christianity is a plastic religion.  Catholicism in South America is
different from Catholicism in the US is different from Southeast Asia
or South Africa and so on.  In each case, the religion *adapts* the
symbology of the indiginous religion, layers the soteriology (theology
of salvation) on top, infiltrates the social (if not political)
government, and takes over.  

It is only when the belief in "old gods" is perceived as a threat to
the church by fanatics that movements are started to suppress
paganism.  Otherwise, it is (something like) a 10% undercurrent in the
population, similar to homosexuality in more modern societies. 

Mayan catholics worship saints with their old gods names, practice the 
same festivals as of old (but without the blood sacrifices...!), and 
ascribe the same intermediary powers to the saints as they ascribed to 
the gods.  In rural central Vermont, where I grew up, there are still 
harvest bonfires, planting rituals, practices to insure the health of 
the young herd animals, and a lot of herbal healing--some of which has 
*nothing* to do with modern pharmacology (i.e. strewing mint in the 
barn to help heal a lame draft horse).  Any of the people 
participating will tell you that they are Christians, and they're 
right.  Some of them will also agree that they are practicing 
pre-christian religious rituals.  Some will say, out and out, that 
they are (inclusively or exclusively) pagan or neo-pagan.

Paganism and Christianity are not only symbiotic, but Christianity 
could not have succeeded without the synergistic effect of 
incorporating the indigenous beliefs.  How appropriate do most of you 
believe that a reformed version of Judaism (read: pre-constantine 
christianity) would be to Northern European non-literate cultures?

Also, recall that Jesus' birthday was set to conflict with the winter 
solstice (a time of lawlessness and renewal of law), his death made 
into an allegory of the return and resurrection of growth in the 
spring, and of the freedom from slavery through faith (spring equinox 
and Passover symbology).  I could go on.  Nevertheless, Christian and 
pagan faiths have always and will always be symbiotic and simultaneous 
in the culture.

I invite you to look at Shinto and Buddhism in Japan for another 
similar symbiosis.

Low level flame warning--pale yellow intensity--
At the event I just finished co-autocratting, myself and my other co-autocrat
paid full site and feast fee as did out cook and our helpers.  While we were
donating our time and labor, there still was the site and food to pay for.  My
attitude towards this is that the SCA falls under the heading of a "hobby/
extracurricular".  It takes volunteer effort to make it work and if you want
to be part of the group, you should be willing to put forth the effort to make
things happen without expecting monetary repayment.  We had more people
volunteering to help than we could use actually...
End flame which may actually have verged on blue intensity--

"Cumulative Melee Tourney"--It certainly is a great way to run a tourney.
When myself or the other list mistress in my barony ask the heavy listers or
the fencers what they would like to do, the response is always a "warlord
tourney", another name for the Cum.Mel.Tourn.  They just want the most possible
chances to fight.  Seems pretty reasonable to me ! :)

Re: "Cumulative" Tourney

Locally, this is known as a Warlord Tourney, and people (especially the
fighters) seem to enjoy it a lot. In a region where the tourney season is
quite short (May to September, with the middle taken out for Pennsic), the
fighters really seem to appreciate a tournament where they can do a *lot*
of fighting...

Re: Households

All right, I was going to be quiet about this, but it seems that, in many 
parts of the world, households are perceived as a bad thing, and I perceive
that perception as a bad thing.

Carolingia has been doing households of one sort and another pratically from
its inception, which was *quite* some time ago. We have a large number of
households, and all of the ones that have survived the test of time have done
much good for the Barony.

Households don't *have* to be cliques. Some are, to be sure, and they *can*
present a problem. The trick is to discourage such things, by encouraging
better forms of households. Examples of better forms of households:

-- Service houses. These are probably the most common type around here. The
   idea is that the households exists to serve and help the Barony. A large
   percentage of the officers of the Barony are, or have been, members of
   such households as Windy Hill or Chat Gris, which, from their charter on
   up, are dedicated to improving the Barony. Perhaps Taran or THE Sir Michael
   could give us an idea of how their houses work...

-- Arts houses. These are similar to service houses, but are more oriented
   towards promoting period arts in the Barony. An example is the recently-
   formed House Windsmeet, which is dedicated to the domestic arts of cooking,
   needlecraft, and the like.

-- The Burroughs (spelling varies). These are Carolingia's college groups, of
   which we currently have around six active. Although organized as SCA-style
   groups (ie, they generally have a seneschal, exchequer, herald, etc), they
   tend to be much more like households in spirit, with tighter bonds than the
   typical regional group. These exist primarily as a means for college
   students to get a toehold in the SCA, and are our main recruitment channel.
   Thus, they tend to provide a way of *encouraging* novices, rather than
   snubbing them. And since they are already oriented towards the newbie, they
   tend to help out *all* novices, not just the ones from their own colleges.

Any of these *could* become a clique; some have in the past. But by having a
focus beyond the social group, they tend to resist this temptation, bringing
new blood into themselves on a regular basis. I would say (and, I think, most
of the Barony would agree) that households are one of the pillars of this
Barony, not a liability at all...

William, the problem here is not what the government wants from us
-- it's what *we* want from the government. The only way we can
fiscally survive is by being a non-profit, educational organization.
Without the benefits that status entails (cheap 3-rd class mailing
rates, tax advantages for the corporation and the "volunteer"
officers and Board members, savings on insurance, etc), we can't
offer the services our members want and still keep our membership at
a low $20 per year.
 
And to maintain our non-profit educational status, we must follow
some of their rules -- and that includes the non-discrimination
clauses.

     In digest #248, Michael Litchfield mentions that he feels that
firearms are "just not SCA."  I would politely disagree.  I think 
a well-documented period matchlock, wheel-lock or other type of gun
could add something to a late-period persona.  Although I'm probably
biased in their favor because my father, who does 'black-powder' re-
enactment, makes Kentucky longrifles, I'm also a bit more familiar
with their history.  In period they were treated quite like the 
cross-bow was:  the Pope banned them, the nobility scorned them as
"unchivalrous", but the guns were used, and extensively so during
the sixteenth century.  (The connection with crossbows was quite
literal in one case--a very early specimen of circa 1521-26 is a
combination crossbow/wheel-lock gun.)
     There are, however, two major considerations that have kept me
from adding one to my wardrobe.  The first is that for our period,
an appropriate firearm is very difficult to lay hold of.  Neither I
nor my father can find a gunsmith who knows how to make  a wheel-lock
in North America.  Making one, at least in my case, is damn near 
impossible.   You also have to consider the legal problems in wearing
a gun, even a solely decorative one.  Unfortunately,  most states
don't discriminate between a collectible firearm and a purely 
utilitarian one.  I go to many other states in my Society-related
travels, and I'm sure a gun would get me into trouble sooner or
later.  'Tis a shame, though.  Just another mundane consideration
that limits us.

  I always thought that it was OK to wave steel around as long as you're
in a large, empty space (preferably outdoors), you warn anyone within earshot, 
and you make absolutely sure that no one is even *close* to where your blade
will be (remember that a sword *can* slip out of your hand in mid-swing).

  I was taught, when I first joined the SCA, that you should go outside if
you want to swing swords around.  If weather (or something else) prevents this,
be content with just looking at the blade (or, if you *must*, find an empty
room/hallway somewhere).  I was also told that bare steel at court is a no-no,
and that if you are called up for an award or something, you should shed *all*
steel (I think they told me that knights, King's/Queen's champions, etc. didn't
do this since they should always be prepared to "defend" the royalty).

  On top of that, people really should use a little common sense.  Sharp (and
even not-so-sharp) blades are *DANGEROUS*.  I don't see anything wrong with
holding a bare blade across the arm or something to admire it, but if you
want to swing it around, even just a little bit to get the "feel" of the
weapon, *STOP*.  Remember that it is a *weapon*.  Look around you at where
that edge will fall if you drop it, trip over something, or just misjudge
your swing.  If it's all clear, go ahead.  If there's even the slightest
chance that you could injure someone, take it somewhere else.

Subject:      Households

The statements about households and their detrimental effect on SCA groups
has caused me to stop and ponder a bit, and I wonder...wouldn't people who
use formal households to form an  exclusionary group and determine local
activities to fit to their whims find some other way of doing so if households
didn't exist?  People who want to form "clique-ish" (to use that hated high
school word) groups or to have large amounts of power and control always find
a way to do so, even if a formal structure doesn't exist.

I don't think households are stunningly good or stunningly bad--thankfully
because the household I belong to was chartered on February 11.  My household
is composed of four women, all of whom are friends and share activities and all
of whom have lived in the same apartment at some time.  Hence the name, House
Windsmeet,as the apartment is at the top of a windy hill.  For us it was a
formal statement of an arrangement which already existed among the four of us.
We are friends who share the same interests and see each other often.  When
we have existed a while longer we will probably invite other into the household

While we do spend time with each other at events--natural since we are friends-
-we spend more time talking to others new and old.  Where's the fun in spending
all your time talking to someone you already know when there are so many other
interesting people around?

What good do we do for our local group?
Depends if you're looking at us as individuals or a group.  As individuals
the four of us number a list mistress, chatelaine (keeper of baronial stuff),
needleworkers guildmistress, council secretary, baronial librarian, compiler of
the baronial phone/address book, ex-dance mistress, two frequent event cooks,
occassional autocrats, deputy whatever we call the person who answers questions
for new people, and a few other things I can't remember.  Sounds like
we run the Barony?  No way.  In the Barony of Carolingia that barely makes a
dent.  We are just doing our part.  As a household we have each other to draw
upon, for advice, support or manual labor.  And we try to make an extra effort
to give something back to the Barony to uphold our household name.  What the
household gives to the Barony is the added strength we gain in our individual
efforts by being able to draw upon each other.

As to the question about the head of the household leading the pack--I wouldn't
know.  We have a head of household in name only.  I wouldn't join a household
that wasn't a democracy of individuals.  I don't like moving in a pack.

I daresay the diverse personalities in my household have trampeled a few toes
in their time, but I don't believe we are an instrument of ill will like some
of the descriptions of other households.  The nature of the household, like an
elected office or a royal one, depends upon the people filling it.  If someone
wants to form an exclusive group or manipulate a barony, they'll organize a
group behind them regardless of whether they call it a household or not.

   I have a temporary fix to the problem as follows:

      quit
  
   This has worked for me as anonymous.  There is apparently a vertical

Thanks to all the gentles who responded to my plea for the lyrics to

Subject: Fantasy Personas

I've been reading a lot about personas coming from fantasy environments,
but everything I've been reading implies that, if you have a fantasy
persona, you are an elf.  Is it also implying then that there are no
other fantasy personas other then elves or other faerie creatures?  I
certainly hope not.  I would consider my own persona to be a fantasy
persona, but I in no way whatsoever consider myself to be an elf.  Why
can't the term "Fantasy Environment" just mean an evironment not found
in this world's history?  I've been asked "Why have a persona from a
different world when this world's history has so much to offer you?"
But this world's history can't offer me what I want.  In order for me
to get what I want out of SCA my persona must come from another place,
another time; and if I'm going to be told that I can't have it, then
what's the sense of being in the group?  It's almost like choosing a
career in life, or perhaps even a marriage partner; if you don't think
you're going to want to be with it for the rest of your life then
don't settle for it in the first place.  So why should I settle for
less than I want when choosing a persona?  Afterall, that is who I
am and am going to be for the rest of my life, right?  So what is the
ruling on this kind of a persona?
