Yeah...secret society! great idea!  and we can have passwords that
one-way-encrypt to tokens that we can distribute over the net to foil
the NSA and other nasty-evil-spying-communist-facist-libertarianists!!!

Then when we meet at an event we can whip out the lap-top run the
encryption algorithm to verify our identity!! Boy this could be a lot
of fun!

Greetings unto the Net!

Now that I've finished wading through the back digests which accumulated
whilst I was gone (2 weeks is a **LOT** of mail...), I'd like to offer some
comments.

I **LOVE** the Secret Society idea!! Apart from being suitably unofficial and
workable, it's suitably humorous.  I do think, though, that we _will_ need to
agree on some visual means of recognizing each other, or we'll never get to
play with this concept.  Of those "insignia" which have been discussed, the
one which seems to have struck people as the most inocuous, while still
tickling funny bones, is the piece of netting idea.  The stuff is certainly
cheap enough, and readily obtainable.  Maybe if we all agree to stick to
thoroughly obnoxious, garish colors, we can both effect the desired results
while not creating a situation wherein non-Net members get confused.  I also
like referring to the net as "the Rialto."  This is also fun, and as good a
means of reference as any.

So picture it:  the next time you see someone wearing a piece of
neon-chartreuse netting, you too will be able hail them and ask for news from
the Rialto!

About awards:  my only comments are (again) that we need to remember just how
many aspects of the Society came about spontaneously and by chance, not by
planning and logic.  Like, most of them.  Also, like any other system, the SCA
will never be perfect. So, I always advise people to try to maintain their
perspective and to strive for equitability whenever possible, because that's
the best we can achieve.

Lastly:  I too find it difficult to conceive of Lady Majir blushing, but it's
definitely possible as she took lessons from the best-- Viscountess Elitha of
the Entwining Stars.  (Now _there's_ someone who can _blush_.)  Indeed, it was
Lady Majir who helped sponsor Viscountess Elitha's Last Royal Blush during her
last Court as Princess of Trimaris.  So, when Majir *does* blush, no doubt you
can bet it's worth seeing!  (How about it, Marj?  Huh?  Please?)

Subject:  DANCING; "MUNDANE"; GROUP PERSONAE; AWARDS

Greetings!

This is more "backlog commentary" on my part, regarding recent subjects of
discussion.

DANCING:  I've always seen it work very well at events, including on-the-spot
teaching.  Thanks to the latter, there are a couple of dances just about
_every_ Trimarian knows-- and when they come up at an event, everyone in the
vicinity joins in them!  _A propos_ of this discussion:  Masque Balls are
pretty popular in Trimaris, and make for a really neat post-feast evening!

"MUNDANE" (AS A PEJORATIVE):  As has been noted to some extent already, one
must be careful how one uses "mundane" in a Society context as well.
Something which happened to me illustrates perfectly how I mean this:  there
is a site in west Tampa which is frequently used for Trimaris events.  As my
sister lives in Tampa, if my parents are visiting her family and I go to an
event at Camp Keystone, the lot of them will pop over for a visit.  Having
arrived on site for one such visit, the whole fam damily were seeking me at the
main hall.  When they found me, they told me that they had passed a young
woman who had grimaced and said, "Ugh! *Mundanes!*" in a rather unpleasant
tone of voice.  Needless to say, this was _most_ upsetting.  (As a matter of
fact, I would _still_ love to find out who this was...)  Thankfully, this was
far from the first time my family had been around an event, and they realized
this was atypical.  The point, however, remains:  have a care-- courtesy
sometimes requires forethought.

GROUP PERSONAE:  For a small, private group such as a household; fine.  But
for an entire shire, I must say I find the idea somewhat repugnant.  It seems
to me it would stifle the diversity the Society has always thrived on.  I
know, for example, that I would not know nearly as much about Japan or
Scandinavia as I do now had it not been for the wide variety of personae to be
found in my Barony.  I consider learning to be at the heart of the SCA's
existence, and variety leads to lots of lively and informative interchange!

AWARDS:  Lots of good, necessary, and *CORRECT* things have been said about
Letters of Recommendation and the need to get off one's duff and write them.
I think it was Arval who pointed out that gentles getting together for, say, a
guild meeting could take a few minutes out to dash off one or more (someone
correct me if it wasn't Arval).  This is true, and an excellent idea, but one
to which I would add a word of caution:  beware accidentally producing "carbon
copy"  LoR's.  When playing "Royal Herald" I would occassionally have to deal
with Letters of Recommendation, and beleive me, it shows when letters are the
result of someone walking in and saying "OK, we're all going to write a letter
recommending Soandso for an AoA now."  Such letters can all turn out alike.
So, in instances where a group is to take a few minutes to sit down all
together, write from your own first-hand knowledge.  Also:  here in Trimaris
we tend to stress several individual LoR's over one or two signed by lots of
people, as experience has shown that the "petition mode" of recommendation
occassionly leads to people adding their names because they've been pressured
to do so instead of because they really wanted to.  Very, very wrong; and
unpleasant-- but it (unfortunately) _does_ happen.

To all who read this:  thanks for your time!

Greetings!

On the off chance that no one else has bothered to post who won the recent
Trimaris Crown Tourney, I thought I would.  The victor was Duke Sir Baldar
Longstriter; his consort is Countess Mistress Elspeth MacNaughton of Loch Awe.
As I was unable to attend the event, I know only this, and that the event
itself is said to have been very pleasant for all.

But since haste+@ANDREW.CMU.EDU said

That means we have to come up with a comprimise to to this.  It will 
probably make any true herald go into conniptions, but how about simply 
describing the color of both the foreground net and the background to be
sable?  "Cheqy per bend, sable, on sable" or some such nonsense.  Of 
course you could always use flat paint for the background and gloss for 
the net since we've made no effort so far to please heralds.  That way
you can see the net when you look closely enough.

Not being too familiar with heraldry, I don't know if there are such things
as implied borders drawn around things where the color would be the same.

Hmmmm...  I wonder how much string it would take to tie together a net
T-tunic.

 I missed the beginning of this, and do not know what was said. But I
am
distressed that I have not seen anyone mention that it was written by
Sydney
Carter. After the fuss over the copyright of "Beowabbit", one would
expect
more care over acknowledgement to living authors.

Greetings!

With regard to a name for the Secret Society-to-be:  in my not-so-humble
opinion, for it to qualify as a *REAL* name for a *REALLY AND TRULY* Secret
Society, the initials _must_ form some sort of cryptic acronym (like
U.N.C.L.E.) or cryptic referral phrase (like "Triple-M S.").

I've been trying to make something out of "Rialto," but am so far
unsuccessful.

Any ideas, anyone?

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh! NOT THE 'P' WORD! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

Sorry about that. But *please* try to avoid the use of (shudder) 'proper'
in devices or badges, it has been known to inspire fits of violent behavior
in the College of Arms members... :^)

Besides, this would not give the desired effect, at the wee beasties eyes,
mouth, etc., would be floating upon a field of black... a sable sable would
be correct, if redundant.

Perhaps overall an inescutchon sable throughout?

Message-Id: <1095@hjuxa.UUCP>

About the word mundane, used even among ourselves:
i took a very skittish friend to an event. he tried
his best to play along, but conversation kept going
(despite my best efforts) to "freaking the mundanes" 
and how yucky mundanes are, and soforth. in fact, when
my friend mentioned that this was his first event, a
woman said, voice dripping with disdain "oh, you're 
a MUNDANE" and promptly ignored him. needless to say,
this was his last event, and my last event at that
group. We were all mundane once. In fact we all spend 
most of our time "in mundania". It seems agreed that
the word is not good for public relations. However,
it is so deeply ingrained in our vocabulary, that
i doubt people will switch words. perhaps an article
written for TI might at least bring it to people's attention.

About entire groups taking the same persona: When I lived
in another place a friend and I were interested in the SCA.
He called up for information, and they said "oh, you can't
be a 9th century Welsh person, you have to be a 12th century
italian" or some such. This response is why it took me
4 more years to bother talking to anyone in the SCA. 
Group personae are rather off putting (as a relative new person
myself, i can remember what attracted me to the sca and
what bothered me about the idea). New members need direction
and guidance, not to be told that their ideas of "the dream"
or whatever are worthless.

Speaking of new members, does anyone out there have good
suggestions about attracting and keeping new members
(both on college campuses and in the working population)?

    its a secret and I won't tell you

THE NET:

    is it me, or hasn't our discussions of late been rather self-centered?
    lets discuss something is of immediate importance to the society?  Like:
    1) should or should not the society include Cavalier personna?  Should or
       should not the society include non-european personna?  Should we limit
       personna at all? and if so, by what guidelines?  
    2) are art & science competitions worthwhile?
    3) does straight historical research deserve recognition?
    4) should there be society-wide organizations other than peerages?  (Society
       Guilds for instance)
    5) This net and the society as a whole has been labelled: too american, or 
       "dominently american"... what does this mean?  is it bad?  and does this
       harm our work recreating the middle ages and renaisance?
    6) anybody heard any good stories of late?

They sure did.  Gregory's problem had quite a few constraints on it.  The
primary one, the one that made the reform 'urgent', was that Easter had to fall
in the Spring.  At the same time, although a ten-day correction was needed, it
would have been sacrilege to misplace Sunday.  The obvious solution would have
been to let the matter slide another five centuries and then drop two weeks, but
Gregory was too impatient.

What they did was move from Thursday, Oct. 4 to (the next day) Friday Oct. 15.
(I think I've got those dates right.)  Needless to say, this put many idiot
savants out of business :-)

Subject:  HI FOLKS!  I'M BACK AND ALREADY ADDING _MY_ 2 CENTS!

Greetings unto the Net!

Now that I've finished wading through the back digests which accumulated
whilst I was gone (2 weeks is a **LOT** of mail...), I'd like to offer some
comments.

I **LOVE** the Secret Society idea!! Apart from being suitably unofficial and
workable, it's suitably humorous.  I do think, though, that we _will_ need to
agree on some visual means of recognizing each other, or we'll never get to
play with this concept.  Of those "insignia" which have been discussed, the
one which seems to have struck people as the most inocuous, while still
tickling funny bones, is the piece of netting idea.  The stuff is certainly
cheap enough, and readily obtainable.  Maybe if we all agree to stick to
thoroughly obnoxious, garish colors, we can both effect the desired results
while not creating a situation wherein non-Net members get confused.  I also
like referring to the net as "the Rialto."  This is also fun, and as good a
means of reference as any.

So picture it:  the next time you see someone wearing a piece of
neon-chartreuse netting, you too will be able hail them and ask for news from
the Rialto!

About awards:  my only comments are (again) that we need to remember just how
many aspects of the Society came about spontaneously and by chance, not by
planning and logic.  Like, most of them.  Also, like any other system, the SCA
will never be perfect. So, I always advise people to try to maintain their
perspective and to strive for equitability whenever possible, because that's
the best we can achieve.

Lastly:  I too find it difficult to conceive of Lady Majir blushing, but it's
definitely possible as she took lessons from the best-- Viscountess Elitha of
the Entwining Stars.  (Now _there's_ someone who can _blush_.)  Indeed, it was
Lady Majir who helped sponsor Viscountess Elitha's Last Royal Blush during her
last Court as Princess of Trimaris.  So, when Majir *does* blush, no doubt you
can bet it's worth seeing!  (How about it, Marj?  Huh?  Please?)

We are stuck with the modern connotations of perfectly good English words
rendering them unusable, mundane being another example. That being the case,
I feel that we should abandon the term fraternity.

Given the religious meaning of Fishermen, I will add a vote for Fishmongers
as our name ( assuming that we need one ). Fishwives would be better except
that the macho types might not approve. Either way the connotation is with
gossipers.

I am also not happy with the association with guilds. I totally agree with
malice's arguements and suggest that the need for a secret password
verification, or non verification, will encourage us not to interrupt each
other when we are not in the mood. 

The unfortunate part is that a rejection of authentication may block the
enquirer from attempting to make contact ever again. We need a response
that means 'Yes, I am one of us but I will not discuss it at this time.'
Perhaps 'I need time to mend my nets' followed a suggestion of a meeting 
time and place.

At a demo, Steffan, where the difference between Society folk and guests
existed and had to be addressed occasionally.  This lands on my ear as
mundane or newby.  In the wrong place, it bothers me.  Demos are where we
are being our persona and yet still must interact with 20th Century CE
citizens of whatever country.  Best foot forward and all that.

Actually, those groups are as unknown to me as the lands of the Cathay and
Araby would have been to Bart the Bewildered in 1365. They do not have the
same connections of feudalism, nor the reward system which is as universal
at the peer level in the SCA as the Church of Rome was to Europe. The rules
are different for belief and behavior. I am aware they exist, but I do not
KNOW them.

If this is Scadia, then I'm a Scadian. If this is SCA, then I deny the name.
And to all who say "Canada->Canadian and Acadia->Cajun ;-)", I retort that
SCA is to Scadian as America is to Americadian, and I'm an American (well,
States'er [sp?] if the reader is non US ;-). And I'm sure a lot of
Italidians probably would empathize.

There should be no reason for this. I only worry when others are around. In
context, I should not have to mention SCA. If the SCA is mentioned in Court
this tells me that someone is lazy and not thinking of correct ways to say
things. The exception being the Orders of Chivalry which, unfortunately or
not, include the name of the Society to differentiate them from other orders
of chivalry. (BTW, why was this needed? Any body know?)

And that is a difference between us. I mean to give no offense, I am simply
trying to show my thinking.  Since we are not officially "Scadia" the term
"Scadian is a semantic null to me and I would discourage it's use. It is
especially repugnant at those one shot teaching sessions that we call
"Demos" since, like "mundane" and "Newby", it fosters an "us vs. them, and
us is superior" feel in the guests.  I finish with a couple of more
additions to our lexical map, especially for demos and other interactions
with the 20th Century culture.

I had intended not to respond to any of the comments on my scadian gripe,
but something went snap the other day. This was not meant to be a point by
point rebuttal to Steffan's comments, I really agree with many of them. His
well thought out and presented arguments were a ready resource to help me
marshal my own, thus avoiding arguments like: "Yes!" "No!" "I'm Gonna SO

to carry on an adult discussion with one's parents, but I digress)

These are only my views and no Angel touched me on the forehead and gave me

Subject: calenders


I beg to differ with Milady Malice's notion of the usage of the term
"C.E." to refer to our calender.  I see this term used all the time, in
books about Islamic history.  "C.E." for either "Common Era" or
"Christian Era" seems to be in general usage, either because (1)
sensitive writers of Islamic history do not want to inadvertently
offend non-Christain readers, or (2) "C.E." constrasts much more
strongly than "A.D." (Ante Divinite [sp?]) with "A.H." (After Heejra),
the Muslam Calender.  What makes it all the more fun is that the
Islamic Calender is an uncorrected Lunar one, so that the seasons
slowly but surly rotate through the months, and we tend to gain one
year in 33 on the gregorian calendar.

The nicest thing about using the Islamic Calender is that "Period" is
approximately 1 A.H. (622 C.E.) to 1000 A.H. (1592 C.E.).

Subject: secret password

The obvious secret password is the password "secret."

Also, I agree with Malice as to the reasons for secret societies.  Most secret
societies (historically) exist not to exclude outsiders, but to protect in-
siders from undue notice (by political and/or religious enemies, generally).

Freemasons are a modern example of a society which is the opposite--so far as
I can tell--of the original idea of the secret society.  They are a male-
bonding club which exists to be exclusive (i.e. define a membership) within
which context they can be open.  This is quite different from, say, a hermetic
or alchemical society which must be secret in some periods of history due to
the danger of dominicane pyros.  (I suspect I might hear back from a few of
the masons on the net, but it does seem to be the modern charter of the 
group, guys...)

And I see us as being a hack on the concept of the secret society of the 
hermetic type.  We have access to dangerous technological secrets, that, in
the hands of the stick jocks, could be put to terrible purposes to the 
detriment of the world...  (look at most of the ARPA research...:-)

Message-Id: <14912@mimsy.UUCP>

The following is excerpted from the United States Naval Observatory
Stargazing Notes for February 1988, written by Gail Cleere of the USNO.

======================================================================

Thirty days hath September,
April June and November.
All the rest have 31,
February alone has 28,
Except in Leap Year, at which time,
February's Days are 29:

First taxes, then Leap Seconds, now this. A Leap Day. We get an extra
second tacked onto our clocks at the end of 1987, and an extra day
added to February 1988, just to find out that we never did get the
calendar year just right (we've been at it for 5,000 years), and the
year is still 26 seconds too long anyway. Welcome to the planet Earth.
This story involves a cast of thousands, is long, confusing, fraught
with danger and dissidence, a "thoroughly messy subject," says
astronomer LeRoy Doggett (whose job it is to figure these things out),
but here it is...

The year, or the motion of the Earth around the Sun, is measured from
Equinox to Equinox (a particular place in the sky, against which we
wait for the Sun to appear). Doing this, we find that the year is
365.2422 days long.

Back around 46 B.C., Julius Caesar didn't know all this to such
precision, but he did know he was living by a calendar that was 3
months out of sync with the seasons. His Greek astronomer, Sosigenes,
knew that the year was about a quarter of a day too long, and he made
some very clever suggestions that seemed like nifty ideas to Caesar. At
that time, in Rome as well as in much older kingdoms, the fellow on the
throne regularly inserted or deleted days from the calendar whenever
his astronomers recommended it. So, in 46 B.C., Caesar ordered an extra
67 days packed into the calendar, an extra day for the end of every
fourth February (the last month of the year in those days) and with all
this instituted what we now call The Julian Calendar Reform. The year
46 B.C., without question, became known as "The Year of Confusion", but
things were at last back on track - for awhile, that is.

There was one small problem. Sosigenes did a little too much rounding
off. The difference between .2422 of a day and one quarter of a day is
.0078 of a day, or 11 minutes. Sosigenes and Caesar were long gone
before anyone noticed it, however. By 1582 A.D., all these extra
minutes had added up to a whopping 10 days.  And so, the seasons were
slipping backwards again - spring into winter, winter into fall, and so
on.

Along came Pope Gregory the Thirteenth, who realized what was
happening. "Drat!" he said*, and sent his astronomers back to the
drawing board. He established a commission to figure it all out and
here's what they said to do: order 10 days dropped from the calendar,
and declare that henceforth the centennial years would be Leap Years
only if divisible by 400. That would get the whole thing back in gear,
and it would be thousands of years before the seasons would slip out of
joint again. (With a year that is still 26 seconds too long, we will
accumulate 1 day every 3,000 years.) October 5 - 14 became the days
that never existed in 1582. Well, the crowds went wild...

The Gregorian Calendar, or the New Style, as it was called, was
immediately (but probably grudgingly) adopted by France, Portugal,
Spain and of course Italy. These were Catholic countries. The German
Protestants, fond of neither Popes nor Papal Bulls, waited another 120
years or so to accept it, and it wasn't until 1752 that England and her
colonies finally knuckled under. By that time the calendar was 11 days
out of step with the seasons. September 2 to 13 were then lopped off
the calendar, and with that, the general populace took to the streets.
The cry became "Give us back our fortnight!" accompanied by riots, and
lots of general misunderstanding, like, for example, that being robbed
of 11 days, one would thus die early. Many communities adamantly clung
to the Old Style (one still sees "O.S." on many gravestones) until
forced by a new generation to adopt the change.

Japan made the change in 1873, not long after Commodore Matthew Perry,
in a memorable display of gunboat diplomacy, opened the gates of Japan
to the West. China adopted the Gregorian Calendar in 1911. But it
wasn't until the Bolsheviks had come to power, and Pope Gregory had
been dead over 300 years, that the Russians finally came around. They
did one more thing, too, and that was to further refine the rule to say
that centennial years would be Leap Years only if, after dividing the
date by 900, the remainder is either 200 or 600. The Soviet calendar
therefore, is about 5 times as accurate as anyone elses.

Well, this is the sort of problem that Dr. Doggett, along with his
colleagues at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, grapples with in order
to determine the dates of the seasons published in our yearly Almanacs.
Calendar reform is a troublesome and awkward subject, one which
generates hundreds of calls and letters to the Naval Observatory. It
may explain why Dr. Doggett keeps this sign up over his desk:

Christmas and New Year's have been cancelled.
Go directly to dyeing eggs.

* Or something like that.

     I don't beg to differ, I just differ.  We know about Acre, Markland,
and the Tuchux in persona, therefore they are part of the Known World.
As a matter of fact there are a lot of things that we know about in
persona which aren't officially part of the SCA.  Even a lot of the
*people* in the Known World are non-members.  Need I say more?
     As for Mundania (or Mundenmark ;-) ), we don't know about it in
persona unless reminded by the presence of obtrusive mundanity.
     As I see it, the reason for the term "Known World" is that in
persona, we don't know about anything mundane, including the non-profit
organization called the SCA.  Therefore, this term is perfectly correct.
It makes exactly the right distinction between the current-medieval
world and the real world.

The word sorority was coined in 1874 by Reverend Brown to refer
to a group of women forming the group gamma phi beta at syracuse
college. up to this point there were several women's groups referred
to as fraternities after the men's groups they were patterned after.

Now as for this fisherMEN business. if i were to fish, i ould
be a fisherwoman or preferably a fisher. I don't buy this "man is
generic for human" stuff.

Sorry about the rampant feminism, but there it is. how about
a more generic term, like companions, compatriots, comrades?
i don't know. the alliteration of fraternity of fishermen is nice,

Subject: SCA in Kalamazoo, Mi.??

Milords and Ladies:
 
The group in Kalamazoo, Michigan, is part of The Barony of
Andelcrag. The local canton is called Three Hills (Kalamazoo is
built in a valley between three hills -- well, as much hills as
glacier-scraped Michigan ever gets!)
 
The local seneschal is named Madeleine of York, a most welcoming
lady. Her name is Susan Hunter, phone (616) 388-4359. Her address
is:
       719 W. Kalamazoo Avenue, Apt 2
       Kalamazoo, MI 49007
 
The baron, a delightful coot, is Ritter Baron Karl Aerdigwidder von
Zauberberg, aka David Schreuer, address
       1602 Jefferson Avenue
       Kalamazoo, MI 49007
 
These folks have a lovely tourney every February known as the St.
Valentine's Day massacre. It's theme is hearts and axes, and a
highlight of the day (besides the very interesting Melee tourneys,
which Master Robyyan will have to tell you about) is the interesting
arts/sciences contests which they think up using these themes.
 
St. Valentine's is scheduled for February 18 this year.
 
Kalamazoo is about 4 hours from Detroit (Roaring Wastes), where our
Twelfth Night is being held this year. (the Kingdom twelfth Night,
that is. There are several other Tnights scheduled). 4 hours travel
is a very reasonable Middle Kingdom traveling time, by the way.
There is a reasonable amount of crash space in Detroit, as well as
inexpensive lodging. Lord Dmitri, if your lady will be in town by
January 14, she would be most welcome to attend.
 
Details:
         Fees: 8.50 before January 1, Site fee in addition $3.00
 
        Contact the autocrat, Ilisabetta d'Ostia, aka

                   (313) 354-6721 6pm -11pm EST
 
The feast is being cooked by Mistress Jehanne de St. Brieuc, a
formidable cook in her own right who learned feastocratting at the
hands of the inestimable Duchess Caellyn y'Vearn.
 
The site fee includes a luncheon board from 12-3 pm. Court will be
held in the afternoon to provide more time for dancing after the
feast.
 
By order of their Majesties Reynard and Brynhildr, this will be a
Byzantine court.
 
(gosh! I hope the fact that court is being held during the day means
that there won't be time for endless Chivalry, Pelican and Laurel
meetings during the afternoon!)
 
At any rate, Lord Dmitri, if your lady is in town for any of these
events we'd be pleased to meet her. In fact, we love meeting any
far-flung travelers!

Subject: More on Bad Words

I'm thrilled with Master Steffan's list of words that can be
substituted. I think that's a marvelous thing -- (Except for
Mistland, which my stubbord Middle Kingdom soul says is "too
western!"... but that's another point...!)
 
I do not want to lose track of one point in all this goodness, tho,
and that is the effect our use of mundane has on other people,
people who aren't in the group, who are considering joining but
haven't made a decision, etc.
 
Unthinking use of this word can be terribly harmful. Just like the
gentles (and I'm afraid I use the term loosely) who said obnoxious
things about Catholics and Wiccans to the rector of one Middle
Kingdom site, and thus lost us a lovely spot for events, we need to
consider our audience. My particular emphasis is on how our printed
and spoken words advertise the SCA, and calling people "mundanes"
and using the term in our conversations and official letters,
policies, etc, affects a number of non-scafolk very badly.
 
(My own roommate in 1984 was so offended by my casual use of the
term "mundanes" when discussing a demo that she never again was
willing to talk about my SCA life. I think this was over-reacting,
but I've heard of parents and other potential members being equally
offended.)
 
What I'm asking for, I guess, is excision of this word from at least
our official printed matter. Newsletters, flyers, handbooks, etc. If
it remains a jargon word, let it be one that we use only with
ourselves, and not to speak of other people. Remember, that first
impression is a lasting one, and people who have problems with us
usually aren't hesitant about sharing their negatie impressions.

My lord Japanesse, I congratulate you on your stroke of brilliance.
In one masterful missive, you have solved the problem vexing the minds
of great men and women the world over.  May I now suggest that we
need not merely one or two names and passwords, but many?  The more
names that describe the society, the more mysterious it becomes.
Who's to tell which is the correct name?  And which group is connected
to which other group, and by what signs and ties?  In this vein, I
hesitate to mention the existance of a group going by the name of the
"Entourage of the Fisher King," which (rumor has it) is intimately
connected with the membership of the "Strands of the Seven Realms."
(Both of which, it should be noted, have ties to yet a third society
whose very name is shrouded by the mists of vows of silence...)

A little too simple, Arval.

Direct conflict with :

GOURNAY - "Sable."

Also in conflict by outline with :

d'ALBRET - "Gules."
de MENEZES - "Or."
AUBERT - "Purpure."
MAIENTAL - "Azure."
PUPELLIN - "Vert."
ZGRALIA - "Argent."

However, these may be argued to be clear by complete-difference-of-charge

I love the idea!  The one about something representing communication
wrapped in a net is also good.  Should I see someone wearing netting
and/or a solid black badge, I shall sidle up and whisper "What news
on the Rialto?"  On receiving the correct response, I shall ask "do
you know the password".  If the answer is "no", then I will say "neither

Or maybe an inclandestine clandestine encounter.

Well, I have strong reservations about the use of the word "fraternity". As a 
student at Wellesley (_WOMEN_'s College, not girl's school, thank you) I feel 
compelled to point out the gender-specific terminology in the above phrase.  I 
would not feel comfortable belonging to anything that called itself a 
fraternity.  The idea of a fraternity embodies not only a brotherhood aspect 
(which by definition excludes women), but also implies exclusivity (i.e. 
pledging and hazing).  One could also carry this argument to the "fisherman" 
part of the phrase, however "fisherpeople" doesn't sound right and "apostles" 
goes into the religious arena, which most would like to avoid. Any suggestions?
Society of Sea Folk?  I can deal with "fishermen" if need be, but not 
fraternity.

I _like_ this device. It'ld be entirely too appropriate. Also, I'ld like to

Why of course! How short sighted of me. We should publish an arbitrarily
large number of passwords. These passwords may be correct or incorrect,
and this in and of itself does not necessarily imply the existance or lack
of existance of the password in the first place. Furthermore, all members
of the secret society should receive the exact same information, and only
the members of the inner cabal will actually know what the correct password,
if any, is. Furthermore, we should not select an inner cabal as in doing so,
we risk its infiltration by spies as well, so only the non-existant inner
cabal truly knows the secrets of the secret society!

[ The following text is SECRET, so anyone not in the secret society, or better ]

No flames here, just an attempt to explain one persons view of the situation.

For practical purposes, what we are proposing is a farce of a secret society.
It is not exclusive as anyone on the net is implied to be a member. Anyone
not on the net could etither be "initiated" by allowing them to read a posting
from the net, or be dubbed a counterspy or co-conspirator or be told that
they're a member whether they like it or not. We have proposed no restrictions
in membership that would differ from the shire or household models previously
proposed. In fact, the absurdity of the situation could be amplified by
declaring that everyone else in the Known World is a member of the Secret
Society except oneself, as everyone else is obviously a spy for The Society.
I feel that everyone who wants to have fun with the concept, will, if good
taste and carefull application of humerous shtick prevail, have adaquate
oppertunity to "be a member" and "join in the fun".

ARGGH!

put on your asbestos jackets, everyone

1) I have never never never used the alias 'capriol'  If it is nescessary to 
identify me in the context of that particular exchange of arguments, you may 
refer to me as "malice, who was once incorrectly identified as 'capriol'"

2) random quotes:  "I feel a secret society is too exclusive."  
"password..determined, but not over the net."  Nonsense.  The society is 
secret because persons of tact, breeding, and intelligence will not refer to 
it in public.  The function of the password is not to keep non-netters out, 
but to keep netters out of the hair of good folk who don't want to be bothered 
with it at the time. (hmm... i can think of a few other groups which might 
benefit from the same sort of thing).  The password should not only be 
determined over the net, it should be published in the newsletters.  Some 
nice, simple, unbotrusive item ('badge') should be chosen that people can 
wear to show that they are amenable to aproach by other netters.  (or not 
worn, if they are not)  A bit of net seems to be popular, and i can think of 
very few objections to it (Itanlian renn. lords in fishnet stockings being 
one)    "Society of Fishermen"  Sorry, no.  I am going to ruin the argument 
following (4) by saying that that name is slightly too christain in 
connotation for me to be comfortable with it.  How about "fishmongers"?-- it's 
connected with both fishnets and market places and has more mundane 
conotations.

3)  guilds.  The function of a guild is to ensure the quality of the craft or 
service controlled by the guild, to regulate apprentice ships, to keep prices 
high, and to keep outsiders out.  Only the first realy applies to SCA guilds, 
which strive to ensure the quality of their crafts by encourageing knowledge 
of and practice of these crafts by as many as will, pooling knowledge and 
resources, and (sometimes) regulating apprenticeships.  This often involves a 
lot of sitting around talking, but (with the exception of the nascent guild of 
story tellers) I can think of none that involve nothing else.  (the fellowship 
of philosophers newver was and still is not a guild (right, Steven?))

4)  AD/CE    CE is not an unused term, but it is unusual.  A.D. is still (as
of 1986 colliers encyclopedia (do *not* tell me that dictionaries and 
encyclopedias do not use the most current and common usages, because they do))
the current common usage in western europe & the U.S. (any one know what is 
used in the U.S.S.R.?)    
(long supportive argument having the appearance of a digression.  There 
is a significant population out there that doesn't speak latin and is under 
the impression that, since 'b.c.' stands for 'before christ', 'a.d.' must 
stand for 'after death', and judging from the stories i hear about high school 
students, i suspect there is an even larger on that has no idea what either 
means.  A few months ago, there was an article in the boston globe about 
ethnic slurs, among them 'paddy wagon'.  In a household of 7-9 people, only 
one had been aware previously of the pejorative origen of this phrase (he even 
knew what it was and was not (to me, at least) obvious), and he was also the 
only one with a background of that ethnicity.  20 years ago, people who used 
called themselve 'black' were radical.  15 years ago, people who called 
themselves 'Ms.' were not only radical, but suspected of being lesbian.)
Conclusion:  People using CE are making a statement about their 
religious/political views, people using a.d. are not.

5) FLAME OFF!  Those of you who skipped (4) may come out from under the covers 
and read the following prosthelitization, because it *may* actually interest 
you!

in mundane contexts, on seldom sees a.d. written, unless one is reading about 
events that occured within about 800 years of year 1 (a.d.), or comparing 
dates in other calenders.  In persona, on the other hand, one should *never* 
use the term 'common era' (obviously)  what one should use is:

Personae in what was the roman empire until around a.d. 532:  used the roman 
callender, which was regularized by julius ceasar in bc 45.  year 1 U.A.C. = 
753 b.c. (uac stands for 'the year the city was founded', i think)

personae in christan lands from around 532 on used the "julan callender", but 
it was decided that jesus of nazereth had been born on december 25, and that 
all years hence forth would be counted from march 25 of the new year 1.  (the 
julian *day* was invented in 1582 and named after the inventors father. 1 J.D. 
is january 1, 4713 bc and the *days* are counted which puts us somewhere 
around 2,386,000 J.D.)

in 1582 pope gregory 13 invented the 'gregorian callender' (this is not the 
gregory of gregorian chant, that was greg.I) which is pretty much the one we 
still use.  The year was still 1582 when he got through with it, but all 
subsequent years started on jan. 1 (new style) instead of march 25 (now called 
'old style')  Various countries addopted the callender reform at various 
times, france in the same year, england in 1752, china in 1912, the soviet 
union in 1917.

jewish personae use the jewish callender in which 1,1 = approx. september 
equinox 3761 b.c. any time.

muslim personae use the muslem callender in which year 1 = 622 a.d.

chinese personae use a calender in which year 1 =  2637 b.c.  until 1912.  I 
suspect that the japanese would use the same callender, but i dont know.

It would of course be nice if non-julian/gregorian using personea appended to 
their year-counts something like "that would be the year x, as the franks 
count it" just so we don't get hopelessly confused

the persians had their own callender, the zoroastrian, from a.d. 225.  I know 
nothing of its year count.  They continued to use it, at least for month
names, even after their conversion to islam in 621 (although not officially)
India also had a callender of it's own starting in 1000 b.c.  It now uses
the gregorian for civil purposes.

I suggested "fraternity" because it is a period term used by guilds
and the like to describe themselves.  Personally, I cannot see
anything offensive in a word which just means "brotherhood", which has
no gender-offensiveness.  (But let's not have that argument, please).
I'm can certainly see that "fraternity" is rife with modern
connotations.  So, how about the Ancient Company of Fishermen?  This
is also a period way of decribing a guild or other group.  And, if we
must go entirely genderless (hmph), how about the Ancient Company of
Fishers?

Message-Id: <Dec.7.21.42.20.1988.286@triumph.rutgers.edu>


Oh, Malice, it gets much worse than that!  Calendar reform was not a
smooth thing at all.  Several popes tried to reform the calendar at
various times in the later Middle Ages, and few succeeded.  Once
calendar reform was promulgated, it wasn't accepted everywhere: The
Protestant countries considered it a Papist abomination, and refused
to listen.  In England, the calendar wasn't reformed until 1752, and
in other parts of Northern Europe, not until even later.  Those of you
with standard UNIX systems might try typing the command "cal 9 1752".

To make matters worse, the change of the date of the New Year was not
universal in most of our period, and many authors simply dated events
"in the third year of the reign of Louis" or "in the fifteenth year of
the abbocy of Thibaut."  To take it one step further, some events are
dated in this fashion: "In the third week of Lent in the year 1412."
The dates of important feasts were not universal either.  

Pity the poor historian.

A brief discussion of these problems may be found in the introduction
to "Gascony: England's First Colony", and Lord Anton Winteroak wrote
an article on calendar reform for TI (I think) a couple years back.

So, it seems that what you are saying is that we can recognize each other
by realizing there is a secret password which neither of us know.

"I see y' wear the mark o' the net!  Do y' know of the secret passworde?"
"Sure'n I do, but have y' heard what it be yet?"

So not knowing the password means we are part of the group. (huh?)  But

I know lots of folk are enjoying the idea, and maybe my sense of humor
is deficient in this area, but I am very bothered with the concept of
a secret society.  Why?  Because I feel a secret society is too exclusive.
We do not (presumably) want to make non net folk feel unwelcome simply 
because they do not have access to the net.  I also don't want to feel that
I should keep the fact that I am on the net a secret (which seems to be
part of being in a "secret society").

Note that I do want to be able to meet other net folk at events, but I want
it to be more open than a secret society.  I personally like the idea of
an academy, since it seems to be very close to what we actually are (except
for the medium of communication, which will always be hopelessy modern).

Maybe I'm taking this all to seriously, or am misinterpreting the concept
of a secret society.  If so, I do apologise, and please correct me gently.

I also may be too sensitive about all this (exclusive groups are a sore subject
with me).

Well anyway, these are my thoughts.

Lord Geoffrey de Shipbrooke writes that there aren't enough court appointments
available, to make giving them a viable alternative to "merit badge" orders &
such. I submit that that merely shows a certain lack of imagination and/or
research. Eastrealm kings used to do this sort of thing occasionally, and I'd
like to see lots more of it. We used to have a "Captain-General of Guatemala"
(take _THAT_, Outlands!). We've had a "Royal Opener of Bottles of the Sea" (a
period Spanish position, I'm told. We've had several Court Fools and Royal
Executioners, of course. But we can have more serious ones. What do you call the
queen's boyfriend (who isn't the King)? My lady and I have decided that if I
were ever in that situation (which is not that improbable, considering her
frequent champion) that I would be "the Queen's Chamberlain". What do you call
the lady who helps the queen get into her farthingales? Why, the "Mistress of
the Robes", of course. And the king has his "Groom of the Stole". The person
who acts as the crown"s secretary? How about the "Protonotary" (EK Curia used
to have one.)
So much for Royal Household appointments, though. This idea should be, (as
others have suggested), expanded so that we have "hereditary" positions, by
which I mean that one "King's Pantler" can appoint the next. What an honor
that would be! This is all within the Crown's gift, and ought to be
encouraged. It's grand and dramatic, it's period, and it's an alternative to
giving out yet another companionship in yet another order.

Hello again. First, to Richard de Lacy (on Scadian/Mundane): Huzzah! I concur
completely. Your "Yankee" analogy is perfect.
Now, as I have said before, the SCA itself needs a persona-name (if not a 
persona). "Scadia" is not a bad one. The fact that it was a pejorative term
from Marlnad, originally, is irrelevant. (I took the title "Firebrand" as a 
Herald Extraordinary because an out-kingdom herald once berated me for being
a firebrand. I decided to turn it into a badge of honor. Then there's the
peeress who bears snails on her arms because someone once called her a slug to
her face -- same reason.) There is also "Mistland", which I've mentioned
before. Arval has advocated a return to "Empire" -- I don't recommend that, at
least, not anywhere near John ap Griffin.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Regarding our award system, yeah, it bears little relation to the Real Middle
Ages, and there are _way_ too many awards, but it's (sigh) too late to change
now. The best we can do is to (thanks, Arval) write recommendation letters.
And...we can also let our royalty and baronage know our philosphies of what
various awards are _for_. Court baronies are a pet example of mine. In the
East, we have what I call the "booby baron" phenomenon. (Okay, okay, I'm a
court baron, myself. You can stop screaming now.) What happens is that a
candidate for a polling order gets an unfavorable response. The Crown wants to
reward him/her anyway, so they make him/her a court barone/ess instead,
(usually with a grant of arms -- which *outranks* the polling order for which
it is the "booby prize"). I have heard it said that a court barony *should* be
for people who have "become institutions in the Realm". Well, if you believe
that, (I do), then let your Crowns know what you believe. They probably *want*
to know what their people think they should be giving awards for -- they
*want* our help! If enough people are vocal that the Order of the Hippo should
be given to persons who meet Criteria Set X, and not to people who meet
Criteria Set Y, then maybe a whole kingdoms's award-system inertia can be
overcome and changed. The SCA is us. The other guy ain't gonna fix it.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
To Malice, alias Capriol: There are times when one (especially if one is a
herald) has to speak within the medieval context, not *to* someone, but *of*
someone. That is why, for example, I favor a persona for the SCA-as-a-whole
and for the BoD. I don't want to have to say "Corporate Publications
Director", for example, and would much rather say, perhaps, "the Lady
Arch-Chronicler". And I'm bloody well not going to call you a feastocrat;
"chief cook" will do fine.
I used this argument, incidentally, to rebut some heralds who favored a total 
"laissez-faire" policy on household names, a few years back. Sure, households
aren't part of the "official" SCA structure, but we often have to refer to
them in "official" contexts and I don't want to have to refer to some members'
"House of Windsor" in court, thank you very much. The point here is that we
should have a medieval alternative for our mundane terms and "club jargon" for
use when we have to refer them in the context of our role-playing.
I remain,

Subject: Semantics, etc...

I am moved to comment. This does not happen as often as people who know me
may think, but my lack of active participation on this net may hold this
out. In any event, I wish to speak on at least two issues:

1) CE vs. AD-
   Common Era is not an unused term, as has been suggested. AD, or as
   literally translated, 'Ano Domini- the year of our lord,' is a
   particularly Christian term. While I have nothing against the followers
   of Jesus (some of my best friends are Christians :-) ), there are
   many of us who are not of this faith who prefer to use the BCE/CE
   denotation instead. It denotes what BC/AD does, without the religious
   connotations. The year, as accepted by common practice is 1988. This
   is the Common Era (perhaps the SCA may be the Un-Common Era?). Live
   with it.

2) Awards-
   With the risk of flogging an already deceased equine (sadism, bestiality,
   and necrophilia?), I want to talk about awards. Yes, the system is flawed.
   What isn't? Churchill once said that Democracy is the worst form of 
   government on all the earth... except for all the rest. The system we've
   got is ours. There is only so much any society of umpteen-thousand people
   can do for fair and timely recognition of awards. Yes, there are people
   I know who are very deserving of awards, who have up until now been denied.
   Circulate a petition!! Yes, they sometimes work! The royalty can't be
   everywhere at once, and must rely on public opinion to help. Stop griping
   and do something. Those who fail to act lose the right to criticise the
   consequences of their inaction.

   Unfortunately, there is also the reverse problem. There are some people
   I have seen in my limited experience and travels that have been awarded
   titles they did not in one way or another deserve. The key question is:
   is there anything we can do about it? If not, then be the best you can
   be, and don't worry about it. If you find something you can do, then
   would you hurt someone by doing it? Is bringing the destruction in the
   Society of one person, or even spreading nasty rumors which can prejudice
   those who don't know the person, the right thing to do if you disagree
   with the award they have been given? Please remember that this is political
   too. Sticking knives in backs may help you this reign, but you will
   lose in the long run when word gets around about the tactics you use. Those
   who cut down their compatriots may seem to rise in comparison, but they
   haven't really risen at all.

2A) Awards, philosophy threof-
    Is an award a status symbol, or a recognition of a job well done?
    I hope I do not offend if I use Knighthood as an example. I was
    always taught that Knighthood means a good fighter, a chivalrous
    person, a well-rounded individual, in short- not just a stick-jock.
    In my mind, striving for the award is antithetical to the philosophy
    of the White Belt. A person is chivalrous because it means being nice
    to people, not to get some spurs. If not, their behavior is selfish
    and un-chivalrous. The award, to me, is being the person. It is not
    a belt, spurs, medal, blazon, title, etc. Those are just symbols of
    who you are. If you have the token but not the qualities, it is an
    empty victory. If you have the qualities, but not the token, you have
    already won.

I hope I haven't gotten myself into too much trouble.
Thanks for the soapbox,

GREAT IDEA!! I really like the idea of a secret society, with passwords and

Also, I would find it helpful to have an idea who to be looking for at
interkingdom events - if people could at least occasionally stick something
in a message to say where they are (kingdom|barony/shire/canton|phys_address)
it would give me some clue.  I'm beginning to catch on to some of the

This practicing Catholic would also feel most uncomfortable seeing an
order dedicated to a Catholic saint (or one dedicated to an Orthodox
saint as well) -- unless the order were, essentially, "the real thing",
with the traditional vows, and not a sham.  And if it were a genuine
religious order, well, it wouldn't be what the contributors here appear
to want, and I wouldn't expect them to join it.

Greetings, my lady!

The idea of the secret society, as I understand it, is not to exclude
anyone, but rather to povide us with a useable identification mark
and to give us a place in our medieval world.  A secret society could
not be discussed publically in an SCA context; it would cause
immediate censure.  Similarly, WE shouldn't talk computers at SCA
events, unless we are certain there is no one around who will object.
By having an unobtrusive mark and a standard "secret" greeting, we
can ensure we won't be bothering anyone with non-period conversation.
Lady Malice's point is well-taken: Even someone who IS a net-poster
might not want to discuss it at an event.

On the other hand, we shouldn't call it a "Secret Society".  I like
the "Society of Fisherman" concept.  What do people think of
"Fraternity of Fisherman"  (Ooh: alliteration!!)

Forget anything I said previously.  Master Kobyashi's secret society
in my opinion, tops any idea I've heard yet.  Now all we need is some
form of agreement on a symbol.  I feel there should be a standard so
everyone can recognize it immediately.  (Anyone in the secret society
that is)  There might be a problem distributing them, but I'll give that
some further thought later.  As to a pass word, that should be determined
but not over the net.  You find it out when you receive your badge.

No, no, Elsbeth!  On the contrary, it's a great ice-breaker.

This is fun.  Don't spoil it by making it prematurely official.  Besides, asking
the Administrator to call for a vote on this subject hardly seems to be the
appropriate way to establish a secret society.

Note:  We can still have a badge, if people so desire, but it must be painted
over, so nobody can make it out.  Does anybody know the proper heraldese for
"... painted over in solid black"?

Subject: Rialto

No doubt this is the n-plus-oneth posting on the subject, but since i
originally suggested the use of the name, i feel obligated to explain
it here.

I took the name from the Merchant of Venice, Act I, Scene iii,
lines 35-36 in the Signet Classic edition.  I had remembered the Rialto
as being a general name for the maritime district, but the aforementioned
book has as its footnote "a famous bridge in Venice, the center of trade
and commerce".  (or something like that.)  Thus by extension it was a
place where people went to gather the latest news of far-flung lands fresh
off the ship.  The quote turns out to be, "What news on the Rialto?",
spoken by Shylock to Bassanio.

Yours for literary references,

No, no, no, Colin.  You miss Master Kobi's point entirely: We should
AVOID offical definition and registration.  The whole idea is to be
relaxed, free-form, and devoid of organization.  furthermore, if we
have a standard badge which everyone uses, how can we stay secret?
It'd be pretty blatant.  His suggestion of "something to do with
communication wrapped in a net" is a perfect solution.  It allows
creativity but still serves for recognition.

AARRGGHH! The popular view here is that legal fictions are solemn
things.
However, whenever one tried to get this through the CoA bureaucracy, I
was
told that anything to do with an alternate persona was a "badge".
(This
is an outstanding example of the attitude "Every form of
identification
has to fit into one of our pigeonholes, so it must be, uh, uh, a
badge!"
which in turn contributed largely to the debasement of badges Arval

of.

NOBODY FOR EMPEROR! Nobody gives us the leadership we need! Nobody has
shown
concern for the whole Society! Nobody can be trusted with power!
  Why, look at the Emperor's record. He never tries to maximize the
in-
cubmency. Never engages in feuds. Never makes unjust accusations.
Never
makes just accusations.
Anyway, if Hungary could get along for 25 years under a "regency" for
a
King who did not exist, what is wrong with an Emperor who does not
exist.
   Indeed, I would suggest borrowing a law from the Corvine Society:
"In-
asmuch as the Emperor is immanent and transcendent, no member may at
any
time deny that he is the Emperor"

Subject: what we are

secret society--i love it!  It has the added advantage that if someone
comes up to mee and says "what news from the Rialto" i can say "I do not
deal with the rabble in the market place" and they will not say "Oh, Malice!
I read your stuff on the net!" if i do not at the time wish to be dragged
into a totally non-period discussion at the time (no offence meant to the 
nice people i met at the war, i was, in fact, very happy to meet you, i just
don't like mixing my media, it gives me a hangover)
Rialto:  A market place [after 'Rialto', an island in Venice on which a 
market place was situated.] from the American Herritage Dictionary.

I think we are more like a faire or market place than we are like anything 
else.  I do not see why the fact that our physical bodies are physically
located in widely sepparated places should be in any way relevant.  The 
major difference is that we are unable to interupt each other and simultanious
conversations do not prevent everyone from hearing what is said... we buy,
sell, barter, argue, gossip, play (word) games, make announcements...

re badge: please, not a lightning bolt.  in fact, no references to electricity
at all.  A net is nice and has perfectly good mundane connotations (where
'mundane' means of THIS world, not the "etherial domains" of the techno-

How about a secret hand shake, too. I know a great one but I'm not telling
'cause then it wouldn't be secret ;-).

I like this because if you are busy or not into talking bits you can give a
wrong answer and  then approch the questioner later when you have the right
attitude. We can also change it from time to time to check out who is really
in "the Siblinghood of the Rialto". :-):-) (Is Brotherhood a sexist term? ;-)

Subject:      Lord of the Dance

(from Stacy Pendell, aka Anastasia Knutovna, aka SMJ@CORNELLA:)

                   The Lord of the Dance

When She danced on the waters and the wind was Her horn,
The Lady laughed and everything was born.
And when She lit the Sun and the light gave Him birth
The Lord of the Dance first appeared on the Earth.

CHORUS:  Dance, dance, wherever you may be:
         For I am the Lord of the Dance, said he.
         I'll live in you if you'll live in me
         And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said he.

I dance in the Circle when the flames leap up high
I dance in fire, and I never, never die.
I dance in the waves on the bright summer sea,
For I am the Lord of the waves' mystery.

I sleep in the kernel, and I dance in the rain:
I dance in the wind and through the waving grain.
And when you cut me down I care nothing for the pain:
In the Spring I'm the Lord of the Dance once again.

I dance at the Sabbat when you dance out the spell,
I dance and sing, let everyone be well.
And when the dancing's over, do not think that I am gone:
To live is to Dance, so I dance on and on.

The Horn of the Lady cast its sound 'cross the plain
The birds took the notes and gave them back again.
'Til the sound of Her music was a song in the sky,
And to that song there's but one reply.

The moon in its phases and the tides of the sea,
The movements of the earth, and the seasons that will be
Are the rhythm of their dancing and a promise through the years
That the Dance goes on through your joys and tears.

They danced in the darkness and they danced in the night,
They danced on the earth, and everything was light
They danced in the darkness and they danced in the dawn
And the day of their dancing still goes on!

I gaze on the heavens and I gaze on the earth
And I hear the pain of dying and rebirth
And I lift my head in sadness, and in praise of the day
Of the Dance of the Lord and the Lady Gay.

I see the maidens laughing as they dance in the sun
And we count the fruits of the harvest, one by one.
And I know the storm is coming, but the grain is all stored
And we sing the praise of the Lady and her Lord.

We dance ever slower as the leaves fall and spin,
And the sound of the horn is the wailing of the wind.
And the call of the hunter as he rides 'cross the plain
While the Lady sleeps 'til the Spring comes again.

The sun is in the southland and the winds they blow chill
And the sound of the horn is fading on the hill.
For the earth is wrapped in stillness and we move in a trance
But we hold on fast to our faith in the Dance.

The sun is in the southland, but the days lengthen fast
And soon we will sing for the winter that is past.
For now we light the candles and rejoice as they burn
And we dance the Dance of the sun's return.

But to be a proper SECRET PASSWORD, we shouldn't bandy it about here
where there may be SPIES, or worms, or even the evil NSA monitors! We
should have a proper SECRET PASSWORD, a password so secret that even
the members of the SECRET SOCIETY merely know of its existance, and not
its actual text! Yes by gum and by golly then we would have a proper
SECRET SOCIETY!

I agree with Robyyan Torr d'Elandris on this one.  Having fought for more than
eight years in everything from moldering carpet armor to articulated samurai
plate to minimal leather armor, I can say that winning tournaments is very
enjoyable.  Winning them because your armor is composed of material that took
a week of rifling the lower reaches of the Boeing Surplus scrapyard for hi-tek
goodies is fun until you realize that you'd be dead because your armor, not your
skill, has been keeping you alive.  It is also not in the spirit (at least for
me 8} ) of the reasons I like to fight.  Go play hockey if you want to hit 
people while you're wearing light plastic/higher tech armor.

At the request of Todd Ellner, the lyrics to the Lord of the Dance.  I
think I managed to remember all the verses but if there are any more I
would like to learn them.  Thanks.

I danced in the morning when the world was begun.
I danced in the moon and the stars and the sun.
I came down from heaven and I danced on the earth.
And at Bethlehem I had my birth. 

Chorus:

Dance, then, wherever you may be
I am the lord of the dance said he
And I'll lead you all wherever you may be
And I'll lead you all in the dance said he.

I danced for the scribes and the pharisees
But they would not dance and they would not follow me
I danced for the fisherman, for James and John,
They came with me and the dance went on.

Chorus

I cured the sick and I healed the lame.
The holy people said it was a shame.
They whipped and they stripped and they hung me high
And left me there on a cross to die.

Chorus

I danced on a Friday and the sky turned black
It's hard to dance with the devil on your back.
They buried my body and they thought I'd gone
But I am the dance and I still go on.

Chorus

They cut me down and I leapt up high!
I am the life that will never never die.
I'll live in you if you'll live in me.
I am the lord of the dance said he.

Chorus

Greetings to all; I also support Master Kobayashi's idea. It seems most
appropriate, requires least effort, allows for considerable creativity, but
most of all, would be a lot of fun. I also like avoiding obviously non-
medieval means of recognizing one another. Perhaps we should be a group of
magicians or wizards of a certain vague kind (i.e., it's not quite clear
what we do, what we CAN do, and what we cannot). Yule greetings to all to

Hello all
I think the idea of a device of some sort to identify kindred netlanders
is a fantastic idea. Secret Society ....I like that. Religous order...Bad
idea.  A piece of netting hanging from a belt sounds quite nice to me.

I find the idea of creating homogenous shires or forcing groups to choose
a groups persona extreamly distaseful....I do not want to be forced to be
an fop simply because the local group has a large number of them, similarly
I would find it revolting to be forced to act like an uncultured boor sim0ply
because of an abundance of celts :-)

Technically, Corpora defines a "riding" as a sub-group of a province. It is to
a province what a canton is to a barony. A march, I believe, is a
shire-equivalent (usually on a kingdom border, but I don't think it's really
required). The East a "_Barony_-March", viz., the Debatable Lands (where
Pennsic is held). Then there are things like "fortresses" (shires at military
establishments) and "ports" (shires that move, like the one on the USS
Nimitz). Carolingia has "boroughs" which are basically "colleges" that haven't
seen the need to become official branches.

The latest issue of "Majesty" magazine had an insert with an interesting ad.
It seems a film was made of the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II on June 2,
1952, and that film has just been made into a video. It's 79 minutes long, in
color, with a narrative written by Christopher Fry and spoken by Sir Laurence
Olivier. It's available in VHS or Beta, for $29.95 + $2 s&h (for up to 4
copies, 50c per ea. additional). Address is:

Subject: Obnoxious Terms

In a recent message Lord Bartholomew the Bewildered expressed his disgust
with the term "Scadian" and suggested "Gentle Folk of the S.C.A." as a
substitute. While SCA jargon ("Low Forsoothlian") is a major concern to me
I must say that in this instance I disagree with Lord Bart. Consider: what
_are_ we, anyway? I mean, what is our group persona? We call our land "the
Known World" but we're less than that: we know of places that are not part of
the "Known World" -- Acre, Markland, the Tuchux Lands, and of course,
Mundania. So, if we're _not_ the only people in the "world as we know it" (the
Knowne Worlde), we must have a name for ourselves. And I submit that what we
are, until someone comes up with something better, is Scadians, that is people
from Scadia, which is what this Confederation of the Twelve Laurel Kingdoms
ought to be called.

Now, actually, someone _has_ come up with a better name. At least _I_ think
so, 'cause the someone is me. It seems that Master Wilhelm von Schlussel
(former Laurel King at Arms) has determined that back when the West was all
there was, they sometimes called themselves "the Kingdom of Mistland", whence
of course, the Principality and the Province of the Mists (SF Bay Area, CA).
Considering that all of the SCA (even the East) derives ultimately from the
early West, that gives us the name "Mistland" as the persona-name of the
Society for Creative Anachronism -- the SCA's own SCA name! And _that_ makes
us all "Mistlanders".

The concept of an SCA-name for the SCA itself, is one that a lot of folk miss.
We _need_ a name for ourselves, as explained above, beyond "the SCA". The
Society for Creative Anachronism is a mundane enitity, of which neither of my
persona-selves (the Welsh baron of 1408 and the Eastern baron of AS XXIII) has
ever heard. "Mistland" or "Scadia" -- now, that's a concept either of my three
persona-selves can understand. I cringe whenever I hear "the SCA" in a formal
court, or have to read "the Society for Creative Anachronism" on a scroll.
That mundanity belongs in Mundania. I would rather stay in persona at a demo
and refer to my companions as fellow "Scadians" than have to break character
and call them fellow "SCA members" or "folk of the Society for Creative
Anachronism".

Subject: More on Bad Words

Actually, you have to consider real vs. percieved meanings. A well-known
fraternal organization to which I belong calls non-members "profane". It
doesn't mean they're obscene, just that they are "pro fanum", which is Latin
for "outside the temple". The head of the local chapter is called "Worshipful"
which doesn't mean we worship him, but that he is worthy of being honored
or "worschipped" as in the English "Your Worship". And then there's the
Vulgate edition of the Bible, which is hardly "vulgar" the way we usually use
the term. And so there is nothing derogatory about "mundane": it merely means
"of the [real] world" from Latin "mundus" for "world". It's equivalent to the
Church's use of the words "secular" or "temporal" as opposed to "spiritual".
We have separated ourselves from the "world" and created an entity which we
fancy is not part of the "real" world (mundus). Anything connected with that
world is "worldly", that is, "mundane".

Subject: if not a guild or order or..., what about an academy?

There seems to be some bureaucratic and etiquette issues involved in the
scanetters becoming a guild.  Why don't we establish something that is out-
side of the current guild structure and be an academy?

Academies started as basically lecture societies for men (and less often
women) of rank or wealth in mid 15th C CE.  The first was the Platonic
Academy of Florence, which was founded to provide a discussion place for
philosophical works which were then being translated from arabic, greek, and 
hebrew--which study was neither forbidden nor condoned by the Church.  "Pagan 
authors," and all that...  

Academies quickly became the intellectual and business clubs for the upper 
crust of the early Rennaisance Italian.  Some academies became fronts for 
secret societies--political or occult movements.  The academies developed 
badges (sorry! don't have my source books here--there's a particular name for 
this but I forget what it is...) that were most often an animal from the crest 
of their native city, although, for instance, the pelican and other heraldic 
creatures (mostly natural ones) were used for their symbolic meaning.

Perhaps we should use an academic badge of a dolphin (the fish, not the 
mammal) backed by netting, or some similar thing.  There may be some way to 
differentiate this from guild symbology that would be useful.

Actually, The Lord of the Dance was/is a Christian hymn originally.  
I'm afraid I don't remember many of the words, but the chorus is the
same as the pagan version; same tune as the (older?) Simple Gifts.
Of the little bit I recall :

(Forgot this line)
It's hard to dance with the Devil on your back.
I danced for the fishermen James and John.
They came with Me and the Dance went on.

Well they cut Me down
And they hung Me high
But I am the Light that will never never die.
I live in you and you live in Me.
I am the Lord of the Dance, said He.

Beautiful hymn in any of its three versions.  Could someone who knows
either of the Lord of the Dance versions post the whole thing?

Not too mention in Asia.  For Lediterranean piracy one would probably do well
to adopt a North Afr`can presona, 'the Halls of Tripoli', 'Barbary Pirates',
and all that stuff.  Or adopt a conquistador persona.  The native a`counts
of the Portugese and Spanish explorers (the ones the Spanish and Portugese
didn't manage to burn that is) universally describe them as uncultured,
uncivhlized, cowardly pirates.  The Phliphno accounts of Magellan, for instance.

Well we are not a university -- I am *not* in school :-)  At least I get a
better salery than I did when I was... or what I would get as a prof! :-)

We are not a convent -- I do not bow down to the computer!  Well, period or 
not I do not like to be part of a christian order... the idea just sticks in
my throat (no I am not christian).

There are no rides, or jugglers, or... this is no faire...

The only clash here is of witts, not armies...

-Wearing the favor of a household -- like the Pennsic pilgram favors is 
appropriate...  I consider the "mark" on the favor "could" be a badge.
In some ways we are a familly... we hardly ever agree... and nobody has
the last word... but dad might think he has :-)
	but if we consider ourselves a household -- there is household
heraldry (ie: silverwing) -- and where should we petition to have a recognized
household charter?  

-GUILDs don't sit around and "talk"?  In general that is one of their major
functions... that our purpose is "limited" to communications does not say to
*me* that we are not a guild... our requirements are the -very mundane- need
to be attached to this electronic medium and to *want* to be part of our guild
(and not all sca-net folk need to consider themselves part of this "guild");
except for a mundane restriction -- I not see that we aren't a guild in a
"society" sense.  (Now if you want to argue period: I could stretch an argu-
ment to fit... but then a lot of SCA guilds are not strictly period)...  again
we run into the question -- should we be a chartered guild?  where?

All in all heraldry seems appropriate to whatever we want to call ourselves...
and it would be nice to meet a lot of you... 

[as to that: I hope to be travelling more and more in the next year... I will
try to contact local people before said travels... and hopefully will get to 
meet many of the people who are associated with the net!]

We think that's a wonderful idea. Maybe someone can develop a logo in
postscript or pic code which can be easily printed on document
headers to go along with painted or drawn logo. How about a quill
crossed with a lightning bolt or a large arched quill over the world
( blue & green circle ). I ( Michel ) would be interested in doing a
couple of rough photocopiable logos if a consensus could be reached.

Subject: Collective Entity Identity

(please intersperse the following with a liberal dose of smiley faces)

No, no, no!  The model we want is not a guild, or a university, or a
monastic order.  We want to be a SECRET SOCIETY!  Think of it.  We
communicate by an inexplicable means, the mere *mention* of which brings
censure in SCA context.  (or should, but that's a *different* flame.)
Most of us don't even know what the rest look like, and our coin is
information, which we can spread to the far-flung reaches of the Knowne
World with unimaginable speed.  No one knows who we are, and no one can
tell just by looking...(dramatic organ chords in background).

We should definitely have a way of recognizing each other, but it should
be a general class of thing rather than a specific badge or device.  The
net over the tent is the right idea.  Say we agree that our recognition
sign will be anything having to do with communication wrapped in netting.
One person could have a net bag containing a bottle of ink, or bits of
paper, or the like.  You get the idea.  I'm sure the perverse and pun-
inclined among you can come up with some general objects and juxtapositions
that will serve.

This is *not* sufficient, however.  To go along with this, and in keeping
with the spirit, we also need a SECRET PASSWORD.  Having spotted what
might be paper in a net bag, or what might be someone policing the site,
one would walk up and ask, "What news of the Rialto?"  To which the reply
might be, "Have we perhaps not conversed by unspoken means?"  Again, you
get the idea.  (Note: we should *not* use quotes from Shakespeare, or
anyone else.  There is a high likelyhood of someone simply knowing the
quote and parroting it.  Read "Highland Laddie Gone" for an amusing
example.)

These techniques would allow us to get in touch with each other, but still
maintain some semblance of SCA context.  The pilgrim's badge would serve
the same purpose just as well, though distribution becomes a problem 
(people who "should" have them but can't get them, and people who "shouldn't"
have them but buy them anyway because they're fun.)  I think we will
need a password or pass-phrase in any case, just to avoid using computerese.

My half-nybble's worth.

Subject: a "pirate" update

     This will be the third time I've tried to send this message--sorry
if it's the third time you've recieved it.  The ECS system here at UMass
is undergoing its end-of-semester crunch.
     Anyway, as to the response to my previous query about period piracy
I chose the word 'pirate' with some reservations, due to the awful
Hollywood associations with the word.  I believe an equally acceptable
term is "corsair," from the Provencal word 'corsari' meaning a type of
cruising boat.  It was first used to refer to the boats the pirates of
the Middle-East used, but was later used as a polite term for the people
inside.
     And as for the parrot on the shoulder, yech!  I wouldn't want to
take a chance on ruining my garb--("That's Dylyn over there, the one with
bird guano on his shoulder...").
     I was successful in my search for sources, though.  Shortly after
I posted my note to the net, I found a book on Breton maritime history.
Unfortunately, like most books on Brittany, it is in French, which slows
me down a mite.  My French is only good enough to get me through half
a paragraph before I need the dictionary.  For anyone interested, the
book is "Quand les Bretons Peuplaient les Mers," by Irene Pohon.  As
it turns out, the Bretons have a long history of piracy; the city of
Saint-Malo on the north coast was basically a city built around piracy.
I just knew it--being fellow Celts, they just couldn't resist the lure
of easy wealth and fame.
    So rest assured, Arval, when I do become a corsair, it will be
completely period.
    I am a little curious as to how one handles an alternate persona,
as far as awards, names, and titles are concerned.  Does anyone else
on the net have more than one active persona?

Ooooh, what a great idea!

Greetings Kobayashi-sama!  I love it.  It allows recognition, avoids
arguments over "What are we really?", makes a neat end-run around the
problem of registering a badge, and allows for individual creativity.
Let it be so.  Hmmm...what odd ideas come to mind!

Greetings gentles.

Up until now I have been a silent observer on the net.  I have enjoyed greatly
the debates, information and humorous tidbits I've picked up.  I've met and
heard about many people through this net and would be interested in meeting
many of you in person.  But as we all know this is hard to do, so I figured
I would throw in my two coppers on the debate about a net badge or whatever
technical term you would like to use.  I see no need for a registered device
seeing as the net itself is most decidedly un-period, but a non-offensive
symbol of some kind to either be worn or displayed at a meeting point I feel
is an exceptional idea.  I know that the problem with the preceeding sentance
is the word "non-offensive".  There will always be someone who will object.
The definition of "non-offensive" I will leave to heralds and others.  I
would just like to see this idea come into being as a great way to meet new
people.

P.S. Robert of Ferness-- if it won't get you in any trouble, I'd love a copy
of Beowabbit.  But if there is any doubt don't worry.

As far as I have been able to find out, this is the case.  The mass of the helm
is a major safety factor.  Also, fiberglass and most other plastics will
split or shatter under the repeated impacts that the average SCA helm has
to take.  The current E.K. minimum is 16 gauge STEEL (accept no substitutes)

'Nother New Topic:  Persona Sketch:
I am a somewhat split personality.  When I first joined the
society I was very into the High Middle Ages, and my own welsh
heritage, and developed a late 14th C welsh persona. Kyrsteen
ap Senann, being of noble decent, born within sight of Caernarvon
castle, fostered in Northumbria (because I had a hell of a time
finding information about wales) and married to a frenchman (so
I could get away with wearing all the french style gowns which
I like so much.) This persona was me for a number of years.
But as I did more research, I discovered a most facinatingceltic
history of wales, and finding houpelandes and other cumbersome
attire getting to be a hassle at tourneys, anew Kyrsteen began 
to develop for tourneys (I use the same name, and call myself myne
own ancestor...what a time warp!)
Now recently I have been reading about this interesting group of
young italian renaissance noble daughters who went to university
and became somewhat of an interesting social group...and the italian
gowns are so gorgious...perhaps I shall become yet another 
incarnation (the italian translation being Christina perhaps?)
 
Best wishes for the hollidays, hope to see some of you at 12th
Night,
Kyrsteen/kyrwstwn/Christina

"The Marshal's Handbook", (c) 1985, Appendix 3 "Armor and Weapons
Standards", (pg 29) states:
1 Helms:
  a. Helms shall be constructed of _steel_ of no less than 16 guage, or of
     _equivilent_ material. Be aware that steel of less than .0625" (1/16"
     or 1.6mm) is too thin,even if it is sold as 16 guage. (Note also that
     the MASS of the helm is an important part of the protection. Beware of
     titanium, fiberglass, or other ultra-light materials.)

- end quote-

The _underline_ above was me, the CAPS were the Society Marshals empasis.
This is society wide unless covered by more stringent kingdom law. My copy
of East Laws has walked off, so I forget what, if anything, is said about
helms.

I was trying to discourage something dangerous _as_ an East Kingdom Marshal.

On the contrary, my lord, I feel that since, (at least in the Kingdom
of the West; I cannot speak for the more backward^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hfar
flung kingdoms...) religious intolerance is not tolerated, there is no
need to "feign allegiance" to preserve health.  Therefore, there is no 
reason  NOT to object, and I am fairly sure that those of my acquaintance 
of the pagan persuasion would object in no uncertain terms.  Even though
I am a (nominal) follower of the Church of Rome I cannot blame them.  I 
wouldn't want to be forced to wear a Thor's Hammer either.

I just spoke with Bruce Blackistone by telephone last night (December 1)

Beowabbit.  He is annoyed, but doesn't intend to sue anyone. He has
however, asked me to pass along his request that everyone cease and
desist any further distribution of electronic copies.

Since the copies currently in circulation have been made without his
permission, under the strictest interpretation of copyright law anyone
who has one is supposed to delete it. Since I don't believe for a
minute that anyone who has a copy is really going to do this, would you
at least append the notice:

If you wish to obtain a 'legitimate' copy, you can order one for $3.00
plus $0.50 postage from:

It's quite likely that you might wangle a discount if you buy them in
bulk, so I'd suggest that the more enterprising among you buy a dozen
or so copies and re-sell them at events.

A minor footnote: The published version includes a facsimile of the
first page of the original runic document containing the text of

There's also a filk/pagan version of this song -- here's the first
verse:

When she danced on the water and the wind was her horn,
Then the Lady laughed and everything was born,
When She lit the sun and the light gave Him birth, 
Then the Lord of the Dance first appeared on the Earth.

Chorus:
Dance, dance, wherever you may be,
I am the lord of the dance said he,
and I live in you, and you live in me,
and I'll lead you all in the dance said he.

(it goes on for many more verses, most of which I only half remember,
but I've got it written down if anyone wants a copy.)

You are very close, my lord.  The standard blazon for this division in
SCA blazonry is "Per pall inverted sable, argent, and azure."  This
division is very uncommon in period armory, but is considered
acceptable in SCA armory.  However, since it is a fairly complex
division, it cannot be charged in overly complex ways.  In particular,
it is not acceptable to charge each tierce with a different charge.
That design would be considered too complex to be compatible with
period armory.  The best way to use this field would be to charge all
three parts with identical charges, to charge the top parts with
identical charges and perhaps have a different one in the bottom, or
to have some simple charge over the whole field.

> Also, one of the charges has been described as a 'mullet of eight with
> cardinal points elongated'. Is this a proper description?

What you describe is what SCA heraldry calls "a compass star."  It is
a mullet of eight points with 4 greater points in cross and four
lesser points in saltire.  It is not a period heraldic charge, but is
commonly used in SCA heraldry.

There's been a lot of discussion about a badge for the net - I really
like the idea of us as a university.  As I recall the university in
medieval times, they were collections of scholars that gathered in
one location to communicate and share knowledge - and party a lot.
We're in a virtual location to communicate and share knowledge.

How about students' robes?  Or caps or scarves for those persona who
precede such robes?  Anyone know of any other period identification for
students or lecturers at a university?

I don't know very much about Society universities.  Would this kind
of identification step on any toes?

My lord (Syr Aldric Northmark) has a similar star on his device. His star
has wavy arms (not heraldically wavy, but physically wavy) and has been
blazoned for about 15 years as a "estoille of eight points".
The points alternate in length, as Arval describes.

Subject: making connections with personae

Someone commented recently on the absurdity of the anachronisms common
in Society geographical divisions, such as the odd persona combinations 
of local officers.  I'm sorry, I've deleted the digest containing that
message.  Anyway, the writer suggested that divisions based on persona
would be more coherent, and give a better sense of identity.  I like the
idea, but agree with the writer that it would be a difficult change to
implement and perhaps even practice.

However, wouldn't it be neat if we could encourage that sort of group
identity less formally?  For example, there are a number of households
in the Society.  Over time, the people in those houses have moved to 
different geographical areas, and have become subjects of other kingdoms
or baronies, etc., but they have retained their identity and membership
in the household.

I'm getting a little long-winded in this proposal - I'll cut the 
explanations and philosophy short (for this message, anyway), and move
on to my real point ... which is - I would like to find out more about
the persona behind the names on the net.  That identification is more
important to me than the geographic identity, Society or mundane (no
flames on phraseology, please).

In particular, are there any Scots out there from just north of Glasgow
(about the middle of the west side of Scotland) in the mid-13th to
mid-14th century?  You are the people I would be most likely to be
associated with.  I have also traveled in England, Wales and France,
and might presumably have met any residents or similar travelers.
Please respond with details of who you are (persona), and where we
might have met, as well as where you reside in Society terms.

This could be fun!  Is any one else interested in doing this?

Subject: Badge for the SCAnet/Etherial Domains

A Badge...  hmm: didn't we talk about this prior to Pennsic?  Well, no matter
after thinking about it... its a good idea.

To deal with Arval's worries: this will be a badge of a guild.  That guild
is the Guild of Etherial Domains... you are a member if you consider your-
self to be one... You do not **WEAR** this badge, but may display the badge
at guild meetings.

The guild-master, well, by default I guess is me (any objections?) and as
such, I should submit the badge. (I am not sure if there is any heraldric
precidence around what authority the guild master had over the guild's 
heraldry -- could the master display the heraldry as if were his own? could
the master give leave to have another person(s) conflict? et cetera -- just
curious about the history, not SCA-rules)

As to the emblazon: I am a lousy book herald, but: netted (canted/tilted?
I just hate horizontal/vertical stuff) with a quill (and a lightening bolt?)
as the charges....

**ARVAL** are you coming to EKU?  If so, let us get together there and come
up with an emblazon... and then check conflicts, or work with the Carolingian
Heralds for the conflict check...

Any other thoughts from heralds out there - what do you think?

------------------------------------------------------------------
Another Heraldry thought: could we review submissions(sp?) on-line...
or would that run into "confidentiality" problems?

Subject: badge

It seems my usage of Shire has put off Arval, and Arval's usage of 'the 
Order of some saint' has put others off.  I would prefer that the
identity of this gatherum be a seperate issue.  As badges are tied
closely to identity, I think a different tack is in order.  Arval
writes:

Did the Champagne Fair have a badge for everyone who attended?

This gave me an idea.  Whereas I've seen no documentation on this sort
of thing for medieval fairs, the Pennsic War does have pilgrim's badges.
I don't know who makes them, but I bought one because I thought it was
cool.  My lord sews his onto a leather favor on which he also keeps
danglies for various awards that would choke him to death if he wore
them all around his neck.  Now, if I went to the Estrella War (which I
will), and saw an unkown gentle wearing what was obviously a Pennsic
pilgrim's badge, I would quite probably attempt to strike up a
conversation.  This is the idea.  If we come up with some recognizable 
design, those who wish to wear it can do so in hopes that another may
recognize it and introduce themselves.  This does not have to be
registered; it doesn't even have to be blazonable; the Pennsic badges
aren't.  I just happen to like heraldry.  I never meant to imply that 
we are a shire, a household, or that we all eat toast for breakfast.   :-)
I Don't think we should try to fit ourselves into whatever pigeonhole
is period.  I doubt that there will be a consensus on identity.  

Drat it, I just want to be able to *find* some of you people.  A
pilgrim's badge that you don't have to go anywhere for is probably not 
period, but I think it is a reasonable solution.  I only wanted to 
register the silly thing so that somebody who has never heard of this 
forum doesn't register it for himself and paint it on a shield.  Heck,
we could hang little bits of netting off our belts, as long as most of
us agree to it.  Maybe tie a shell up in webbing.  As for heraldic
ideas, i've received the following suggestions:

 From aluko@portia.stanford.edu   (Juls Siwaldsen):
For various reasons, the following charges (taken from the PicDic)
might be appropriate:
abacus, beacon, carrier pigeon, fret, gateway, knot, net, shell.

 from Jim Bolland <sun!sunfun.eta.com!jbolland>
	I have a suggestion.  Have you seen the symbol used by the postal
services in Europe?  It is a simple horn (something like a French Horn).
The horn is gold on a blue background.  A variation on this would be
appropriate as relatively 'Period' and has the benefit of being a
good universal symbol of 'the messenger'.

	Another idea would be to dig back into Greek/Roman mythology and
use a variant of Herme's winged shoes - possibly adding lightning bolts
to portray the electronics involved.

I am slightly alarmed at the suggestion that this badge  that doesn't 
even exist yet should be restricted.  This is not a shire or barony,
whose arms should not be personally used.

This is true.  Badge *registration* has nothing to do with the Middle
Ages.  Did Henry Plantagenet go to the heralds and register his sprig
of broom?  

The 'netted' idea seems to have a lot of support, and it would indeed
be easy to drape some netting in a gathering spot.  Thank you,
Kwelland-Njal, that may be the best idea I've heard yet.

Greetings!

My lady Coranna, I like your idea of something equivalent to a
pilgrim's badge.  It fits well.  I doubt period Fairs ever had any
such thing, but all the major pilgrimage shrines (the medieval
equivalent of tourist traps!) did, and it is a nice, innocuous sort of
display.  And, as you note, there is no reason to register it!

Many of the ideas you received and posted are excellent: A winged
sandal for Hermes appeals to me, and I also like the abacus.  There
are several heraldic charges which approximate a gateway; the most
common one is the portcullis.  The combination of one of these charges
with netting might be just the trick, and it would be fairly simple to
register, I think.

Shall we put together a list of four or five concrete suggestions and
choose one?

	Arval.

Since most period pagans spent their time feigning allegiance to the Church
of Rome, in the hopes of avoiding death in any one of many unpleasant ways,
I doubt that the pagans would object to wearing a fake saints badge. On
the other hand I would expect the stauch supporters of the Church of Rome
to object to anyone making a mockery of a saints medallion.

   Can a marshal give an opinion here?  I thought that lightweight high-tech
materials including fiberglass, other plastics, titanium, etc were banned from
use as helmet material (at least in the East Kingdom) on the grounds that
the shee mass of a steel helmet was a major safety factor - preventing the
usage of the neck as a golf tee.  Is this not the case?

While I could look it up... my memory of the copywrite law inicates that
indeed you have broken various laws by distributing the "text in question"
without the author's copywrite notice or even his name.  Since you did so
without knowledge and at no profit to yourself your liability is limited.  
The laws surrounding electronic distribution are still somewhat fuzzy, but 
I think they are clear enough to make a crediable case against you.
More important is your attempt to right the wrong that has been done.  The
author would have to press charges at this point... and my guess is that
he would have to show financial harm to hit you with anything more than
a slap on the wrist -- this of course is just a laymen's opinion and should
not be construed as a true legal opinion...  My suggestion is that you contact
the author and ask for the right to distribute his work electronically (get it

     I disagree.  The majority of the people involved with the SCA are non-
members, so when people come to our events from other groups, they're as
much a part of the 'known world' as many of those who also attend barony/
shire/canton meetings, fighting practice, etc. in some SCA group.  The way
I see it, 'known world' means anything which it is appropriate to talk
about in persona.

     Imperialism doesn't make me sneeze, but it seems to me that our 12
semi-independent kingdoms don't quite add up to an empire.  If they do,
who's the emperor?
     Besides, I think that we have more pressing identity problems.  Why,
for instance, is it okay for a shire with a Norse name to have a Moorish
seneschal, an Elizabethan marshal, a Byzantine herald, a Dark Ages Celt
chronicler, and a Russian chancellor of the exchequer?  Maybe we could
find some way of grouping people according to both geography and persona.
The geographical groupings could be used for organizational purposes,
while the persona groupings would be referred to in persona.  The persona
groupings might put some people into groups which they rarely come into
contact with, but at least they would lend a semblance of realism to our
society.  And besides, I think that anyone who is serious about their
persona would be glad of the opportunity to meet and associate with other
people with similar personae, and would go out of their way to get together
with such a group.  Unfortunately, such a re-organization would have the
short-term effect of disorienting the many people who are accustomed to the
currently existing 'known world' geography.
     As a more limited form of the above idea, why don't we have each local
group decide on a specific group persona, which would not necessarily apply
to every member, but which could provide people from neighboring groups
with something their personae could identify with.  Thus, a Viking in a
Renaissance Italian group could claim citizenship in a nearby Viking group
while continuing to participate in the organization of the local group.

     I have to agree.  We probably ought to agree to restrict our use of
this badge to specific purposes and contexts.  For instance, maybe it
should only be used to mark a place for all netters to get together (thus
preventing personal usage).

     Instead of eunuchs, how about a net strung between two yew trees?
Or gnus being caught in a net?  Then there are a couple of typos which
I encountered recently: 'newtnews' and 'netnewds.'  Netnewts, anyone?
     Another idea: a red octagon, and a laughing pig with the letter 's'
inscribed on it.  Let's see if anyone can figure that one out.

Just a friendly warning.  Atilla (mka Bruce Blackstone) holds the copyright
on Beowabbit.  While I don't think that he would mind a few copies being
passed around the net, be aware that Beowabbit is *not* public domain.

A couple of years ago at Pennsic somebody was selling copies of
Beowabbit "by Anonymous".  They ended up getting sued.

I would like to make a few corrections and additions to Joshua's
statements.  He is correct that the King and Queen of the West reign
for only 4 months, however the Prince and Princess of each of the
4 Principalities reign for 6 months.

Also, there is another type of group on the local scale.  That is the
Province.  It is of roughly equal size as a Barony, but has no local
royalty.  Since Joshua did not mention it, it is my guess that the
Province is common mainly to the West Kingdom.  Perhaps since there
are 4 principalities in the West, we have less need for Barons to
bring courts and royalty to all the populace?  (Although there are
several Baronies in the West as well.)

Just my 2 coppers worth from someone who still hasn't regestered a
name.  Maybe Coranna can correct me if I'm wrong.

This was left in 'cause it needs to be repeated loudly and often. The
standard is _CHAIN_ and _LEATHER_. I sometimes wish wearing that armour for
a significant amount of time were required. That is where my concept of
disabling blows come from. If I can put a fighter wearing chain and leather
on the ground with a 1.5 inch wide stick (it was an accident), I expect most
novices could do it with a 1.5mm wide sword. 
> 
> [More good stuff and signature deleted]

Now I'm gonna give you my take. For Wisby plate and some types of scale,
plastic is acceptible. I'm not talking high tech guanno here, I mean those
blue and black medium hard ~.25 inch thick barrels. This stuff has simmilar
qualities and limitations as Cuire boilee and is as accesible (in NJ) as
leather was in 13th Century Europe. Covered in cloth or leather and it is
not even an eye-sore.

On the more high tech stuff, I'm ambivilent mostly. Where I do have an
oppinion is kydex for armour. In a word: Don't. Especially for a (shudder!)
helm. This stuff is not sutable for long term use, ask some of the folks
from Andlecraig, especially the one who had a breast-plate break in a melee.
The optimum temperature window is about 60-100 degrees F. Too long an
exposure, or frequent exposure, to cold will increase the brittleness. Too
warm and the wearer goes squish when you hit them. Failure of the piece is
usually unexpected, since fatiguing is hard to detect.

Kydex can be neeto in that it can be shaped at low heat easily. There was a
man who fought in full Tudor kydex. Looked odd, but good. He gave it up when
it became unreliable, after about 2 years. I have also heard of the Atenvelt
quick kydex elbow: rivet a strap on a peice, leave it in the sun for 20
minutes, strap it on over a pad, put in the shade to cool, and, hey presto,
an elbow cop.

Other points on kydex:
      1 The MK Earl Marshal 10 years ago (Finvar) ruled it could only be
	used for a year in armor, then the piece should be replaced. This
	was not a grandfather clause, just a safety ruling. The armor
	failure was awfully public, rather spectaular, and quite frightening.

      2 As of 5 or 6 years ago it was illegal in Ansteora. It was an
	Ansteoran who made the "Squish when you hit 'em" comment.
	I have no idea if this or point 1 are still on the books.

      3 Kydex is light. Normally this is an advantage, but not for a helm.
	If the helm doesn't absorb the energy, something else will have to.
	Since most of us don't like too much play from oversoft padding, nor
	do we have the money/technology of pro football to use the gel pads,
	the most likely canidates for absorbing the force of the blow are
	the brain and spine. This is a suboptimal solution to me. Sounds

Well, enough of this. I now step down off of MY soapbox and go back to work.

THE RETURN OF THE SATED SULTAN
Barony of Concordia of the Snows

We, most humble and ever faithful servants of our Master, have the great joy
to bring you a message from the Grand and Glorious Sultan Abdul.  On Saturday,
February 4, A.S. XXIII (C.E. 1989), his mighty caravan will again be passing

his last sojourn here, that he has commanded us, his lowly servants, Lady Karima
and Lord Sirhan al Cyani (Diablu) along with our wretched and most unworthy 
children Selim and Besma, to invite you all, Faithful and Infidel alike, to
partake in the most splendid and delectable feast ever.  Our Hugely Hedonistic
Highness must never be surrounded by less than the greatest luxury, we bid you 
therefore, to bring with you carpets, and cushions upon which to recline 
throughout the day's festivities.  (The Western abominations known as 
"tables and chairs" will be banned in the hall lest they offend our most
Sublime and superfluous Sultan's eye.)  Our Generous Sultan will award riches
to those guests whose furnishings most please his eye, to the dancers (both 
male and female) whose dancing most delights his eye, and to the storyteller
who spins the most amusing tale.  Our Wise and Wily Master will again
dispense justice for any guest who has been aggrived with the insight and 
wisdom for which he has become renowned.  As a True Believer, our Magnificant
Ruler cannot, of course, condone the consumption of alcoholic beverages in his
hall except for medicinal purposes.  Therefore, any guest wishing to bring wine,
mead or ale to the feast, must present to the Sultan's Physicians a description
of the ailment which requires such medication.  Since our beneficent Lord has
great concern for the well-being of his guests, he will bestow upon the poor
sufferers, deemed by his worthy physicians to be most in need, a generous
quantity of the purely medicinal "Bride Price".  (Bribes to the Physicians
are encouraged and expected and will be used to further the science and skill
of their profession.)  Our Noble Sultan has asked his guests to contribute the 
small sum of 10 Tygers.  You may send your fee , made payable to
SCA-Barony of Concordia to Lady Karima al Cyani, c/o Anne R. Martens, 10 Colonie
Aev., Latham, NY, 12110 no later than January 25.  Please enclose a SASE so we 
may direct your caravan to the Sultan's great hall.  We most humbly beg and 
beseech you, our Mighty Master's honored guests, to tell us how we may add to 
your comfort and enjoyment, lest we should fail to please, and our Supreme and
Superlative Lord be filled with righteous wrath against his inglorious servants;
 you may call us at farspeaker # 518-785-3478 before 10pm.

My lords and ladies,
While I do not frequently post to the net, I feel I must make my
feelings known.
While I love the idea of a netnews badge, I am leary of associating
the order with a religious order.  As an orthodox Jew (both
in persona and reality), I would feel most uncomfortable in an
order dedicated to a Catholic Saint.  I imagine thatmany Pagans
out there would feel the same way.
Instead, I agree with the suggestion that we refer to usneters
as members of a college or university, or even a school of
philosophy.

Subject: greetings and goodbye

Greetings to all yo wonderfll people I have been reading
from the last couple of months. I may have to say good-
bye until I gt a computer with a modem at home, as I have
discovered that next term I will be unable to send (I don't
know about recieve) e-mail off campus. 
For that I should like to get my last to bits in bfore I
am silenced:
Way back when we were on the topic of fighting with longer
than sword-type weapons, there was a discussion about terms.
It seems to me that interkingdom discssions really need to
have terms clarified, as they are not unversal in the SCA.
When I said 'polearm', I meant just that.  A weapon on a long
stick. A generic term, as it were. 'Pike', on the other hand
meant a long pointy pole, no blade, no length restriction.
In An Tir, the bladed (slashing) weapons are restricted to
71/2 feet (around 2m). The use of the above two types is
different in a couple of ways as I see it. Bladed polearms
can be used rather effectively in single combat (a lot like
oriental staff fighting except that you have to watch where
yor blade is). Pikes on the other hand are generally kind
of silly in single combat as far as I can tell. Bt they
are very usefull in group combat (ie wars, one of my 
favorite passtimes), and without face thrusts, most of the
available targets would be gone.
On Dance: I am a fast learner I suppose, but I rarely go
to dance practices, yet I have no problem most of the time
in following along with the steps of new dances after a a 
quick walk throgh, and don't mind the qick walk throughs
on dances I know anyway. I find that if you pair people
who don't know the dance well with those who do, that it
goes quite well, and everyone seems to have a good time (We
tend to teach for the first set, then just guide people in
later sets in Lionsgate)
Paid Membership: I am a paid up member because I am a
baronial officer and it is reqired of me, but I probably
would be anyway. However, there are several of my friens
who are very broke, and can't afford it. I share my criers
and TIs with them, and I do this because I find that a 
person's financial capacity very seldom reflects thier
commitment or the time they donate to the events they
attend.  I know several peopl who consistently volunteer
for the kitchens, troll booths, clean up squads, or as
constables for the wee small hors when the rest of us are
all asleep.  I think that contribtions of time are as
valable (if not more so) than monetary contribtions to
the SCA as an organisation.
 
Thanks so much, and it may be possible to continue to get
mail if I can not sent it. In any case, I can be reached
throgh Elizabeth Braidwood, and may contine to keep in
touch through her.
In service, best wishes, and happy hollidays,
Kyrsteen ap Senann

Good Heralds:

   I require assistance on a blazon. My device is not of a common 
tiercing. The divison of the device is as follows:


                      +-----------------------+
                      |           |           |

                          \ /           \ /
                           \             /
                            \_         _/
                              \_     _/
                                \___/ 

The upper left field is sable, the upper right argent, and the lower
azure.         

The closest I've seen is 'tierced per pairle, reversed' or 'tierced per
pall, reversed'.

Also, one of the charges has been described as a 'mullet of eight with
cardinal points elongated'. Is this a proper description?

Your most learned advice would be most appreciated.

To you perhaps $20 is not significant.  To others it most definately
is.  Events are simply not that expensive;  you need to pay for the
transportation (usually very inexpensive, as events here in the West
tend to be close to home, and carpools very easy to organize) and the
event fee, which also tends to be very low.  Food you'd buy and eat
whereever you happen to be.  Garb can also be very inexpensive.  Armor
can be borrowed, or bartered for.  We shouldn't prevent people from
participating if they can't afford to pay for a membership.

Greetings!

I  highly recommend  Maurice  Keen's  book "The   Outlaws  of Medieval
Legend", published in a revised paperback edition in 1987 by Routledge
& Kegan  Paul,  London.  The  book investigates  outlaw   ballads  and
stoires   in  medieval  literature,    and examines    the  historical
backgrounds  of the individual outlaws and   of their times.  The main
focus of the work is on the Robin Hood  legend, but it also deals with
hereward the  Wake,   Eustace the Monk,   William   Wallace, and other
originally historical outlaws.  Keen considers the  social reasons for
the  development  & popularity  of  the  genre, and presents  evidence
relating to the historical origins of the Robin Hood stories.  I found
the book most readable, and most enjoyable.

Can  anyone  point  me  to other   scholarly  works  on  this subject,
particularly  texts and/or translations   of  the original ballads?  I
would be most grateful for any references.

	Arval.

i have as yet no opinion on whether this ethereal assemblage should register
a badge, so i will voice none. however, i do have a few comments in response
to Brigantia's message:
						   ... We could all be
    Hermetian monks (sworn to poverty, in my case!), and Dagonell could be
    our Father Superior! 
surely you mean instead Lord Danulf Donaldson, our hard-working list
maintainer and fixer of bad addresses. in this bewilderment of names
(everyone here has at least -three-) it's easy to confound a couple of
similar-looking ones.

    ... There is a treatment of the field called "netted", which basically
    looks like ropes crossing the field vertically and horizontally,
    knotted at the intersections.  One might even use a Eunuch (or two!) as
    a charge, though that's probably going a touch too far....
if we (or someone on our behalf) do get around to submitting a badge, i
think the "netted" idea has a lot of potential -- canting is really useful.
however, i deem eunuchs to be highly inappropriate, on the grounds that the
SCA mailing list, as such, has nothing to do with Unix.  SCA mail is
distributed from MC.LCS.MIT.EDU, which does not and never will run Unix; it
runs ITS, the Incompatible Timesharing System, developed at MIT's Project
MAC in the late 1960s and run here on successive generations on PDP10s
since then.

	In a response to a request for information about pirates, Arval states:

>Later in period, the privateers (better word than pirate; much more
>respectable) became an important part of naval warfare.

	While the word privateer is more respectable than pirate (I suppose it
depends on your veiwpoint), they are not synonyms.  A privateer carried
Letters of Marque issued by some government, which was a license to prey on
shipping of another government, during times of war.  In essence, the
privateer was a member of a civilian auxiliary navy, with the added benefit
of being able to keep the spoils (usually with the government getting its
share).
	A pirate generally sailed with the endorsement of no government
(excluding the occasional period equivalent of a bannana republic), and
preyed on shipping irrespective of its national origin.
  	There were many 'respectable' privateers who never would have been
pirates.  There were, I suspect, a number of pirates who would act as
privateers when the government was being loose with Letters of Marque, and
as pirates at other times.

Greetings!

I will send you a copy of the introduction article, my lady, since I
gather you haven't seen it.  Most of the questions you ask are
well-answered in The Known World Handbook, a publication available
from the SCA Stock Clerk.  However, I am happy to provide a few
details.

The world of the SCA is divided into 12 Kingdoms, each comprising a
chunk of the US, and several including parts of other mundane
countries.  For example, you live in the Middle Kingdom, which is
roughly Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Wisconsin,
Minnesota, and if I missed one I'm sorry, plus central Canada.  I live
in the East Kingdom, which is Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New York,
New Jersey, Delaware, all of New England, eastern Canada and all of
Europe.  A Kingdom is a fully independent area of the Society, with a
minimum of 400 members (usually much more).  A Kingdom is ruled by a
King and Queen, chosen by right of arms in a Crown Tournament.  In
most Kingdoms, Crown Tourney happens every six months, and the victor
(lord or lady) and consort (lady or lord) serve as heirs to the throne
(Crown Prince and Princess) until the end of the current reign, and
then reign as King and Queen for six months.  In the West Kingdom
(central California, Nevada, Alaska, Australia, and various places
around the Pacific), Crown Tourney is held every four months.

A Principality is a semi-independent part of a Kingdom.  It has its
own ruling Prince and Princess, chosen in much the same way as a King
and Queen.  As far as I know, reigns of Princes and Princesses are of
the same duration as those of Kings and Queens.  A Territorial Prince
holds Court and grants titles and rank just as the King, but in a
limited way.  For example, all of Europe in the Principality of
Drachenwald.  The Prince of Drachenwald may grant all awards and
titles which exist in the East except for peerages, the highest
awards.  Often, an area of a Kingdom will become a Principality for
several years and then become an independent Kingdom.

With only one exception, all royalty in the SCA are chosen by right of
arms.  Once someone serves as Royalty, he earns a royal peerage rank:
those who have served as King or Queen once are Counts and Countesses
(or Earls, Jarls, etc), those who have serves as King or Queen twice
or more are Dukes and Duchesses.  Those who have reigned over a
Principality are Viscounts and Viscountesses.  The only exception is
the Dowager Princess of the Kingdom of An Tir (Washington, Oregon,
Idaho, British Columbia), who, after having served as Princess of An
Tir several times before that area became an independent Kingdom, was
awarded permanent royal rank.  She is the only permanent royalty in
the SCA.

On the local scale, there are three basic types of groups: Baronies,
Shires, and Cantons.  A Barony is a large, local group, required to
have at least 25 members, but usually having many more.  It is ruled
by a Landed Baron, who is appointed by the King, with the consent of
the people of the Barony, and rules until he resigns, dies, or is
removed from office.  A Barony is required to be a very active group,
which can support many different activities and can offer help to
neighboring groups.  Within Baronies, there may be smaller groups
called Cantons.  A Canton is somewhat independent from the Barony, but
is supported by it.

A Shire is a local group smaller than a Barony.  It has no ruling
noble, and is usually less active than a Barony.

Within Principalities or Kingdoms, there may be other "unofficial"
divisions.  Some Kingdoms are divided into regions, usually for
administrative purposes.  In some places, several local groups may for
a confederation and act together.

There are as many routes into the SCA as there are members.  The most
common are via fantasy or sci-fi fandom, through role-playing game
groups, and via martial arts.  I suspect most members of the SCA got
started as college students, and in many parts of the Society, college
students and college-based groups form the majority of SCA membership
and branches.  However, the demographics are undoubtedly changing.
Many of the people who joined the SCA as students 5 or 10 or 15 years
ago are still members,  and they are bringing in new friends to join,
and are raising their own families in the SCA.  The membership of the
SCA is still mostly 18 to 30, but that is no longer exclusive. 

I hope this has been helpful.  Welcome, my lady, and good cheer!

	Arval.

Subject: The Celts

There's a six-part series called The Celts playing on BC's Knowledge Network
right now (Sunday evenings at 8pm). In the backgrounds of some of the
scenes are people in appropriate garb doing Celtic-type things (emigrating,
fighting, etc.) In the credits at the end of the show, thanks is given
to the "Dark Ages Society". As the series was done in England, I believe
this society might be based there. Can anyone tell me about this group?
(Got an e-mail address? or even a real-mail address will do.)

Subject: Heraldry for our shire

Master Grendal RedTroll suggested to me in a mail message that we should
develop a device for our electronic shire, or household, or whatever.
If people took to displaying this at interkingdom events we could find 
and meet each other more easily, which is becoming one of my favorite
activities at interkingdom events.  If we want to make this 'official',
perhaps our Esteemed Moderator could have it registered as a badge
(Well, I personally hold Danulf in rather high esteem).  That shouldn't
be difficult, but the various heralds here may be able to suggest a
better way.

Now, as to a device:  Grendal said "telephone poles?"
Eric Foxworthy suggested a spiderweb of eight points with a quill at
each point.  
I would like something fairly easily drawn or painted by someone with
very little artistic skill (me).  Even if we collectively decide not to 
register it, I would like this to look reasonably period, or blazonable,
so I could put up a little banner without spoiling the atmosphere.
That's basically what I personally think is keen, what do the rest of 
you think?  If people mail me suggestions, I will summarize.  

Note:  I don't intend to force this on Danulf (how could I?), I just
think that if anyone is entitled to personally register the device for
this gathering, it is he.  I'll even send in the heralds' fee.  

So, whaddaya think?

Greetings!

I hate to sound like a poop, but I think this sounds like a real bad
idea.  Primarily, I can't see any logic that has anything to do with
the Middle Ages which explains why we have such a badge.  Did the
Champagne Fair have a badge for everyone who attended?  This newsgroup
affords us a wonderful opportunity to discuss all manner of topics,
and I (as you may have guessed) enjoy it.  But it has no more
existence as a household or shire than does the set of people who come
to Kingdom Twelfth Night.  

Medieval badges were worn to show membership in the retinue of a great
lord, allegiance to a certain Crown, membership in an Order of
Knighthood, or devotion to a certain saint.  They were used, in fact,
to show ownership, whether of retainers by a lord or of worshippers by
a saint.  They were not used like biker patches or club membership
decals.  The members of a guild might all use a common badge, but it
was to identify them as part of the guild, and so subject to the
guild's laws and protection, not simply to advertise their
association.  Most badge usage in the SCA has very little to do with
the Middle Ages, and I would be disappointed to see yet another
such usage promoted here.

However.  

If we do decide to consider ourselves as some sort of group, I think
we must first think about how we can fit best into the medieval
atmosphere of the SCA.  One possibility, mentioned before by 
others, is to call ourselves a University, which makes a certain
amount of sense since we are a gathering of scholars from far and
wide (Well, after a fact!).  Another possibility is to style ourselves
the Order of some saint.  We could either make one up or choose an
appropriate one from history.  Does anyone know the patron saint of
messengers?  How about the Order of Saint Hermes?  We could all be
Hermetian monks (sworn to poverty, in my case!), and Dagonell could be
our Father Superior! 

  If we can develop some reasonable group identity, then it might make
a certain amount of sense to register and use a badge.  Any number of
bad puns suggest themselves.  There is a treatment of the field called
"netted", which basically looks like ropes crossing the field
vertically and horizontally, knotted at the  intersections.  One might
even use a Eunuch (or two!) as a charge, though that's probably going
a touch too far.  On another tack: does anyone know an alchemical
symbol for Ether?  

I'll be happy to check any proposed badges for conflict and the like.

Good cheer to all!

	Arval.

Subject: Horse's Bransle and regional variation:  Final Report

My network connections have been a bit flaky, so I've been waiting to see
if all responses are in.  Since I haven't gotten anything (even 4 days old)
in almost a week, here are the results of the (very informal) survey on
Horse's Bransle:

First, a disclaimer -- since the responses I got were very skewed in number
toward the East Kingdom, specifically Carolingia, I'm not going to report
much "14 people said they did it this way, and only 2 said they did it
this way" type numbers, since I don't think they will be statistically
meaningful.

The overwhelming majority of respondents do Horse's Bransle
       1.  changing partners
       2.  in a long line
       3.  travelling to the left (next partner comes from current
               partner's right)

Changing partners is universal.  I received one report of a version where
partners are not changed when dancing in a line, but everyone else, from
all over, said they always change partners.  A couple of respondents
commented that the dance would be too dull without the switch.

Dancing in long lines is apparently by far the most common.  Based on my
experience and the responses I got, it appears that the Middle Kingdom and
areas strongly influenced by the Middle commonly do Horse's Bransle in a
circle, and everywhere else it is usually done in long lines.  Several
respondents commented they particularly like the idea of breaking up a
rather tame dance by requiring one lord to sprint down a long line to his
new place.  Many respondents said that, although they usually dance in a
line, they either have danced (or have heard of dancing) Horse's Bransle
in a circle.

Almost everyone travels to the left (next partner comes from current
partner's right).  This also appears to have the Middle Kingdom and
Midrealm influenced areas in a minority, because these areas generally
travel to the right (next partner comes from current partner's left)
(Note that this is the net effect if, when turning over your left shoulder,
you turn in place).

The most common other variant reported was varying the number of times
in a row the "Paw, Paw, step to the right, turn over your left shoulder"
part is repeated, which will of course depend on what music you are using.

There were several to many respondents for whom I could not guess a
location - I don't read e-mail addresses enough to be able to translate
them into geographic location, much less SCA location, so some of my
regional conclusions may be very skewed.

Thanks to everyone who passed along their versions of Horse's Bransle.

Greetings!

If by pirate you mean Bluebeard, "Arrgh and avast ye scurvy dogs!",
and a parrot on the shoulder, please don't.

On the other hand, there were certainly pirates in and around Europe
in period.  The widow of Simon de Montfort escaped England after her
husband's death and arrived in France nearly penniless because the
ship carrying her goods was taken by Channel pirates.  Piracy on the
Mediterranean is as old as shipping. 

Later in period, the privateers (better word than pirate; much more
respectable) became an important part of naval warfare.  Consider
Francis Drake, after all.

Subject: Greetings & Replies

To all those upon whose retinas these photons do impinge, GREETINGS!
I am Baron Steffan ap Cennydd of Silverwing, Pel, Firebrand Herald Extra-
ordinary. (Canton of the Towers, Carolingia, East). I'm the guy trying
to start a SCA-wide "SCA-philosophy" guild, so you'll be hearing from me.
A lot.
I'd like to reply to some of the discussions in the digests....
SHERRIFS: I recall, when I was Brigantia Herald under Laurel Wilhelm,
that Sherriff was determined to be an equivalent of Viscount; I don't know
if any Viscount has ever used it. In the East, Baron Yosef Alaric (yes, the
SCA MoAS) was made Sherriff (ceremonial ruling noble) of the Shire of
Smoking Rocks in 1976, and I believe he's the last such sherriff in the SCA;
the title, of course, can no longer be bestowed and shires don't have ruling
nobles.
BOD: Why do SCA members think that the SCA is so unique. It's a club, that's
all. Every club needs an administration. I find that most BoD-bashers (and I
admit I'm a veteran) have never dealt with the BoD directly, and have no idea
of what Corpora says. I have had occasion to deal with the BoD over several
years, to the end that Hilary actually invited me to help review the new
Corpora. Let me tell you, doing something like that really opens your ideas to
the way this club works, and _why_. True, the BoD used to be a bunch of SF fen
in Oakland, but they have become far more cosmopolitan in recent years. They
are admitting their mistakes, and they are asking for our opinions and our
help. Once that happens, I think the only honorable response is to meet them
halfway -- bashing the concept is non-productive. Furthermore, this leads to:
MEMBERSHIP: I simply can't see why 20 bucks is such an enormous burden. You
spend that for half a pair of Reeboks if you're lucky. You spend five times
that on a pair of gauntlets. You spend more than that on a single event! What
other club, from the Roman Church to the East Topeka Quilting Circle, gives
you the benefit of membership without requiring dues? What makes the SCA so
different from every other association of H. sapiens since we left the trees?
HEIRS: I understood that Cynagua had the Lord & Lady of the _Swan_ and OErtha
had the Lord & Lady of _the Snows_. Cute, but fantasy. I suggested a logical
alternative to Hilary, but she hasn't bought it...yet. There's a position in
the SCA (heir) without a real title and a title (Marquess/Marchioness) in
the mundane world without an SCA position. I propose we get 'em together.
Heirs would have to rank between Dukes & Counts, but I see no problem with
that. Comments?
WORDS: This is something I've been meaning to write more articles about (one 
recently appeared in the EK Northern Proto-Principality Newsletter). SCAdian
is not inherently offensive to me. You see, we call ourselves "the Knowne
Worlde" but that isn't accurate. There are "places" outside the "Knowne
Worlde" that my SCA self knows about, and has even been to: Markland, Cambria,
Acre, the lands of the Tuchux. These are other medievalist groups that
occasionally play in our game. So we are less than the entire world. Now,
Treble Clef Herald Extraordianry (Wilhem von Schlussel) has determined that
way way back when the West was all there was, it was occasionally called "the
Kingdom of the Mists" or "Mistland". Since _all_ of the SCA, even the East,
ultimately derives from the early West Kingdom, I propose that we call
ourselves (i.e. that the SCA's "group persona name") be "the Mistlandic
Empire"...or just "Mistland" if imperialism makes you sneeze. The concept of a
"group persona" is not new. The Markland Medieval Mercenary Militia has one
("Markland") and so does Medieval Studies an Recreation, Inc. ("the Kingdom of
Acre"). I cringe every time I hear "the Society" referred to in formal court
situations -- my persona has never heard of such an organization as the SCA.
Now, a mysterious place across the Ocean Sea called "Mistland" -- _that_ he
can deal with....Next message, I'll talk about the International League for
the Permanent Abolition of X-o-Crats.

*** SOAPBOX WARNING *** SOAPBOX WARNING *** SOAPBOX WARNING ***

My opinion (knowing nothing about any kingdom's official stand) is:
_BAN_ it, FORBID people to use it, OUTLAW the stuff.

Whoa, time out -- I have several good, long considered reasons for this
opinion.  I extend my opinion to materials such as kidex (sp?--kydex?),
kevlar, ceramic flak jacket plates, and most other modern high tech impact
absorbing/deflecting materials.

I have long understood that the SCA is, as I often hear spectators told at
demos, a "non-profit, educational organization that studies the Middle Ages
and Renaissance through re-creation."  As such, it is well worthwhile to
make the effort to keep our re-creations as historically correct as is
practical.  To this end, we should consider very carefully before permitting
a 20th century technological innovation to be used in our pre-1600
re-created combat.  If the material were being advocated for safety reasons,
making our fighting much safer for the participants and/or spectators than
is possible with period materials, I could consider supporting it.
However, the reasons Dani quotes are the material's lightness and ability
to shed all but the most direct blows.

I object to the perceived advantage of the material's lightness.  Yes, if
your sole goal is to win tournaments by being able to move faster for longer
than your opponent can, this could be an advantage.  But is our tournament
combat focused on winning?  I say it should not be - I would much rather
die honorably than win unchivalrously.  I think that using a modern material
such as teflon that weighs so much less than an equivalent protection in
period materials is an unfair advantage.  (Please don't tell me I could go
out and get a suit of it too - to (mis)quote West Side Story: "knives,
whips, chains, guns... what's next?" - escalation isn't the answer)

Now about the material's ability to shed blows - another unfair advantage.
We are, according to Society wide standards, presumed to be fighting
wearing "a light weight, short sleeved, knee length, riveted mail hauberk
over a padded gambeson, with boiled leather arm and leg defenses and an
open faced iron helm with a nasel" (Armor regs. published AS XIX - most
recent (and dog-eared) copy I've got).  Mail doesn't shed blows - it slows
them down and (minimally) spreads the impact.  Yes, it is possible to
strike blows against mail that are glancing, but the mail itself doesn't
do much to help a 'not quite perfect' blow go by.  Here again, I think the
modern material has an unfair advantage.  (Side note: I also have some
trouble with the idea of wearing full plate - some people do it well, and
accept anything they notice hitting them, while others require they be hit
with far too much force - but calibration escalation is a topic for some
other time)

Yet another point against the modern materials is the time required to
figure out how to work with them, hopefully trying to make a finished
product that at least vaguely resembles period armor.  Wouldn't it be
better to spend that time learning how armor was actually made, and keeping
a disappearing craft alive?

On the flip side, if a modern high-tech material can be shown to
substantially increase our safety, especially at little or no expense to
the period look and feel of what we are doing, I say let's go for it.  To
pick one example, I am very happy with high density closed cell foam
inside my helm - I wouldn't want to use felt, leather, or cloth, no matter
how "period" it may be.  But I don't see, either from the items that Dani
suggests, or from previous discussions (real-time, not email) on kevlar,
kidex (sp? that word again) or similar materials, that there is any safety
advantage to be gained over armor made of "period' materials.

I suggest that we not advocate the use of 20th century materials solely on
the basis of their advantages in winning fights.  We are re-creating a
history that never was, and some of the romance goes out of it when
technology takes over.

Subject: Teflon Armor and spears

Greetings,
	A question. Is the teflon armor, teflon coated steel?
	There are several ways to make a weapon stick better.
	One is to tape a layer of split leather on so that the leather is
	exposed. This will help make it stick better.
	For a thrusting tip, Sir Dublin used a circle cut from old deck shoes.
	You could also use double back tape, but this will collect junk
	and may be dangerous. (stuff may come off in a face)

Milords, I also want to toss in my 2 pennies.  There seem to be two
armor factions here.  The first faction want to make armor to be as
light and energy absorbing as possible.  Historical considerations are
an afterthought.  I don't want to make outrageous generalizations, but
I seem to find more of this type in the west.  The second faction is
almost fanatical about its insistance on historical accuracy.  Comfort
and cost are at best secondary.

The fact is we do not use armor in the same way that it was used in
period.  A real fighter could expect to be hit at most a handful of
times in the leg, then the leg would be gone.  Helmets didn't have to
be padded very well because they didn't get hit more than a few times.
We get bashed hundreds or even thousands of times.  In addition, most
of us do not have the services of a full time armorer or much money.
I find using high tech materials for combat advantage to be repugnant.
On the other hand, leather over kydex may be the only option for some.

Subject: request for piracy info

    Greetings from Bergental!

  I am mulling over the possibility of an alternate late-period
persona of a pirate (such a pejorative term-- I like to think of
it as a cavalier with a real job.)  I'm having a terrible time
getting in-depth sources.  Since the heyday of piracy was just
post-period, the earlier history seems to get quickly summarized
and forgotten.  Of particular interest is the coast of Brittany.
I've been able to find a paragraph about a Breton pirate, the
widow of Sir Olivier de Clisson, but no more.  Does anybody have
any suggestions?
   As for a replacement for the word 'mundane,' why not use
"goyim"?  Just a suggestion...

Here is a review of the last Ansteorra crown tournament, graciously written
for me by Jessica (don't know the rest of her name, or titles...) of Loch
Soilleir, who was, unlike myself, fortunate enough to attend the event.

--------------------

   Unfortunately, the only event I have been able to attend lately has
been crown tournament in Greywood. Actually it was held in the
soon-to-be-reinstated incipient Shire of Ardonarain (Tyler.) The site was
beautiful! The fighting was in a large clearing with forest all around.
Towers are being constructed for future SCA use. The fighting was, as
always, a pleasure to watch. Everyone fought with chivalry and fervor. Yes,
 there was some rain, but that did not stop the brave fighters of
Ansteorra (they're used to it!) The last bout was between His Excellency
Count Dinaris and Sir Gerard MacEanruig. It was a long and tough fight,
but finally Sir Gerard won. During court, many awards were given out.
Greywood took many awards, all of which were well deserved. The feast was
excellent and plentiful, as Greywood feasts usually are. All in all, I had 
a very good time.

The Elf Hill Times Songbook is good, but it is distinct from the
An Tir Songbook, which it is based on.  Many of the good songs in the
An Tir Songbook had to be dropped from the EHT Songbook because the
copyright could not be obtained for them.  For example, I believe that
the "Dove Displayed Upon a Billet" song mentioned a week or so ago
is in the An Tir but not the EHT.

ON THE USE OF THE RAPIER			     Geoffrey Mathias
					Baron Sir  Patri du Chat Gris
The  determination  of the best techniques for handling the classical
tournament  weapons  (sword & sheild, etc.)  within  the SCA has come
about  largely  through  a process of experimentation and analysis of
what apparently does or does not work on the fighting field.  In  the
case  of  the  rapier, however,  there  exists additional sources for
information within the published literature of the late sixteenth and
early  seventeenth  centuries.  These  works  delineate in detail the
precise manner of  handling  this  weapon  as  advocated  by  various
masters  of  the  art.  These  masters  were  by no means in complete
agreement, which lead to the formation of different styles or schools
divided for the most part along national  lines.  We will discuss the
specific  characteristics  of  these  schools,  and  demonstrate with
weapons in hand some of the modes of attack and defense which  derive
from  them.  We  will  also  discuss the physical differences between
rapiers of the late sixteenth century and currently available fencing
weapons   which   affect  the  implementation  of  sixteenth  century
techniques in SCA rapier combat.			       1 hour

the ecliptic, and the date and hour of the equinox.  If time  permits
several  other  experiments  for determining the details of the sun's
orbit around the earth may be covered.			       1 hour

Subject: aluminum armor


Good gentles, I seek your advice and opinions on aluminum armor.

I'm considering aluminum armor, particularly for my shoulders and arms.
As a beginning heavy fighter, I want protection, but light weight
protection.

Some questions to start you thinking:  Do you have any good "no shit,
there we were" stories involving aluminum armor?  How does aluminum
compare to steel in ease of working?  Does it dent easily and require
lots of reshaping maintenance?  How much protection does aluminum provide
compared to steel?  I'd really appreciate specific details, preferably
based on experience.

I've talked to His Highness Drew Fortesque (long live the Prince and
Princess of the Mists!) at his armoring workshop, but he has no experience
with aluminum.  He did say that the weight (gauge) of the aluminum was
critical, and also that it matters if it's a flat splint, a simple curve
or a complex curve, so please say what weight of aluminum was involved
and whether it was pauldrons or splints or whatever.

Also, can you suggest any way to make aluminum look period, or at least
minimize its out-of-period appearance?  A surcote won't help too much
on vambraces...

And, do you think using improved technology like this, which provides
an advantage over period technology, introduces a question of honor?
Would you think differently about it for a novice and for a serious
contender in the crown lists?

Subject: Simple gifts

I do not have any words to add, but some background. The song referred to is
a hymn of the Shakers, perhaps one of their best known and best loved hymns.
The Shakers were a religious sect that believed (among other things) in
strict abstinence (from sex as well as drink). Since this implies no
reproduction, they did not try to foist their views onto everyone else. They
lived simple lives on communal farms and believed that everything must be
done the best that it can be, as a measure of devotion and love of God.
Hence their simple wooden furniture (for example) is considered some of the
most beautiful Americana of all. If I recall correctly, there were upwards
of a dozen communities when the movement was at its peak, but it was down
to a few aged folk by the beginning of this century and can now be
considered defunct. While not period, they were certainly interesting.
Perhaps this background will make it easier to find the full text, as well
as the music, to the hymn in question.

Subject: dancing

we know from Arbeau that bransles were danced in suites of 10, and that is how 
they are arranged in the seven "Livres de Danceries" published about 1550 by 
Attaingnant--a suite of 6 to 10 branls gay or bransles de poiteu (both lively
 dances with one foot in the air most of the time), a suite of branles simple 
(shield foot, shield foot, sword foot), double (double left, double right, 
repeat), 10 or 12 bransles de champagne or de bourgogne, which Arbeau calls 
'mixed bransles' and which include guere, charlotte, sabots, pois, etc.  The 
simple and double bransles would be a lot less boring than they sound because 
they did variations or 'divisions' like the galliards.  They may have done this 
in bransles gay as well, we know the did it to poicteu, because M. Arbeau 
dissaprooved of it.  The ataingnant books also clump the almands and the 
galliards, although each pavan is generally followed by 1 or 2 galliards.

I think it is definitely not right to exclude the more advanced dances 
"because the people who do them get to do them every week" because unless you 
run *very* spiffy dance practices its just not the same as dancing in garb in 
a hall full of garbed people when you have had several hours to put yourself 
into a medieval world view.  What *I* would like to see (the follow oppinion 
is my own and not shared by any one that i can think of off hand) is a few (no 
more than 5) slots set each event for a set of people (a *different* set for 
each dance) to do a dance not as a performance per se, but simply as a set of 
people doing a dance in an adequate space by themselves as it would have been 
done in period.

I'm not disagreeing with you either. I'd just like a clearer explanation.

Greetings,

	This letter is in relpy to Dani Zweig's note on Teflon armor.
As a relatively new subscriber to the digest I haven't had any previous
opportunity to reply to a letter, so here it goes.  

	As far as I know, Teflon armor is not used in Calontir.  I've
spoken with some of the local fighters about it but they're not to
familiar with it.  However, a local fighter is experimenting with 
Kydex helmets.  Any comments?

	I hope to send more enlightening news in the future.

Subject: dance

this is my second try sending this.  if it looks excessively similar to 
something youv'e seen already, just skip it.

we know from Arbeau that bransles were danced in suites of 10, and that is how 
they are arranged in the seven "Livres de Danceries" published about 1550 by 
Attaingnant--a suite of 6 to 10 branls gay or bransles de poiteu (both lively
 dances with one foot in the air most of the time), a suite of branles simple 
(shield foot, shield foot, sword foot), double (double left, double right, 
repeat), 10 or 12 bransles de champagne or de bourgogne, which Arbeau calls 
'mixed bransles' and which include guere, charlotte, sabots, pois, etc.  The 
simple and double bransles would be a lot less boring than they sound because 
they did variations or 'divisions' like the galliards.  They may have done this 
in bransles gay as well, we know the did it to poicteu, because M. Arbeau 
dissaprooved of it.  The ataingnant books also clump the almands and the 
galliards, although each pavan is generally followed by 1 or 2 galliards.

I think it is definitely not right to exclude the more advanced dances 
"because the people who do them get to do them every week" because unless you 
run *very* spiffy dance practices its just not the same as dancing in garb in 
a hall full of garbed people when you have had several hours to put yourself 
into a medieval world view.  What *I* would like to see (the follow oppinion 
is my own and not shared by any one that i can think of off hand) is a few (no 
more than 5) slots set each event for a set of people (a *different* set for 
each dance) to do a dance not as a performance per se, but simply as a set of 
people doing a dance in an adequate space by themselves as it would have been 
done in period.

Message-Id: <28223@tut.cis.ohio-state.edu>

Hello!  I just started attending SCA meetings and events this quarter at OSU,
so I have some questions I'm curious about.  Here goes...

How do the geographical/political divisions of the society relate to each
other in terms of size and authority and such?  For example, what's the
difference between a canton, a shire, and a barony?  How big is a principality?

How do people learn about SCA and decide to join?  Is there a narrow or wide
age distribution in most groups?  I'm wondering how representative OSU's
group is since it's in a campus setting and has a lot of student members.

How long are the reigns of various types of royalty?  Are tournaments held
on a regular basis for the purpose of determining the successors?  And are
there any royal figures who become royalty by means other than fighting?

                                Thanks for your input!

     No, no, and no.  In a very general sense, we could be said to share
the same Dream, but each person's dream is unique in some respects.  For
instance, some of us seem to be mainly interested in recognition, awards,
etc. (these are the people who complain that Lady Tudor-Glitz is based
directly on *them*), while others don't care about awards, just so they
can pretend to be living in a D&D game or fantasy story.  Then there are
the barbarians, the people who are looking for interesting parties, and
various other eccentric people.  Then there are the normal, sensible ;-)
people like myself, who are interested in reviving lost arts such as
Renaissance dance, Medieval cookery, and so on.  The one thing that we
all have in common seems to be a desire to feel that we are living in
another time and culture, a sort of ersatz time machine (this phenomenon
is known as "past shock" ;-) ).  We are attempting to live in the good
old days that never were.  So the SCA basically amounts to a psycho-
sociological experiment in inventing/reinventing a culture.
     Unfortunately, since such Medieval necessities as tunics & hose,
armor, etc. are not useful in the Mundane world, our Society tends to be
rather expensive.  Also, we seem to suffer from a disorganized system of
communications in which the most useful information available frequently
ends up being lost in the shuffle, while worthless misinformation is
widely distributed.  Thus, it is difficult to keep this experimental
society going.  For these reasons, among others, it is very rare that
more than a very few people will be able to live their dream in the same
place at the same time, even though many of us are able to agree in very
general terms on what the Dream is.

     Now that I have read what I just wrote, I don't think it's really
as clear or coherent as it ought to be, but I don't feel like going to
the trouble of fixing it.

     I'd like to strengthen that still more: yes.  Arbeau says (rough
paraphrase from memory) that when people did bransles at a revel, they
would start with the Double Bransle and the Single Bransle, and everyone
would join in these because they're easy and slow.  Then they'd do the
Gay Bransle and maybe another (I forget), and some of the older and less
energetic people would drop out.  Then they would do a suite consisting
of a whole lot of dances called the Bransles of Burgundy, or Champagne,
or some such place (they seem to have been uncertain, even at the time,
of what place they preferred to attribute them to), each of which had its
own name, including the Scottish Bransle and one or two others named for
places other than the one the suite is named for.  These seem to have
been done mainly by the dedicated dancers.  The total number of dances
comes out to well over a dozen, and perhaps as many as two dozen, even
without allowing for the possibility that they might also have done a
pavane and galliard, or other dances, in the same evening.

Ooops. I strongly disagree. If one is interested in learning a new dance,
it can hardly be boring.

Personally, I don't mind "re-learning" a dance at a revel. I am rarely able
to remember the name of the dance, its steps and the music as a whole, and
so I welcome the chance to refresh my memory. ("Juice of Barley? Uh, is
that the one where the couples go in and through or over and around?")

Our dance practices have a hard-core group of about 6 people, but often
there are 12 or more at the practice. The once-in-a-while folks should have
a crack at learning too. (Besides, I LOOOOVE to dance and will do so at
almost any chance. Especially when I can put the body on auto-pilot and
concentrate on flirting... )

  In response to the idea that the only way to get awards is to know a local
crown, I disagree.  Some of my closer friends got AoA's from a king from far
away from our local area.  Some of my friends and I wrote to the crown to 
recommend these people, and lo and behold it happened at one of the next 
local events that the crown attended.  It has been my experience that you 
need to write the crown to get a response.  

  I should add a side note here...  This only pertains to the "smaller" 
awards and some kingdom level awards.  The peerage awards do seem to be 
given to local types or someone known to the crown.  The peerage awards
are given after peer circles are held in several areas within the kingdom
with the crown in attendance.  These awards are somewhat political in 
nature and spuriously given out at the best of times, not at all in the
worst of times.

Subject: Period dance

Addressing Gwydion's question: "is it really period to do 10 or 15 dances
at an event, instead of 3 or 4 longer ones?" (my paraphrase).

Dani has already given the concise answer: probably. I'd like to strengthen
that a little. Many of the dances that are well suited for dancing for 
indefinite periods of time, like Hole in the Wall or Mad Robin, are *very* 
*very* late, mostly late 17th century, or even early 18th. Even the earlier 
English Country dances really do have a set pattern that goes once through and 
stops.  Indeed, this distinction between dances that run for a set time and 
dances that continue indefinitely is a not-half-bad distinction between early 
English Country and modern Contras. There are a few exceptions, but those are 
mostly Galliards, Pavanes, and the like, which aren't often the point of 
contention...

Now, if you *really* want to be period, you should have one set dancing for
the entertainment of the crowd at large and the Presence in particular, but
I won't go into that...

Message-Id: <596132289/kee@A.NL.CS.CMU.EDU>

Here are some more fewmets for the flames:

My favorite desk dictionary (Webster's Collegiate, Seventh of the Name)
has as its first definition of the word "mundane", "1: of, relating to,
or characteristic of the world."  The second definition is "2:
characterized by the practical, transitory and ordinary: having no
concern for the ideal or heavenly."  This I take in no wise to be The
Gospel Truth About That Word, but it seems a pretty good indication that in
1963 (the copyright date of this dictionary), the standard American
English meaning of the word was closely related to the way we now use it
in the Society.  However, in the last 25 years it seems to have acquired 
primarily pejorative overtones, and I have unintentionally offended
at least three non-SCA-members that I know of, by my use of it.  So I
am trying (rather unsuccessfully, I think) to avoid its use in referring
to people.

The word "Scadian".  I first remember hearing this word when I moved to 
Atlantia in A.S. XVI.  It sounded really silly to me for about three
weeks.  After that I quit noticing that it seemed odd, and started
using it myself eventually.  It does have parallels in "Canadian" and
"Acadian" (and probably other terms as well.)  I use it when I am not
in persona (e.g., *not* at events--the thought of someone standing up and
saying, "My fellow Scadians, I propose a toast" seems pretty jarring
to me!)  I have found it to be a very useful term, and I think using it
for "meta-discussions" such as those we indulge in here, is just fine.
However, knowing that its use is a regional phenomenon, I have
consciously avoided it when talking with folk from more westerly realms.
For the purposes of this forum, however, I have thrown caution to the
winds.  I figure most of us are laid back enough to just have a good
giggle if we think it sounds silly.  If I'm wrong about that, don't
rush to inform me of the fact. ;-)

As to "medievalist", being an old Humanities addict, I am conditioned
to think of that word as referring to a mundane scholar who studies the
Middle Ages.  Tolkein was a medievalist, for instance.  It sounds a
little presumptuous to me to hear it used to refer to SCA members
generally.  (I'm sure that if I were used to hearing it that way, it
wouldn't strike me as odd.)  I like the term "anachronist" but it is
hardly ever used here on the East Coast.  On the other hand, here at
CMU one meets many (non-SCA) Californians, who tend to know SCA members
by that term, so I hear it occasionally.

About polearms, I submit that to an Easterner, the question looks very
different--not, "what in the world can you do without face thrusts?",
but "how can polearm be very interesting when there's that easy face
thrust seducing everyone into trying for it--it must really constrain
their style a lot!"  In addition, we differentiate between a spear
(padded only at the tip, only attack is thrusting, up to 9 feet long)
and a polearm (padded for 1/3 of its length, up to 6 feet long; can
thrust and slash, and in the East we also allow a "butt spike", or
thrusting tip at the other end, but in the Midrealm those are banned.)
In Kyrsteen's post, it sounds like what she means by "polearm" could be
what we would call a spear, and what we call a "polearm" she quite sensibly
calls a "glave."

I think we've covered spears pretty well here; they are very useful
even without face thrusts.  You thrust for thighs and abdomens and chests,
and when you are working down low behind your shield people, you can get
through tiny openings, and your head is down a lot so you hide
effectively.  (How do we hit people in the head?  With polearms! ;-)
If your shield people are used to working with spears, they will help
you get openings at your preferred height.

The reasons for excluding face thrusts are, alas, somewhat
controversial.  Many people (myself included) are not inclined to like
the idea of putting ourselves in a position where it is very easy to
have one's neck shoved back suddenly.  The notion of having someone use
a (wobbly rattan) spear to try to gently tap my face causes me a fair
amount of concern.  In fact, at a Pennsic (which shall remain
numberless) in a bridge battle against the shield wall of a certain
group (which shall remain nameless), I was repeatedly face-thrust with
12-foot rattan spears, and I didn't like it one bit.  There wasn't that
much control possible, and when I refused to die to it (at Pennsic,
face thrusts are illegal) they just thrust me harder.  (The marshalls
intervened finally to remind them of the rules, after which I died in
short order to a legal blow.  My neck was sore for a week, and I
resolved not to be so dangerously stubborn in the future.  I was stupid.)

If I thought that the "touch is a kill" rule were enforceable, I would
withdraw my objections.  In a kingdom where no such rule currently
exists, how long would it take for people to change their styles
sufficiently to make it safe?   What happens during the phasing-in
period?  Has anyone made a careful study of how this turned out in
Atlantia, by the way?

The scuttlebutt has it that soon face thrusts will be legal in the
East, anyway.  This is causing something of a moral dilemma for some of
us; do we cut back on fighting during the adjustment period?  I suspect
that if it goes through, in a couple of years everyone will be used to
it, but not before an appreciable number of people will have quit fighting 
rattan due to safety concerns.  I hope that no real injuries come out
of the phasing-in (assuming the rumor is true.)

As to other types of head shots, personally I feel the overall level of
calibration is too high.  We don't know that much about the possible
long-term effects of such repeated sudden blows to the head.  It may be
perfectly harmless, or it may be doing subtle damage over time.  You
don't have to make my teeth rattle to make me take a head shot, but
the people I meet in a melee generally have no way of knowing that.
I think the SCA as a whole needs to take this issue more seriously.
Else we are likely to end up providing medical science with a whole
class of interesting mild brain damage cases, as more and more fighters
reach middle age (and beyond.)  There's no question it's a lot safer
than boxing, but that's not saying much.

I had always heard rumors that in some Kingdoms the glave (or polearm)
was banned as a tourney weapon.  Is this true, then?  If so, probably
the only way to change it is to educate enough people to get a
consensus going in favor of giving the weapon its proper due.
Traditions are, after all, generally regarded as carved in stone. ;-)

Well, that's my monthly lump.  Opinions are mine and not necessarily
those of any group I associate with, Scadian or mundane. (hee-hee-hee)

Subject: don't ever call any one 'mundane' (except in special cases)

My lord Michael Johnson, Greeting!

I will dictate your behavior to you.

All of us in the S.C.A. are under obligation to treat all persons with 
courtesy.  If one person, acting as a member of the society, speaks 
insultingly or in a belittling manner to one who is new to or strange to the 
society, it reflects ill upon the honor of every member of the society.  
Therefore, in protection of my own honor, I cannot stand by and condone the 
ill-behavior of another society member.  Those who aspire to chivalry are 
under further obligation to protect those who are new or foriegn to the 
society and can be expected to take stronger action than i.

Now it is perfectly understandable that you should not appreciate being 
corrected by people you don't know.  I don't enjoy it myself.  Fortunately in 
my case, i have friends who will point out to me when i am wrong, and further 
i am bound in loyalty and service to my lady, who is gentle and wise and will 
direct me when i err. I strongly reccomend that you aquire some friends and a 
lord/lady/master/knight/laural/pelican/whatever who will do the same for you; 
they are good things to have.

As for your interpretation of the use of dictionaries:  It is true that words 
change in meaning, and that dictionaries can only give the most common 
meanings and can only lag behind the populace in reporting what words mean.  
However, 1) words, when they change, rarely change for the better.  Thus we 
have words such as sinester, vulgar, churl, and villan which used to mean 
perfectly innocuous things, and are now insulting.  If Eduardo has found a 
dictionary that gives a deffinition of 'mundane' that is insulting, it is 
likely that the word has and will continue to have a pejorative meaning to 
most people (i must confess to some curiosity as to what dictionary he is 
using--American Heritage merely gives "of this world," "ordinary,"  while 
Webster's Colegiate gives further "transitory, usual," and gives as a synonym 
"earthly" and antonym "eternal".). 2) Within an SCA context mundane means what 
we use it to mean in the SCA.  The presence of someone not in the SCA, or too 
new to have aquired familiarity with our jargon, removes the context from the 
SCA, and the word means again what it means to the populace at large.  Thus to 
refer to someone *in his presence* as a mundane is either directly insulting 
(see 1) or else exclusionary, and hence insulting (see 2).  It is in either 
case not reccommended.

I will be happy to duscuss this point further.  If, however, you are going to 
use swear words, please send mail directly to me, and do not publish it to the 
Rialto in general.

  Dear Gentles, 
     In response to the letter (sender unknown to me at this time) which

As Sir Raymond's squire, I am reasonably (99.999%) sure that he doesn't carry
the aforementioned book. I, however, do not have any idea who carries that

Greetings, Good Gentles!

I would add another pair of designations to your list.  In the land where
I spent my youth (which is now the Kingdom of the Outlands)  there was
a group in the far south known as the Freehold of Great River (Las Cruces, NM)
and another in the Farther South (El Paso, Tx) known as the Citadel of the 
South.

I think you will find that these groups are officially recorded as
"The Shire of the Freehold of Great River" or "Barony of the Citadel
of the South", and so on.  For example, the Eastern group known
generally as "Mountain Freehold" is actually "The Province of Mountain
Freehold".  Personally, I find these "official" branch definitions
silly and pointless.  If we are going to categorize groups by status,
fine.  Let there be a Baronial status, a shire status, a canton
status, and so on.  I see no reason why these silly words should be
part of the place names.  The Baron of Wilster (to create an example)
rules a place called Wilster.  Calling it "The Barony of Wilster" is
silly and needlessly inauthentic.  Our usage of "Canton" and "Shire"
is even more absurd.  Those are bureaucratic designations, not a part
of the place name.

Let's try to use real place names, and to use them in real ways!

Subject: Teflon Armor

The debate over whether to allow teflon armor in the East has been growing
apace.  On the one hand are its obvious advantages:  It is very light, and all
but the most direct blows just slide off.  (It is especially effective against
poltruded fibreglass.)  Furthermore, in a pinch, various parts of the armor can
double as cooking gear.

On the other hand, teflon armor is relatively ineffective against a sufficiently
direct thrust.  It is also  notoriously hard to take proper care of.  A fighter
whose teflon armor has been cleaned with steel-wool is a sorry sight indeed!

What stances have the other kingdoms taken on this topic?

Subject: Books on lives of non-traditional women

I very much enjoyed the book "The Weaker Vessel" by Antonia Fraser, a writer
of history in England (and, interestingly, married to Harold Pinter). It was
published in 1984, ISBN 0-297-78381-5 (hardcover; maybe there's a paper
version now), by Weidenfeld & Nicolson, Ltd.; 91 Clapham High Street; London
SW4 7TA; United Kingdom. It should be available in the US, too, of course,
but I bought my copy while I was on a trip to London, so I don't know the
publisher here. It chronicles lives of women in England in the 1600's.
Unlike many books, which boil down the sources and try to summarize, this
book does much quoting from original sources, and while some patterns are
discussed, the author hesitates to draw too many conclusions (because it is
always difficult to know how representative the sources are). The century in
question was an interesting one because it cincludes the period of the
revolution, commonwealth, and protectorate (Cromwell), and the return to
royal rule. Women's involvement in all of this is detailed quite
interestingly. I would say that one of the main things that sticks with me
is how the double burden of lack of legal standing and lack of birth control
strongly affected women's lives in that period (and needless to say, up to
the current day in many places). You may find "The Weaker Vessel" especially
valuable because of its citations of original sources.

I've enjoyed and appreciated the responses to my initial query, but I'm
beginning to see that my questions were too group-specific.  Clearly there are
groups in which having a dancing mini-schola during a tourney would be practical
and groups where it wouldn't.  There are groups which have regular dance
practices and groups which don't have any.  What is a problem for one type of
group may be very much of a non-issue for another.

The problem here (actually, I haven't been receiving *complaints* about the
matter, but the person running the dancing is required to be sensitive to the
problem anyway) arises from an unusual mix of circumstances, including large and
frequent (most months) events (almost always with dancing), a relatively
isolated barony, and a relatively large core (about thirty regulars) of
~advanced dancers.

Very period, I suspect.  The issue here seems to be more of the same:
infrequent dancers are capable of enjoying spending half an evening dancing
"Hole in the Wall" and another quarter doing "Strip the Willow".  If you're
dancing every week, however, even the prospect of doing the same *twenty* dances
every week begins to pall.  Also, in addition to seeking a wider variety, you
begin to be willing to do more *challenging* dances -- including the sort that
*can't* be taught to beginners in a half-hour afternoon schola.  So you find
yourself, at events, trying to satisfy advanced dancers and novices with very
different desires and requirements.

I know of three groups in the East Kingdom where dancing is a major activity.
It seems to be a matter of critical mass, of luck, of resources to get started,
of the degree to which dance practice is also a major *social* gathering.  Oddly
(or interestingly, or sadly) enough, the overlap in the dances done in these
groups appears to be remarkably small.  (We, for example, seem to be the
society's Playford fiends.)  There are other groups where people never have an
opportunity to dance except at 'foreign' events.  And everything between.  I may
have been asking a much more specialized question than I realized.

Actually, it seems as if our system of government is much closer to
anarchy than to monarchy (not anarchy as in chaos, but as in
individuals as the unit of soverignity).  And anyway, our traditions
are much stronger than any of our laws, and are followed much more
often.  Dumb laws often just get ignored, and their creators get nasty
songs written about them.  I suppose all of this changes if you care
about Society politics, but quite a fair number of us don't have any
interest in our politics at all.  Our kings and queens have little
real power - what they do have is our respect, and because of that
respect they can expect the cooperation of the populace.  Without
that, they won't get anything done.

I disagree - while it may be difficult to motivate letters from people,
should the crown receive a dozen letters praising a gentle's virtues,
they will notice.  At least, I've noticed this in my home kingdom, Trimaris.
It has not been a few times that I have heard the giving of an award
prefaced by either crowned head stating that while they knew little about
the gentle, the letters they received were overwhelming.  It's not just for
the crown to notice the good that goes on in the kingdom, it is for the
populace to notice, as well, and inform the crown when it escapes their
attention.  Writing letters can be effective.

Subject: rambling thoughts

I have been reading all kinds of interesting things
lately, and would like to put in my 2 cents on a couple
of the topics too:
1: Mangled language:
  a) 'scadian': what a silly word! The first time I ever
  heard the word, it made me cringe. A gentleman who moved 
  here (from the Midrealm I think) used it at a Demo. What
  is wrong with using 'mediaevalist'?    At events especially,
  using 'gentles' (it sounds period at least). 
  b) 'whateverocrat': autocrat could be replaced with another
  term, but again it at least sounds like a real word and
  aperiod one at that.  An even in period, head cooks may
  not have done much real cooking, most of thier time being
  taken up in organising the kitchen, which is what our 
current middle ages head cooks do (at least here in An Tir)
  c) I think Steward of the Society is a perfectly p
  perfectly period usage of the word, and even if we
change 'autocrat' to 'Event Steward' there is no reason
  to have to change it.
 
2:Stick Talk:
I fight almost exclusively with a polearm, and I
cannot  imagine why some kingdoms still have peole
who do when they have excluded thrusts to the face.
My effectiveness with a pike would be almost nil,
as in crowded battle situations, particularly multi-
ranked lines or castle battles faceplates are the
majority of targets which present themselves. I hit
more faces peeking over shields than any other target
(except maybe thighs). I suppose bladed polearms would
still be effective for crown or side of the head shots
but? I have only run a pike in castle battles, not
field battles, but the tactics seem to be about
the same: use the pike while in formation, but
carry a secondary weapon for contingencies. I like
to carry a mace or shortsword, even with my naginata.
(glave). And I have a question: Why the heck are 
thrusts to the face illegal anyway (can someone in
a kingdom where this is the case please respond?)
I have been smashed harder to the side of the head
than I ever have been hit with a thust to the face
(and believe me I've died that way a lot!) 
Last bone I have to pick: In the middle ages, the
standard weapon for foot tourney was the glave,
sword and shield was actually a very rare challenge!
how the heck can we justify ruling them out of the
lists in an SCA tournament? (Pet peeve of a polearmer)

Subject: awards & letters

Milady Moira Catherine Mathews, Greeting!

I can see that it might feel odd to write to someone whom you have never met,
but allow be to give two pieces of advice:

1) Screw your courage to the sticking point (a fine thing to do when deeling
with kings) and write anyway.  Kingship is an office, like the president of 
the u.s. or the leutenant govornor of your state.  Part of the office is 
handing out awards.  Therefore your report of the worthyness of x to bear arms 
is business from one responsible society member to another.  It is not a favor 
asked of a freind and the fact that you don't know the king is irrelevant.
The obligations of Fealty run both ways.  We owe the king our loyalty and 
support and obedience "to all his most resonable requests" (as it states in our 
charter). The King in turn is responsible for the wellfare of his 
subjects--all of them, not just the knights and dukes (in fact, if the king 
also is one of those who aspires to the ideals of chivalry, he will be 
especially concerned with the welfare of those who have little power or 
presige within the kingdom).  In the SCA this generaly comes down to visiting 
as many places withing the kingdom as possible and recognizing and encouraging 
good work and those who do it.  Your barony might be able to helps the king in 
the former by puting in a bid for a kingdom event, but *everyone* can help in 
the later by telling the king who is doing the good work.

2)  You need not write all by your self.  Does your group have guilds, 
housholds, fighting companys, things of that nature?  Can you get together a 
group of former autocrats or other peopple who have reason to know of the good 
qualities of x to write a letter with you?  Perhaps your seneschal (hi Kobi) 
or baron could give you some suggestions.  Our barony has two baronial orders 
whose members try to keep track of who is doing what and write letters 
accordingly.

one last advice/opinion
3)  Never think that an AoA is the only title that caries weight or respect 
with it.  The following is an incomplete list of those titles whos holders i 
will resepect at least as much or more than someone who is 'lord' or 'lady':
autocrat, guildmistress, listmistress, martial, chirugian, poursuivant, -- i 
trust you get my drift.  and as for the person who comes to an event and 
cleans up after i have spent 24 solid hours cooking (hi Trahern)! words fail 
me.

Said song and said device both belong to Baldwin of Erebor, whom I

Most likely the studio just made a deal with the state to get a set of
plates, regardless of who owned them, with the provision that the car
only be on the road for filming. (A reasonable request, seeing as the
studio would hardly be driving an expensively modified car around just
to run for burgers... :^] )

Don't presume to dictate my actions to me, ever.

I will bloody well use the word "mundane" as much as I care to. I not only
have yet to see anyone use the word to belittle, I also have yet to see
anyone take offense from use of the word.

Your last point, which makes reference to the dictionary meaning of "mundane",
happens to hit on one of MY pet peeves, which is that people view the
dictionary as engraving in stone the meaning of a word. Which is ridiculous.
Words are not static entities. They evolve and change, in meaning, in
pronunciation, and in spelling. The use of the word "mundane" by members of the
SCA is a perfect example of this. The meaning of the word, within the SCA,
does not match the meaning cited in the dictionary. This simply means that the
dictionary is out of date. It does not mean that members of the SCA are using
the word wrongly.

You can see many other examples of this principle in "mundane" life. The
word "computer" used to mean a person who computes. Now it refers to a machine.
Similarly, new meanings have evolved for words such as "memory", "highway",
and "terminal". A highway was once any raised road. Now its common use is to
describe only a high-speed limited access roadway. A terminal used to be a
building at the end of a rail line. Now it most often refers to a CRT display
device attached to a computer.

When someone points to a dictionary and says "this is what this word means, so
your use of the word in a new way is wrong" it pisses me off.

Unfortunately, there are those who are NOT able to attend regular (or
irregular) dance practices in any given group, assuming the group has one.
I do tend to agree with an approach of teaching during the afternoon and
having no instruction during the evening.

One thing which I think people have not considered is the question of how
period is it to actually DO 10 or 15 (for sake of slightly exaggerated
argument) at one event? Do we dance to show off how many different dances
we know, or do we dance for the social aspects?

I bring up this point because the Scottish society on campus has a semesterly
Ceilidh where only 3 or 4 dances are done with many minutes of each one,
alternating back and forth, with occassional breaks for the musicians. At the
beginning, I'm sure many more people were learning the dances/tripping over
their own feet, but later in the evening most people were just going at it.

 Good Gentles--

 I have noticed one thing in regards to AoA's:  Unless you are exceedingly 
 well liked by your fellow local members, or happen to know the King (or a
 Duke, or other Peer) personally, most people do not tend to get awards.  In
 my local area, several people received their AoA's this summer.  I have not
 been in the Society for long, but I could tell that several of these people
 had been deserving for quite some time (including one person who had been in
 5 years and served as herald for a good portion of that time).  However, until
 someone close to home became King, none of them received awards.  Whether I
 deserve mine or not, I probably will not receive it until someone close to 
 home is King again--if at all in the future.  It would probably help consider-
 ably if there is some sort of, oh, I don't know, "voting system" in which 
 a form is printed and put out in the Kingdom newsletter or with membership
 card renewals where once a year, you put up so many people for an award, and
 then it's sort of "taken care of" for those who do not feel sure enough of 
 themselves to write to the King by their lonesome.  I'm not "crown shy", but
 unless I know the King personally, whether it be close or not, I don't feel
 comfortable writing to Him.

 Any thoughts as to whether this would be a practical idea or not?

 I remain--
     
         In Service to the Dream--

William,

     I suddenly feel confoozed. First you write;

     How can you believe that the best system is one which you disagree with?

     Please explain to me why placing the law changes under the above 
structure would improve things, given that you've now advocated in the
second paragraph what you so expressively denounced in the first.

     Please explain to me what would prevent the Curia from becoming an 
organized faction full of political intrigue and voting, what would stop
the Great Officers of State and all resident Peers from becoming a organized
faction full of political intrigue and voting and how this defusement of
authority would be an improvment over the current system.

(Other than it's Period. I personally don't care for that rational. The 
Society isn't Period, the word is not an agreed upon standard. Which Period?
The early 15th Cent.? Or the Middle of the 13th? Or how about the late 10th?
I rightfully become suscpious of people who bandy it about to support causes
because the word Period is usually used to mask a series of issues or
problems that no one is looking at or wants to look at. The problem here
is not that the system doesn't work as is but that a minority of people feel
that the King can too easily abuse the authority granted him and that he might
change something which would destroy their idea of the Dream).

     Doesn't this simply all boil down to the age old them vs. us argument,
"Should you trust you Stick Jocks to Rule Wisely?" 

     BTW - I am West Kindgom born and bred. I don't like the idea of Curias.
The King's word is law. Remember, this isn't Renaissance Faire. We're
suppose to be doing this for *fun*.

Perhaps there should be regular dance "scholas" at events.   I've been to events
where there have been sewing classes, embroidery classes, lacemaking classes,
armor making classes, art exhibits, backgammon tourneys, other-games tourneys,
cooking classes, ad infinitem, but, other than a DANCING event, I've never been
to an event where dance was taught before the feast.  It's certainly something
that could be done outdoors during the spring/summer/early autumn (and dancing
is something that, in many cases, was done outdoor by the peasantry and country
gentry at festivals and fairs).  It would also serve to fill that inevitable
time between when the fighting stops and the feasting begins.  After all,
there's just so many hands that can fit into the kitchen....

Subject: Comments on Pennsic War Rules
Message-Id: <5@sir-alan.UUCP>

His Highness Palymar has asked me to prepare a draft of the rules for Pennsic
XVIII.  These rules will be based on those used at Pennsic XVII (which were
in turn almost completely identical to those used at Pennsic XVI).  Anyone
wishing to comment on last year's rules (either as written or as interpreted
in the field) should send me a note with whatever suggestions you have; I'll
present them to His Majesty.  

These rules will be, of course, only a draft; the final rules must be 
agreed to by both the Kings of the Middle and the East.  I do not expect
any great debate on the conventions of combat but do expect that the War
Points for next year will be different from last year.

I would especially like comments from the scouts and archers, as both
of those groups were affected by the rules at Pennsic XVII.

I will be happy to forward drafts to interested parties as I work on
them; send a request to me at any of the addresses below and I'll add
your name to the mailing list.  It is our hope that the rules will be in
final form and printed in the kingdom newsletters by the spring of next year.

One new rule that will be added is that all kingdoms participating in the War
will be required to supply a proportional number of marshalls.  The Society
manual suggests 1 marshall in 20; we had 13 to marshall the field battle
at XVII with 1200 fighters on the field.

>>
>>Usually, I hear it used by members to refer to themselves or other members,

Major Flame Warning.  

Very few people ever believe that they use the word "mundane" on purpose to 
refer to someone in a belittling fashion.  Nonetheless, people who are not 
SCA'ers (and even some of us who are) find the use of the word "mundane" to be 
very offensive.  The speaker's motivation really has little to do with it, as 
the interpreted meaning by the hearer is what matters to the hearer. 

To continue to use the word after being made aware that your use of it is 
offensive to a number of people shows somewhat of a careless disregard for the 
feelings of these very same "mundanes". 

While I have very little objection to someone referring to my job or home as 
"mundane", I have no objection to them referring to their own job or home as 
"mundane".  But nonetheless, I don't find my home mundane, and even if my job 
is, I don't like to be reminded of it.  The word "mundane" is prejorative in 
20th Century America, even if there are about 50,000 people who would like to 
find it convenient to change that definition to suit their own needs.  

There was a raging discussion on the paganism net this year over the use of 
the word "niggardly" (meaning miserly), and various arguments that debated 
whether the roots of the word had anything to do with the roots of the 
prejorative word "nigger", and whether one should use the word anyway since 
the people who don't know about it may be insulted or offended.  Apparently
the dictionaries mostly favor the Scandinavian root of the word which has
nothing to do with the other word and its root, but there was enough doubt to
make it a lively discussion.  If anyone wants to work out the etymology of the
word "mundane" in order to prove that there is a word which has nothing to do
with the word that I see when I look in the dictionary, I would be interested 
in discussing it.

Another good way to handle this would be to have a set of simple dances
(2 or 3) that everyone is taught - at events (during tourneys and perhaps
with refreshers during dancing) or at meetings.  Alternate between that
set and the more advanced ones.  

The people only interested in the simple dances won't wish to be dancing 
all the time.  The good dancers will enjoy dancing even the simple ones and 
will also get to dance the harder ones - it's always more fun to dance at 
an event than at a weekly practice - I think you'll lose some dancers if you 
don't include the more difficult ones at events.

Tell the ones who are interested in the harder ones when to come to 
practice - or hold teaching sessions during the tourney before the evening 
dancing.  If they're really interested, they'll come.

I think teaching during feast dancing should be avoided at all costs.  It's
not period, and it's boring for everyone, even the ones who are trying to
learn new steps.

Subject: Dancing at Events

I can't say that I have any pat answers to Dani's dilemma. Basically,
you simply have to look over your crowd, get an off-the-cuff estimate
of how many people know how much, and gague your dance teaching
accordingly. If the event is heavily attended from out-Barony, I
usually teach more dances, and lower the average level of the dances
a little bit. If it's almost entirely in-Barony, I feel pretty
comfortable doing less teaching (although I pretty much always do
a substantial amount), since people *should* be attending dance
practice if they don't know the dances. I rarely bother trying to
teach the really complicated dances at events -- at most, I'll give
a quick walk-through for the people who are simply out of practice.

There are two types of events where I do no teaching at all. a) Once
a year (generally) we have a Ball of some sort (usually a themed or
masked Ball in November or a Valentine's Ball (don't tell me it's
not period, please) in February, sometimes both). Since this is
explicitly a ball, I generally assume that people have a pretty good
idea of what they're doing, so I do much less teaching, sometimes
none. (Where "I" is defined as "the current dancemaster"). b) There
is a semi-tradition (ie, with some luck it might become a tradition)
of holding an event in the early summer along the lines that someone
(Karen?) proposed, where dance is taught for the entire afternoon,
with the evening uninterrupted by teaching.

I would say that it is perfectly reasonable to have an entirely non-
teaching dance event, so long as you're upfront about it. The Barony
of the Bridge's Black Rose Ball is traditionally a no-teaching-at-all
event, and is generally quite well attended despite (or, perhaps,
because of) that.

     In order for an award to be given a letter of recomendation needs to be
written saying that you are personally aquainted with the apointee and you
have seen the work they have done and you believe they should receive this
award because.....

     The Royalty can't watch everyone all the time. They can't take
recomendations during the middle of a tournament because 99 times out of
100 they have more important things to be dealing with. Most of the awards
given come from the King and Queen/Prince and Princess siting down with all
the letters of recomendation and going through them.

     If deserving people are being overlooked it is because the King and Queen
are extremely busy people and just need a gentle reminder now and again. Most
kingdoms have in excess of 500 individuals, some of those spread over a vast
portion of country.

     I'm sorry but this just adds another layer of bureucracy to the already
unwieldly amount we're faced with. A vehicle exists whereby members have a 
direct pipeline to their Majesties to see that their peers are well rewarded.
There doesn't need to be another. Write the King or better yet go up and 
introduce yourself at the event. making friends is what this organization
is all about.

I partially disagree. Yes, it could be done this way. However, how are you
going to find partners? Most of the men will be on the tourney field. I am
that the majority of the people who need the practise will not be available.

Sadly, it seems that dancing is very low on most peoples list of priorities.
To be fair, I know that it is low on mine ( and I do dance occaisionally).

                               A letter to the Shire  
 
             I know that I have only been a member for a short time. Yet  
           in the time I have been involved, I have come to the  
           conclusion that there is a small bit of confusion in exactly  
           who has what. More specifically, I am refering to Shire owned  
           equipment, such as books, armor and other assorted equipment.  
 
             I am curious as to exactly where are all these things are  
           now. I recently read through the old Scruglehorns that I had  
           printed and found that we are the proud owners of large  
           numbers of things. One article mentioned that we own a helm  
           that we bought after War and Quest for the Holy Shield. Where  
           is it now? A great example currently is our quest for the  
           sewing machine.  
 
             I would like to ask that at the next meeting everyone who  
           has anything that belongs to the Shire,to speak up and write  
           in on a master list. Then we could see about appointing  
           someone to keep track of all these things. A master list  
           could be drawn up and printed so that people could know what  
           we have available for them to borrow and read. Being our new  
           Chatelaine, I would like to be able to give new comers a list  
           of books to help them become familiar with the society. I  
           hope that this recommendation will be taken seriously, and we  
           will be able to organize ourselves a little better in the  
           future.

                            A History of Hachiro Kasura  
 
             Hachiro was born to English traders in the 12th century,  
           aprrox. the year 1156. When Hachiro was about 2 years old his  
           parents took him along on one of their journies to the Japan.  
           An accident happened on their way though, something happened  
           to the boat and everyone was forced to abandon the ship.  
           Somehow, someone managed to get Hachiro to the shore before  
           they died. He was found on the beach by a Japanese couple and  
           feeling sorry for him they took him in.  
 
             They then taught him in the ways of a Japanese samurai.  
           When Hachiro was but 15 years old, the Tametomo family, long  
           time enemies of the Kasura family, attacked their household  
           without warning. His Japanese father Chinzei, died defending  
           the house. While fleeing the wrath of the Tametomo, his  
           mother was stricken a fatal wound from an arrow. Before she  
           died, she asked him to please leave the country, for she knew  
           that he would never have a life here for the Tametomo would  
           not rest until they had killed all the Kasura.  
 
             Hachiro was familiar with his origins back in the land  
           called England and decided that he would obey his mother and  
           take the next ship he could catch to try and get to this  
           place . He used the money that they had been able to save  
           from their home and soon arrived at his destination.  
 
             Now with little money left to his name, Hachiro is a ronin  
           (masterless samurai) looking to make a life in this his true  
           home.

Good Gentles, I am pleased to announce that, following the demonstration
held By the Barony of Carillon in the Princeton U-Store yard, enough
campus interest has emerged to warrant founding a local chapter.  The
first meeting will be held on Tuesday, November 22 at 8pm.  The location
is 91 Prospect ave, also called Stevenson Hall.  Parking available in
the back.
I also have a request.  Anyone with helpful advice on how to run a
chapter, or what a chapter should do (other than co-ordinate
transportation to Barony events), please let me know.

I can't seem to get away from it here (Canton of Bowman's Rest, EK)!!!
When Lucan von Drachenclaue's crown was taken from him, many of the groups
here in this area were seriously considering seceding from the East Kingdom.
(Never mind that it was the BoD's ruling, not the East Kingdom's...)  The
only reason they refrained was that Randall of the Dark won the crown the
second time Crown Tourney was fought.  This is just one of many examples
of political intrigue that abound in this area.

As to votes, we have them here all the time, usually on the Baronial level.
I actually think it's a good thing when the issue at hand could cause a
major change in the lifestyles of the gentles concerned.  True, it's not
very period, but *some* concessions have to be made.

Well, it's true that the awards are not very period, and that some people
see the awards as being more important than other aspects of the Society,
but for the rest of us, it's nice to be recognized as being good at what
you do!

As the Royalty of the SCA doesn't have the option to give out lands, and
giving out jewelry &c. seems rather expensive (at least to me), awards seem
to be a fairly reasonable alternative.

And although the idea of granting court positions instead of awards is an
attractive one, there are really not enough positions to go around.
Furthermore,  the jockeying for position that abounds now would be magnified
a thousandfold!

Subject: Awards, rank and rewards
Message-Id: <1060@hjuxa.UUCP>

The main problems with awards and the possible rank they confer is the
amount of tradition associated with them. An AoA has meaning within the SCA
that did not exist in period, as far as my limited understanding goes. The
more that we talk about it, the less I understand exactly what it means.

There are clear iniquities in the way in which the recipients are chosen,
ignoring the almost irrelevant factor of the crown's whimsy. On the other
hand, I do not wish to propose a new system. That is mostly because I do
not believe it would be implemented but also because any new system will
have other failings.

Rank also seems to be divorced from what it purports to be. Duke, for example,
is a grand title that conveys nothing more than the statement that the holder
was once a very good fighter. It does not imply the medieval attributes of
a duke, such as a large retinue, great wealth, a company of fighters to
command. Only the title of King has real meaning and that is partly because the holder cannot keep it forever.

Membership of the various orders seems to be more meaningful, but only at
first glance. Pelicans and similar service awards are a reward for work done.
They are not indications that the holders are still slaving away at the same
level that it took to get the awards. The same is true of all awards. I
question wether or not this is right. This time I have a real suggestion.

The Order of the Garter is or was restricted to a certain number of members.
Could we not institute subsets of each of the orders within each kingdom to
be limited to some small number whose membership would be open to change
every six months. The chivalry could allow replacement by challenge but the
other orders would be more difficult to orchestrate.

Writing doesn't work if the crown doesn't visit your group and persuading a
group of non AoA holders to write on behalf of each other is difficult.

Problems with awards is only one symptom of what I think is wrong with the
East Kingdom and going principality will, hopefully, cure more than just the
problem with AoA's.

One of the more common bits of advice to newcomers is "If you want to get to
know nobility, help in the kitchen." The tale of King Victor's turnips is a
prime example.

As to SCAdian and mundane, I have no objection to either word when out of garb
but they do not exist in the language of my persona. If I use them in your
hearing at an event, feel free to castigate me.

Subject: The Mundane Debate

I must agree with milady Capriol.There is no good substitute for the word,
and it is *not* the *word* that is pejorative - it's the meaning behind it.

When I first posted to this group last spring as a (complete) mundane, I
had no problems in applying the label to myself. To me, it was rather on
the order of the condition preceding novice, neophyte, or postulant. This
group responded rather well to a puir mundane's plea for help. As a result
I had an excellent time at my first event, a Crown Tourney.

On the last day, though, I was rather shocked when a lady, asking if I
would come and pipe for some event open to the "public", referred to them
as "mundanes" in a tone of voice that clearly indicated utter disgust. As
one who still considered himself (at least mostly) mundane, I was offended.
Had this been my initial exposure to the SCA, it would also have been my
last.

I must also agree with milady Capriol's remark about treating mundanes as
peasants or commoners. It may be good theatre, but from what I've been able
to ascertain from reading this list, the Society is always on the lookout
for new members. Mistreating them will *not* bring them in. On the other
hand, with the aeternal battles that appear to go on it might be best to
not try to bring in those that would be put off by mere insults! 1/2- :-)

Subject: Dancing at Events:  for whose benefit?

We had our third Harvestfest (dance and entertainment) event last weekend.
There was dancing throughout the day.  Something under half the attendees also
attend dance practices, and tended to know many of the dances.  The rest were
divided into those with no interest in dance, those who wanted their semi-annual
opportunity to dance "Hole in the Wall" and "Official Bransle" but didn't care
for anything exotic, and those who didn't know many dances but were eager to try
new ones.  So which constituencies should be served?  (A mix, obviously, but
where should the emphasis go?)

This problem arises at every event; it was just more salient at Harvestfest than
at most.  Do we do advanced dances?  If they're not taught then people for whom
events are the only opportunity to dance sit out in favor of those who get to
dance the dances every week anyway.  If they are taught -- especially the harder
ones -- half an hour can go by while twenty or thirty bored dancers wait for two
or three novices to pick up the rudiments.  (The problem with skewing things in
favor of those who want to learn the harder dances is that there are always a
few of them ... but *so* few.)

Do we declare that the regular dancers will get their chance every week, and
concentrate on the old standards that everyone can or will do?  To an extent,
but this means boring the people most *interested* in dancing.

At Harvestfest, the decision favored the regular dancers, perhaps more heavily
than should have been the case.  (I'm unsure.)  We got through about three dozen
dances during the day.  (We went through cycles -- of somewhat less than an hour
-- of doing a set of about five dances, breaking for 5-10 minutes, listening to
a couple of entertainment sets (mostly musical), breaking for 5-10 minutes, and
going back to the dancing.  Two of the dance sets were to live music.)  Three or
four dances were just played with no teaching whatsoever.   Another two or three
were walked through quickly, but were restricted to dancers who had done them
before.  As many more were taught at length.  (Don't try to teach a new dance at
an event; it rarely works.)  The vast majority, both hard ones and easy ones,
were taught -- *very* quickly.  Dancers were walked through the steps -- once --
and we relied upon the large core of experienced dancers to keep things moving
in the right direction.

If dancing at events is allowed to become too difficult (or if too little
teaching is done at events) those who don't dance regularly will become
discouraged and/or disgusted.  If more effort goes into serving the occasional
dancers, those who are most interested in dancing will be penalized.  Thoughts
or suggestions?

Greetings my friends!
 
Although I've not been inspired to post anything 
lately I have been listening.I'm just not too
interested in the BOG and all that stuff,  especially
since I'm not willing to do that kind of work 
I don't want to criticize who do.
(In other words thanks to all you people who handle
the day to day running of the organization,allowing me
to enjoy the parts of SCA I joined for.Although
of course, in a crunch  I am at your service)
 
Anyway, let me ask this question, I see and hear 
many references to "the dream",
is this written down,is it a collective dream,
Is one person's dream the same as another's??

"Scadian" is cute, but it is seldom seem west of the Rockies.
Does this make the SCA into (the Empire? of) Scadia?  This can
be taken too far.

The only context in which "Mundane" is really objectionable to me
is when referring to people.  Mundane job and name are useful and
fairly neutral terms.  Instead of using "Mundane" as a noun, try
"people" (which is a very mundane word) and for "Scadians" try
"folk" (or perhaps "Society folk" or "gentle folk" (2 words!))

Remember that if you feel condescending to someone it doesn't matter
what you say; you will still sound condescending.

These are my own opinions, of course.

In fact, there are other titles which have some resemblance to their
medieval usages.  For example, Baron.  A landed baron is to his people
in the SCA today very much a feudal lord.  Many court barons (e.g.,
Steffan ap Cenydd of Silverwing) go to great lengths to be such as
well.  However, it is true that the feudal positions which ought to be
held by Dukes and Counts are generally held by chivalry, Pelicans, and
Laurels, and by heads of households.  After all, what is SCA
apprenticeship and squirehood if not a feudal pact?

That's not really true, Fiacha.  First of all, there is nothing that
says the Crown can only give awards to people present that day.  It's
nice if They can manage it, but if an award is truly overdue, then the
Crown will find some way of giving it.  For example, the King may
direct your Baron to give certain AoA's in His absense.  It's been
done.  Of course, all this is also a real good argument to get people
travelling to events outside their own barony.  It is certainly true
that if you never leave your own group, you are not going to get wide
recognition.

Secondly, anyone can write to recommend awards.  Anyone.  And,
furthermore, anyone who is an active member should feel it his dut to
do so each reign.  It takes about 20 minutes to write a letter
recommending a half-dozen AoA's.

Good cheer!

Message-Id: <6679@spool.cs.wisc.edu>

One of my favorite activities at an event is the dancing. I can't make
dancing practice regularly, however, so I tend to know only a few dances.
I find learning the dances during the dances to be awkward, as the practiced
become bored and the novices feel clumsy. 

Something that may or may not be possible is to have a dance practice
sometime during the afternoon of an event at which the dancing will be
in the evening after the feast. I have only been to a few events, but most
of them have consisted of a tourney of some sort followed by a feast, then
dancing. While the tourney is going on a dance practice could be held,
as a change of pace from watching the tourney.

In My Humble Opinion.....

(Disclaimer - this in no way represents anybodys opinion, except mind and is
 not an offical position of the SCA INC. nor any of it's attendent bodies.)

     This pretty well sums up my opinion on the issue of awards. It's taken 
from a play entitled _The Kingdom of the Hundred Acre Wood_ and will be
seen at the West Kingdom 12th Night and An Tir 12th Night.

Act II - The Reign of Pooh Bear

Kanga - Where is Rabbit off to?

Pooh - I guess he's forgotten a rule or two. Or maybe he has a new award to 
      think up. Rabbit is awfully clever with awards.

Kanga - How many awards has Rabbit thought up?

Pooh - Rabbit has thought up many awards, an award for everyone and sometimes
      two. Rabbit likes awards and rules.

Kanga - Why?

Pooh - Rabbit says that rules help keep order and that if everyone knows the 
      rules to something everyone can play because they're all following the 
      same guidelines. It is all very confusing to me.

Kanga - And awards?

Pooh - Rabbit says that awards are necessary so that people know that their 
      efforts are appreciated. Rabbit has an award for every type of service.

Roo - Even Squires?

Pooh - He has three for squires.

Tigger - And knights?

Pooh - Oh there are many more for knights.

Kanga - Are these awards really necessary?

Pooh - Rabbit seems to think so. Rabbit and Owl have been very busy writing 
      rules and thinking up awards to help us remember these special days.

Kanga - But if these days are so special, why do they need awards to be
       remembered by?

Narrator - And with that, Kanga and Pooh fell silent, and the others fell 
          silent with them because what Kanga said had a lot in it, that
          Special Days with Special Friends are always remembered even long
          after the awards have been misplaced or lost or forgotten.

Personally I don't use the word "mundane" in a belittling fashion, nor does
any one else that I know. It is simply a useful word to refer to the
commonplace, real world.

Usually, I hear it used by members to refer to themselves or other members,
in their everyday guise. How does this produce an "us-them" mentality?

Hello, again

        Recently Alfgar tells us that SCAdian _is_ a derogatory term thought
up by the Markland folks (none of whom has ever drawn on me or been anything
less than polite, but I have only met a few dozen of them).  Fine.  So the
word Yankee was also originally meant as a derogatory term by the British.  I
happen to consider myself a Yank.  Such words are only insulting if you choose
to be insulted.  Certainly I don't mean to insult anyone by the use of such
terms, nor am I insulted by them (even when someone asks me if I read Sci-Fi).
Maybee I just don't insult easily . . . and maybe that's a good thing.

Subject: Rulership in the SCA
Message-ID: <881115044535.10.CONS.ELF@AIDA.UU.SE>

Good gentles, here is another firebrand...

The tradition of the SCA is clearly not democratic. We take pride in having a
system of rulership which is as close to the real Middle Ages as we can get.
Therefore we are ruled by Kings and Princes. Since we want to give more than
one person the opportunity to rule, we change rulers every six months. Since
democracy isn't period, we elect our rulers by combat. Further, the tradition
in most parts of the SCA is tas the ruler has absolute power during his reign.
He can make and abolish laws as he sees fit, the only limits being Corpora
and BOD decisions.

There are two questions that need to be answered in connection with our system
of rulership (as it is implemented in most parts of the Society):

1. Does it work well?
2. Is it "period"?

The answer to the first question is that absolute monarchy is of course the best
system of government, as long as the ruler is omniscient, benevolent to all
subjects, and infallibly wise. Unfortunately, such people don't exist.

While most of our rulers are essentially good folks who do their best to serve
the Dream, and some rulers are truly GREAT, the exceptions which do occur will
make a lot of damage. There are examples of rulers who have abused their powers
to strike at individuals they didn't like. Unwise laws have been created against
the wishes of the populace. Those who set themselves up as examples of chivalry
and courtesy are sometimes dishonest and clearly unfit for the office they at-
tained through their skill att arms.

Perhaps bad reigns are something we can learn to live with, as long as they are
exceptions. But I firmly believe that some limits on royal power would benefit
the Society. This does not mean that I want democracy! Heaven protect us from
organized factions, political intrigue and votes. But there *are* other ways
to safeguard against royal deficiencies, without making it less fun to rule.

The answer to the second question is a flat "no". There were no absolute
monarchies in the Middle Ages.

Medieval society contained two opposing theories of power. The "ascending"
theory stated that the power to create laws rests in the people. The ruler(s)
have no other power than that given to them by the people. This was the pre-
valiling theory in ancient Greece, Republican Rome and some Germanic tribes.

The "descending" theory stated that all power comes from one supreme being and
descends to the governed people. Office holders are merely delegates of the
supreme ruler. Consent plays no role. This theory prevailed during the Roman
Empire and continued to exist in medieval society. The Roman emperors were
divine and needed no higher authority to rest their power on. Christian rulers,
in order to preserve their right to rule, became the representatives of God.

But if one representative of God had made a law, how could the next one change
it? That would imply that God had changed his mind, which was unthinkable. The
customs of the past could only be contested by setting them against a past more
venerable still. In this traditionalist ideology, all changes in the law were
seen as evil. The rulers themselves, when creating laws, claimed that they were
not changing it, but merely interpreting it. At the same time, medieval law was
very flexible. The feudal age changed very quickly and profoundly while be-
lieving itself to be unchanging.

The greater part of medieval law was not "written law" (royal dictates) but
"common law", i.e. traditions and customs handed down from the past. While
medieval theory mostly upheld the descending theory, it can be effectively
demonstrated that it was only a fiction. Things never worked that way.

Two quotes to illuminate the point:

Henri de Bracton, English 13th century lawyer: "That is law which has been
justly determined and approved, with the counsel and assent of the great men,
the approval of the whole commonwealth, and the authority of the King."

Alfred the Great: "Then I, King Alfred, gathered them (the laws) together and
ordered to be written many of the ones that our forefathers observed - those
that pleased me; and many of the ones that did not please me I rejected with
the advice of my councillors, and commanded them to be observed in a different
way. For I dared not presume to set down in writing at all many of my own, since
it was unknown to me what would please those who would come after us."

To summarize: I believe that the best and most period system we can have is one
where Kings and Princes cannot make or change laws without the consent of a
curia consisting of all Great Officers of state and all resident Peers. This
would still leave a lot of power for the ruler, e.g. to appoint officers,
give awards and orders, to command in war and to preside and lead in peace.

Subject: Scadians and Mundanes

It has been my observation that many SCA'ers refuse to stop calling people 
mundanes even when requested on separate occasions (or by other SCA'ers).  
Many people regard this an insulting and derogatory.  The person whom I knew 
who first gave me an outsiders view of the SCA also called them Scadians.  
This was back in 1978.  As a result, I developed the habit, just as I 
developed the habit of calling non-SCA'ers mundanes.  It just happens that I 
believe that "mundanes" have a better reason to be upset (due to the 
dictionary) about being called mundane than SCA'ers have about being called 
Scadians.  It is also certainly true that over 90% of the Marklanders // Orcs 
// Yelmsvikings that I've met are much more polite (both in word and in tone 
of voice) about the SCA than the reverse.  Actually, more than a plurality of 
SCA'ers that I know speak of Markland with at least some derision.  After 
spending some time with them, I was reasonably impressed by their hard work 
and methodology, though I have never gone so far as to join them due to real 
life considerations. 

As a result, I will cheerfully stop referring to "Scadians" in the presence of 
anyone who also relinquishes the term "mundane".

Subject: Awards, respect, and Capriol

Ah, yes -- the inequities of awards. A favorite subject here in the East, where
many are talking about splitting into Principalities for just that reason. Ok,
here's an opinion from a member of the great peasantry :-). Be warned that this
is one of my patented digressions, although a little less flame-bouyant than
some.

There is something wrong with the way that we handle awards in the Society. No,
I don't mean that it's too hard to get them. On the contrary, there is
altogether too much emphasis placed upon them. For example:

About, oh, a year ago, several of my friends received their AoA's. Now, they
are good people, quite active in the Society in various ways, and well
deserving of their awards. However, I started thinking, "Hurrumph. I've done
far more service to the Society than they. It's really awful that they got
theirs before I got mine." Within a few weeks, I found myself actually 
beginning to resent *them* for it. Fortunately, I sat down and gave myself a
good mental slapdown before this went any further. And yet...

I see this happening a lot. I've seen people actually begin to sour on the
Society because they haven't gotten an award that they feel they deserve.
Awards seem to be treated by a great many people as merit badges of a sort:
after you've done such-and-so amount of service, you should expect to get
your induction into the Order of the Hippo, or some such. 

The problem with this is that they *aren't* merit badges, doled out by some 
impartial authority, who watches carefully over each member so that it may 
give them their due as soon as they earn it. Awards are fundementally
political. This isn't anything wrong, but the simple reality is that, until
someone *notices* one's work, and points it out to the Royalty, that work
is not going to be recognized. Which is, quite frankly, period.

Is there anything wrong with this system? Well, not really, except that
many people don't seem to see the system as it is. I see so many people
working *towards* an award, rather conspicuously so. And I have to ask,
Why? Is the bloody piece of paper such a status symbol in the Society that
it becomes peoples' main objective? It certainly shouldn't be, yet, in
many cases, people seem to think that it is.

What should change? If anything, I'd say that AoA's should be harder to
get. As one friend puts it, "So many people get their awards, and I find
myself saying, 'Why?'. Instead, when someone gets an award, I should be
saying, 'Well, it's about time'." To those who haven't yet gotten awards
that you feel you deserve: Mellow out. It's far more fun to watch people
saying, "You don't have your OHip yet? My God, why not?". Awards, even
Peerages, are a dime a dozen in a Society that has something like 50
thousand members in it. *Respect*, on the other hand, is precious. Work
towards that, and the awards will come in their due time.

(Oh, yes, those who keep replying to "Capriol": read the message again. The
missive is from Malice, aka Lady Maria von Morgenrot. Capriol is the
speaker in the quote at the bottom, from "Orchesography", one of our main
sources of period dance and manners.)

feast-o-crat
hm.
as was pointed out to me (hi Bob) a feastocrat is a feast that rules, and, 
although the society might be described as a feastocracy, te feastocrat is 
obviously either a turkey or a cooked goose. I have never felt the need for a 
title for the position of running the kitchen for an event, 'running the 
kitchen' doesnt have many more sylables than 'kitchen autocrat' and seems more 
accurate than 'head cook'.  Since running an SCA kitchen is not a period 
activity, (no one needs to talk to the person running it in a period context) 
it does not need a period title in the way that the offices connectd with 
serving do (butler, panter, sewer, ewerer).

I have exactly one use for the word 'scadian' and that is to put on government 
forms asking for my ethnicity.  Otherwise i tend to use 'society' or 'society 
member' and let context tell which society i meen (wonderfull thing, context).
As for 'Mundane', I like the word.  it means exactly what we want it to, and 
there is no good substitute in english.  The Swedish 'utgard' (off-world? 
out-world? extra-mundane?) seems to mean exactly the opposite.  The french 
word is 'quotidien' (donne-nous notre pain quotidien), but 'everyday' or 
'daily' just isnt the same.  I once suggested 'diurnal' but was promptly 
squashed.  
the reason 'mundane' sounds pejorative and "us-them" is that we have a 
pajorative and us-them attitude towards mundanes (digression:  I do *not* 
approve of treating the observers at demonstrations as commoners or peasants 
no matter how they are dressed.  It is undoubtedly good theater, and may well 
reflect the attitudes of the period (tirent lo blanc was a right ## and no 
mistake) but it is not what we are trying to recreate in the SCA.  We (in 
theory) treat all members as if they are at least gentle, if not noble, unless 
they make it clear that they wish to be treated otherwise, and even then most 
of us treat them with courtesy most of the time.  We should treat our guests 
with no less consideration.  We should certainly not make comments about their 
garb or in any other way try to make them feel as inferiors or outsiders.

Greetings to my lady Cher de Belview
I understand your arguments completely.  I had, however, an argument of my own 
to make, and thought it would do no harm to take one statement out of context 
while making it clear that was what i was doing. my appologies for any 
missunderstanding.

New argument addressed to the populace at large:
The immediate corralary to my argument, which Arval has so neatly pointed out,
that one should take up one's quill and WRITE, WRITE, WRITE, was, i thought, 
too obvious to be worth putting down.  wrong agian.  going principality seems 
to me to be a very large hammer with which to crack a rather small nut.  Our 
barony has several very hard-working but somewhat self-efacing (Even our baron
has not noticed some of them ( he doesn't run kitchens very often)) people.  
So in all likely hood, does yours, even if you live in trimaris.  
unless your royalty are autocrats, they likely wont notice either.

Greetings!

Just for the sake of argument, I would point out that it is not
uncommon at all in the real world for a nation to end up being
generally known by a derogatory term in someone else's language.  Look
how many tribes and nations have names which mean "the enemy" or "the
barbarians" in their neighbor's tongue.  For example, "Scottish"
derives from a Latin term for "raider," "Viking" is an Old Norse term
for "raider", and think how many SCa members describe themselves as
"barbarians", a term which derives from the Greek word for "somebody
too stupid to speak Greek" (freely translated).  Thus, SCAdian is a
perfectly typical name for our culture, as is mundane for that other
one.  The only way to come up with a better name is to find a name for
our Known World, and form an adjective off of that.  For example, I
wouldn't mind calling the world of the 12 Kingdoms "The Imperium" (BoD
forbid!), and calling ourselves "Imperials".  Of course, that's slightly
pompous...

Greetings!

This discussion seems to be turning around to "philosophy of awards",
on which topic I have some thoughts.  I should point out to start that
my opinions are decidedly Eastern, and I have found great variation in
the underlying philosophy of awards in other Kingdoms.  I would,
indeed, be interested to hear foreign points of view.  If I ramble a
bit, bear with me, or demand clarification, because I really do
consider this an important topic.

This letter will begin with a possibly tedious discussion of
philosophy, which many might want to skip.  If so, jump ahead to the
line of ********, because after that, I want to make a suggestion to
which I really would like to hear reactions.  Thanks.

I see great flaws in our system of awards in the SCA.  First, and most
fundamentally, it has very little to do with the Middle Ages.  (I am
not going to address the somewhat bizarre meanings and ranks we
associate with titles like Baron, Count, Knight, and so on.  It's been
done to death, and there's nothing to be done about it anyway.)
"Orders" and cermonial awards existed in period, but they had a very
different meaning than we assign them.  We (the SCA) have a
multiplicity of awards, with narrow, specific meanings, which are
given to individuals as recognition of their service in specific
fields.  This sort of award is not found in Europe, to my knowledge,
until the Victorian period.  A medieval King had AN order of
knighthood, into which individuals were inducted for whatever reason
the King saw fit.  In England, that order was the Garter, in France,
the Estoile, in Anjou, the Crescent, and so on.  These recognitions
existed separate from any notion of nobility and rank, and were great
honors, personal recognition from the sovereign for the highest
service.  The SCAdian awards system is almost a collection of merit
badges.  In many kingdoms, there is very little correspondance between
orders for different skills, and the connection between rank and
orders is intimate.  

This "merit-badge syndrome" points out another major problem with our
award system: over-specialization.  The existance of too many awards
leads to confusion.  Artisans in one field, eager to win recognition,
concentrate on their own specialty, and, with too many awards to keep
track of, loose sight of the relative rank of other orders.  Awards
become little more than guild-rankings, granted from within a small
commumity, and mostly ignored from outside.  The purpose of Kingdom
awards ought to be to give an individual Kingdom-wide recognition.
For example:  As Brigantia Principal Herald, I have received
essentially the highest available recognition in my own
specialty.  A Kingdom order for heralds would have no extra meaning,
since I already have tangible evidence that I have the respect of the
heralds of my Kingdom.  On the other hand, when I was inducted into
the Kingdom service order, the Silver Crescent, I was deeply moved.
This award was a demonstration that I had earned that same respect
from everyone who serves the East: chirurgeons, seneschals, autocrats,
NOT just the heralds.  In too many cases, a specialty award achieves
no real meaning or respect outside its own circle, and, all too often,
becomes a political bone.  I see an important place for guild awards in
the SCA, which I will get to later, but not special-purpose Kingdom
awards. 

Historically, the East has tried to minimize the number of orders.  To
my mind, the idea has been this:  If a Kingdom has a few, broadly-
defined orders, then they tend to be easily understood by the
populace, they may be awarded flexibly, and they will be generally
given the respect due their rank.  For example, the three major orders
of peerage (Laurel, Pelican, Chivalry), being universal in the
Society, are seen by everyone is basically the same light.  For the
most part, an artisan in Caid considers a Pelican from the Middle to
rank with the local Laurel (for the most part).  A chirurgeon
inducted into the Pelican in An Tir will consider a scribe and Pelican
from Atlantia to be his equal.  The East has generally managed to
replicate this structure on the Kingdom level, with a single set of
Kingdom-level awards.  Up until 4 or 5 years ago, there were three
such awards, roughly corresponding to the three peerages.  In the last
few years, we have added one for Archery. There are also a collection
of minor awards, but they are widely viewed as special interest
recognitions.  Awards in the East tend to be hard to earn, mostly
because all the major orders are polling orders, and so to receive the
support of the order, one must be well-known Kingdom-wide.  Some
consider this a disadvantage, others consider it the great strength of
the Eastern award system.  However, since there are generally few
different awards given out, most people have a clear picture of how
they rank relative to one another, and the Kingdom High Orders of
Merit rank equally both on paper and in the popular mind.


************************

I think we need to think about the Middle Ages.  Medieval nobles
didn't hand out pretty scrolls and medallions; they gave rank, land,
wealth.  They gave STUFF.  I think we need to de-emphasize awards as
the primary means of recognition, and concentrate on the public
recognition and reward given by a feudal lord to his vassals.
Largesse is one of the prime virtues of chivalry, and I think it
should be the prime virtue of the SCA noble.  If the King (or Baron or
Knight or Great Officer or Guild Master) feels He has been well-served
by a subject, He should reward him in some tangible way.  Beautiful
scrolls are an excellent example, but they are only one example.  If
the Queen notes a fighter as a shining example of chivalry on the
field, She might give him a ring or a stone to wear as a token of Her
esteem  (Queen Embla of the East made a common practice of such
rewards).  If a King finds himself indebted to a fighter for his 
gallantry on the field of war, he might reward that fighter by naming
him "Royal Standard Bearer", or by granting him the right to display
His personal badge on the field (King Morgan Sheridan so rewarded one
gentle in his second reign).  If a Baron considers one of his
people deserving of recognition for long service in the kitchens of
the barony, he might name that gentle "Baronial Cupbearer" (Most
barony's have a few such positions, and I understand some Kingdoms
have them, too.  Good for you!).  Personally, I think that the more
personal and spontaneous the recognition, the more deeply it will be
appreciated.   Every King should have a Privy Council, and it should
be a great honor to be named to that select body.  "Groom of the Privy
Chamber" was an exalted title in the court of Henry VIII.  Such
positions could even be made hereditary, as the ultimate reward.
Imagine, for example, being granted the right to act as "Queen's
Cupbearer", AND to name the next holder of that title, forever!  I
would consider that a deep honor.

The SCA is probably too deeply committed to our system of awards and
rank to radically change it now, but we should try to separate rank
from reward.  The King grants rank, as is proper, but it is not the
only form of recognition available.  It is the right and duty of any
nobleman to reward his vassals for service well done.  It is, I
believe, the heart of the Society, and our Kings must not be allowed
to forget it.

And trite though it may seem, I sign myself,

In Service to the Society,

	Arval.

Subject: Atlantia Crown Tourney

The victor of Atlantean Crown Tournament this past weekend was Duke Michael
of Bedford, fighting for Lady Seaonid (aargh, I've drawn a blank on correct
spelling and the rest of her name - and I've known her for years...)
The runner-up was Duke Richard Corwyn of Oldcastle.

It was the first Crown Tourney I've seen in this kingdom, and I had a good
time.  It was unusual to see a list (of 22 fighters) in which all the
entrants were either royal peers or unbelted, i.e. no chivalry that weren't
also royal peers.  The day ran smoothly, the weather good, if a little bit
chilly, and a good time was had by all (I think).

Subject: More spears [non fighters may want to skip]

Well, since Bart brought me up, I'll add my two cents in.  When using a
spear in melee combat, I like a dagger hanging from my wrist.  The lanyard
is of such a length that I can snap my hand down quickly and the dagger
jumps into it - kind of like catching quarters off your elbow.  (If you
don't know this game, I'm sure there is an someone at your corner bar
that will be happy to teach it to you - loser buys the drinks)  I tried a
mace, but found it didn't work for me.  First of all, I'm not very big
(5'4") and I tend to fight from a pretty low crouch - the mace was big
enough that it kept banging against my front knee.  More of a problem was
the weight - I fight melee spear with the right side forward, and wanted
the mace in my right hand.  This meant that my right arm was not only
targeting the spear, it was also supporting the mace.  Since my arm is
often at full extension, this got tiring very quickly.  So, I went to a
dagger.  I figured that if it ever got to the point that I really needed
it, I was likely to be quickly dead no matter what I was carrying as a
backup weapon, so the difficulty of getting a kill with a dagger wouldn't
matter much.  As it has turned out, I'm happy with my choice - once someone
starts to try to run me down, they are often surprised enough to have me
stop backpedaling and start charging (with spear held vertically to block)
that I have a chance to get the little pokey in.
  While in the Middle kingdom (no face thrusts) I'd fight single combat
spear (against another spear - I'm not suicidal) in a stance with the
spear angled from low at the tip to high at the butt.  Low is defined as
opponent's waist or lower, high is my own head or higher.  This allows for
lots of blocking capability, and allows a kind of twisting thrust attack
as the rear hand comes down and forward.  Since we don't want to come near
the face, this stance helps avoid a wild block becoming a thrust in that
area.  I haven't tried spear since I moved to Atlantia this summer, so
I don't _know_ what differences permitting a face thrust will make, but my
_guesses_ (read what I'm going to try) include using a basic stance that
keeps the tip pointing at my opponent's face, and trying lots of long range
poking at the face.
  One thing I don't think I've seen anyone mention is the use of shield
hooks on a spear.  They are very useful in melee, especially if two
spearmen and a few shieldmen practice together - if one spear plans to
reach out and hook opponent's shields, they can be pulled out of position
long enough for someone to get a good shot at the guy whose shield was
grabbed.  It takes lots of practice, and does give people more to grip if
they are minded to get into a tug of war match with you and your spear,
but I think the hooks are worth it.
  Um, Bart was right, we do tend to go on, don't we... <| ) [smiley in helm]

I couldn't agree more. Sadly, my impression of the East Kingdom is that there
are too many groups that do not get to meet the king for years on end and so
contain large numbers of unrewarded role models. As seneschal, I feel that I
have a duty to try to get as many awaards as possible for the members of the
Barony. My feeling is that no less than 6 deserving people were overlooked
when Gavin and Sedalia passed through and that one person that was rewarded
was less worth than most of the six.

Thus I have to ask, "Does an AoA mean anything?" If role models are only
rarely and erratically identified this way, then this is a poor way of
recognizing them. On the other hand, it is clear that the awards are not
going to the outstanding role models.

I find it hard to believe that the uneven distribution of what is the most
common award will be cured until the ratio of awarders to potential awardees
is radically adjusted.

I would like to hear any suggestions as to how to correct this. I'll listen
to suggestions that my world view is wrong and I won't even sulk.

Good day, Fiacha!

  I won't argue that there aren't people out there who deserve awards
& don't get them, and your (subtle?) reference to the value of having
territorial Princes to take care of oversight is not a bad one.
However, there is one simple expedient which will work in the mean
time: Recommendation letters.  Lots of 'em.  You don't have to be a
peer, a seneschal, a baron, or anything at all in order to write the
King & Queen and say "Gee, Snulbugga the Fairhaired really ought to
get his Order of the Unlaced Boot because of all the nify work he's
done in our barony.  Why, just last month he..."  Everyone should
write these letters, and I can promise you: Any King who gets twelve
letters recommending someone for an award of arms will give it.  So,
organize local folk in a letter-writing campaign.  Talk to people from
neighboring groups.  Don't let the King forget to whom he owes
recognition.  

It works.

Really.

	Arval.

The groups in Ohio that use the designation March(e) are almost exclusively
part of the Barony of the Middle Marches. These were set up this way as
a "border buffer" between the Middle and East Kingdoms. The Barony is one
of the oldest in the Middle kingdom (Around A.S. 4) and started with that
designation without any SCA-wide definition in place.

 Good Gentles,

I have noticed several requests in hope of finding aid in locating someone in
another Kingdom.  Finally, I myself have decided that perhaps there are some
gentles somewhere who could help me.

I met a gentleman at Pennsic this year who wished me to have his address. 
However, the gentle who was supposed to give me his address has lost it.
Therefore, I am going to you, good gentles of the net, in hopes of locating
it.

The gentleman I am looking for is Vicount Sir Elric (sp?) of Atenvelt, 
particularly the Principality of the Sun (not sure if that is right--anyhow,
Arizona).  I would be most appreciative if someone could email me his address
or that of someone who could get it for me.

Thank you good gentles, in advance, for your assistance.

I remain,
In Service to the Dream,

Unfortunately, my previous posting seems to have been eaten (due to my not
knowing the system, apparently...)

I, too, do not like the term "SCAdian" or the term "SCA" (as opposed to 
"S.C.A."). It seems that Anachronist or better, Medievalist are better,
although not exceptional. None of these is all that bad, though, as they are
terms we accept among ourselves.

The term I really hate is "Nubies" (or "New-bies" or whatever spelling variant
is being used by the perpetrator), to refer to new members or recruits to the
SCA. It seems very derogatory to me. (Oh, don't mind him, his one of the
Nubies.) Maybe it's just me, but I would prefer a term such as "Novice" anyday.
Is this a term used generally, or just locally/regionally, anyway?

This is the oldest inhabitant speaking. As I recall, "Scadia" and
"Scadian"
originated in the discourse and publications of the Markland Medieval
Mercenary Militia (or whatever it stands for ths week). They
definitely
did mean it to be derogatory (their idea of good clean fun was to draw
on
someone they found out was an SCA member). When I hear people who
insist
on using this, it falls on me the same way that (to use an
illustration
which might get the point across) a true SF fan feels at people who
insist
on calling his hobby "sci-fi".

The TREE OF BATTLES, of Honore Bonet, was the recognized textbook of
what
would now be called "international law". As such, it has much to deal
with
feudal obligations, code of honor, etc. Much of it incorporates
previous
works by the legalist Giovanni of Legnano, the canonist St. Raymond of

Penafort, and many more.
 In writing on the law of war, Bonet is most inclusive, taking in:
 SPIRITUAL WAR
   Universal Spiritual War-- between the angelic hosts.
   Particular Spiritual War-- in each soul.
  CORPOREAL WAR -- 
    Universal Corporeal War-- What we usually call by the word.
    Particular Corporeal War --
      in defense of one's body -- i.e., the law of self-defense.
      in defense of a mystical body -- the law of reprisals (as in
"marque
and reprisal).
      in defense of honor -- law of duel and trial by battle.--

Greetings unto all!

I should like to offer up Sir Tetsuo Sakura's "classic definition of a
pandybat"  (this is in the same sense as "the classic definition of
chutzpah").   I hope Baron Seamus' very close friend Jutte-sama will take
especial note, as this is his daimyo speaking:

"Well, I _almost_ had him when the corkscrew caught in his armor, and then I
fell on the flail..."

It is worth noting that Sir Tetsuo has also been known to describe the
"ultimate SCA doorshield" as being constructed of 3/4 inch plywood, 6-7 feet
in height, 3-4 feet in width, with a vertical slot and a horizontal slot to
facilitate use of a weapon, and on wheels to facilitate movement.

Subject:  A REPLY TO CAPRIOL

Greetings unto all!

The gentle who signed as Capriol was taking exception to a part of my remarks
of I-forget-exactly-when in the course of the discussions on AoA's and
membership.  The phrase in question was "leadership figures," i.e. it's the
leadership types who get the goodies.

Now, that phrase was just what I wanted at the time in order to get my
thoughts across (and sorry, Capriol, but I think it was _very_ much to the
point).  I _would_ like to split hairs just a tad in my own defense and point
out that one _can_ regard "a good role model" as being synonymous with "a
leadership figure" in the sense of setting a good example, which is largely
what I had in mind.

However, with respect to the subject of awards _per se_ a by far more
appropriate description would have been "...good role models..." or "those who
serve, period."

And by damn, they also serve who act as kitchen drudges, gate guards, and the
like.  Too often, because they don't stand out they are too easily overlooked.
In this, Capriol is quite right, and I whole-heartedly agree.  Thankfully, in
Trimaris we try to be aware of such gentles, and to see that they too get the
recognition they deserve.  I hope the same is true throughout the Knowne
Worlde.

Thank you.

I must disagree here.  I, too, would just as happy to see words like
"SCAdian" go away, but we do need some way to refer to us and them.
If "SCAdian" and "mundane" aren't to be used, what do you suggest
instead?  I object to "real-world", since that implies that we aren't
real (Remember: reality is just an escape for people who can't deal
with their own fantasies!).  I usually use "SCAfolk" instead of
"SCAdians", but I rather like "mundane".  It has that nice mixture of
joking and looking-down-yer-nose that is found in words like "goyim".

RE: the name Olwen

Milord Arval Brigantia, you ask for sources for the name Olwen. I can only
tell you that the name does not occur in Tolkien's books (to my knowledge).
There is an elf named Olwe, perhaps that was what you thought of.

RE: obnoxious words

I follow with interest the discussion about various SCA-related words.
"SCAdian" is a word I find repulsive, particularly if it's used in front
of spectators at a demo. Why not call ourselves "medievalists" or "lords
and ladies", or "anachronists"?
I once saw a very nice equestrian/medieval show at Warwick castle, where
a knight displayed his various skills on horseback. This guy made a point
of addressing the spectators as peasants. He was the knight, they were
villein who were graciously given permission to watch a member of the
nobility at work. This might be a good idea for SCA demos! If it's done
with tact, it can acheive a nice effect: anyone in garb is obviously a
lord or lady, the mundanes are just commoners since they are dressed as
such.
I can't see anything wrong with the word "mundane". Among Tolkienists,
the terminology is usually based on the Old Norse myths, where the gods
live in "Asgard", humans live in "Midgard" (Middle-earth), and the giants
live in "Utgard". Thus, since the Tolkienists are in Middle-earth, all
others are "Utgardians". But it sounds better in Swedish than in English.

The word "autocrat" is so established by custom that I really don't
think there is any way to remove it. What we *could* do is try and invent
better words for "feast-crat" and all those other "crats".
By the way, did you know that "autokrator" (autocrat) is the Greek word
for "emperor"?!

For anyone interested in the offices connected with medieval households,
I recommend the book "A History of Private Life", vol 2: "Revelations of
the Medieval World" by Georges Duby (editor). ISBN 0-674-39976-5.
A *most* interesting book, truly a revelation.

RE: Manuals of Courtesy
Anybody interested in the post-medieval concept of chivalry and courtesy
will enjoy the book "The Return to Camelot" by Mark Girouard, ISBN 0-300-
02739-7. This tells the story of the rebirth of the ideals of chivalry
in the late 18th century and up to World War II. It demonstrates clearly
that the SCA is not the first group of starry-eyed romantics who long for
the days of yore...

She's not in the range you mention, but real close (1047-???? the 1047 date
refer's to the arival of her husband to the southern Italian scene)  The
woman is Sichelgaita, a Lombard princess, and wife of Robert Guiscard.
Robert died in 1085, I'm sure Sichelgaita was still around afterword, the
book I'm getting this information from doesn't mention what she did after
Robert died, but I doubt she just sat around....doesn't sound like that
kind woman at all.  As for what she did...the book says that she participated
fully in the wars and politics of her era.  This includes accompaning Robert
into many wars.  (At least half a dozen are mentioned)  The book is Medieval
Europe, A Short History by C. Warren Hollister and doesn't say a whole lot
more than what I've mentioned, it concentrates mainly on Robert, it generally
only says that Sichelgaita was with him, I assume fighting and strategizing.

Subject:  re:pet peeves, words, and suchstuff

Greetings all & sundry (esp. sundry)

        Since people seem to be on the subject I figure I'll put in my 2 cents.
I can understand in some ways the problem some people have with words like
autocrat, feast-o-crat, mundane, SCAdian, etc.  They don't belong (with the
*possible* exception of autocrat) at SCA events or demos.  Neither, on the
other hand do the words computer, shrink (as noun not verb), or Amtrak.
A herald at a demo should not refer to us as SCAdians - nor should anyone
_at_an_event_ want to know about my "mundane" job or "mundane" address.
However, these words are part of the vocabulary of the SCA inc - the people
who go to SCA dance practices, fighting practice, and other "non-persona"
activities and who live in the 20th century.  They are the jargon we use and
are not meant to be insulting - just easy to use.  For example, count the
sylables in these sentences:

1. I know a SCAdian whose mundane job is parking cars.

2. I know one of the gentle folk of the Society whose job in the real world
        is parking cars.

        In my opinion the first sentance is by far the better as long as the
special-use vocabulary is commonly known among the people who would be saying
or hearing the sentence (which it is).

        Similarly, we use the word autocrat all the time and perhaps the
phrase Master Of The Revels would better enhance the ambiance at events -
in fact I think that would be grand - but outside events why use a phrase
when a word will do the job as well?

        Finally, I have only very seldom heard the words feast-o-crat or
List-o-crat as we usually use MOL outside,and List Mistress at, our events
and don't really have a word for the person in charge of the kitchens.


        Just my opinions, and any resemblace of these opinions to other
opinions living or dead is purely coincidental.

                Your Servant,

Subject:  AUTOCRATS

Greeting unto the net!

Regarding the term "autocrat" and its _ad nauseum_ variations:  I think it
should be remembered that, like so much of our sub-culture, the term was a
spur-of-the-moment, by-accident creation.  (NOTE:  I heard the story from Duke
Siegfried von Hoflieshkeit at the TYC; anyone who wants to hear it can contact
me.)  Nobody gave a thought to its future use because no one realized there
was to be such a future!  And like many such accidents of history, it has not
only stuck, it has become so deeply engrained as to make change difficult.
Some of us may not _like_ the term, but we _all_ know what it means.

There are a couple of benefits to "autocrat" and its attendant
bastardizations.  For example, "feastcrat" may not be elegant, but it
communicates an awful lot in a small space.  And the term is one of the few
used uniformly throughout the Knowne Worlde.

Please note:  I am _not_ saying that one should not use substitute phrasing
where possible.  I am merely trying to add a little perspective to the
discussion.

As for "Steward" and "mundane":  I think the both terms are extremely
appropriate, as the former is both period and suitable to our use of it; and
the latter certainly applies in the dictionary sense when comparing reality to
the Dream.

"SCAdian", I don't like. But, I can see how it happened.

Thank you.

While the term autocrat never really bothered me, I have to agree that the
feast-o-crat and list-o-crat terms are obnoxious. Why folks insist on making
up ugly words when a term exists is a puzzlement (to quote Yul Brenner :-).

The local group tends to avoid this admirably. We use the novel terms
"head cook" or "Isobel is in charge of the Kitchen" for feast-o-crat.
For list-o-crat, we use "Mistress of the Lists," "The Marshal in Charge,"
or, usually, "Bart" (;-). See, isn't that easy?

The made up word that bugs the beejeesus out of me, though, is SCAdian.
Pronounced with the first 'a' long. Argg! Where did this come from?!?!
For some reason, people around here insist on using it. It sounds especially
bad to me in public anouncements at demos. It is one of the few things that
I actively discourage.

Scene: Morning before a demo.
Actors: Marshal (me), Herald (a notorious offender)

M: Look, this is a Demo. I'm gonna tell the fighters that so they'll fall
   down. Would you do something for me? DON'T use the term SCAdians, OK?

H: Why?

M: Because this is a _Demo_ and that word detracts from the ambience and bugs
   the beejeesus out of me.

H: Then what do I use instead? (a bit beligerent here)

M: (Getting exasperated) Use "Gentle folk of the Society." It applies and
   will be recognized. If you must use another term in my hearing, use
   "SCA-bums and SCA-bunnies." You know, like skiing terms.

H: (Haughty) My Lord, I find that very obnoxious!

M: Me too, but I like it better than SCAdian. So I guess you had better use
   the "Gentle folk of the S.C.A." approach. (Said gently, with a great big
   [dangerous] smile) 'Cause if you say SCAdian in my hearing, I'll kill
   you.

But that the above conversation took place at all gives an idea how
offensive I find the term, otherwise I would only have posted to the net ;-).
AArrggg! I really do like the SCA-bum term though ;-) If I get to be King,
it would probably be one of my whims.

Enough of this. Sorry to vent, but the term was used and officially defined
in our local news letter. Grrrrr. I feel much better now.

Oops! 

One more book I meant to mention: Tirant lo Blanc, a medieval novel
written by Joanot Martorell and Marti Joan de Galba around 1430, and
translated from Catalan to English by David Rosenthal (Schocken Books,
1984).  This is one of those greatest-knight-who-ever-lived picaresque
novels, in which our hero, Tirant, travels around the world displaying
the finest in chivalric behavior.  The author was a Spanish knight, so
his work reflects the ideals of his class.  It ranges from fascinating
to amusing, and is an excellent look at the chivalric mind.

Actually, "Steward" is one of the very few medieval titles that we use
correctly in the SCA.  The king's Steward was essentially a regent.
Our Steward operates in much the same way.

I agree that "autocrat" is a lousy title for the person running an
event.  How about "Master of the Revels"?  That was what the person in
charge of setting up courtly festivities was called in a medieval
court.  "Feastocrat" is an abomination.  The person in charge of the
feast is the "Head Cook," or, if you like French, "Chef."  I suspect
that "Major Domo" derives from Italian (?) for Head of the Household,
so it would be a reasonable title, but I doubt anyone will want to use
it any more than they would want to use the good period "butler,"
because of their modern connotations.

Greetings, my lord David.

I do have a few references that you might find helpful.  The main one
is a modern work, "Chivalry," by Maurice Keen (Yale University Press
1984).  This book is excellently written, and makes delightful
reading.  It refers to many medieval works, but notes three in
particular:

Libre del ordre de cavayleria (Book of the Ordre of Chyvalry), Ramon
Lull (c 1270).

Ordene de chevalerie (Anonymous poem c 1250)

Boo of Chivalry, Geoffrey de Charnay, 1350.


Another good modern work is a recently published biography "William
Marshall: The Flower of Chivalry," by Georges Duby, translated by
Richard Howard (Pantheon Books, 1985).  This biography is based on a
poetic biography written shortly after Count William's death.  While
neither the original nor the modern work is intended as a primer on
chivalry, I personally consider William the Marshall to be the paragon
of everything chivalry ought to be, so a study of his life is a good a
lesson as any.

I also have a vague memory of a period work called "The Tree of
Battles", but I really don't remember anything about it.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Looking for name documentation
Message-Id: <Nov.11.12.42.08.1988.795@vanhalen.rutgers.edu>


Greetings gentles!

I am trying to find documentation for the use of the name "Olwen" as a
period given name.  There is a lady in the East who wants to register
the name with the College of Arms, but cannot because it cannot be
shown to be a human name in period.

The name appears in "The Mabinogion," in the story "Culwch and Olwen,"
where Olwen is the the daughter of Chief Giant Ysbaddaden.  The text
notes that the name means "white track," and that the giantess was
so named because white flowers sprang up in her path as she walked.
This character is clearly not human, and the Rules for Submissions
require that if a name is a divine or otherwise non-human name in
period, it must be shown also to be used by humans in period if it is
to be registered.

I have a vague memory that Tolkein named one of his character
"Olwen."  Can someone give me a reference?

If anyone has access to Bartrum's "Welsh Genealogies", can you look
for a period use of the name?

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

How could I forget a secondary weapon! Probably because I only use spears in
bridge and pass situations. I usually get wasted by another spear or
survive, so I don't usually get into situations that need them. In general
I prefer a six foot pole arm or 5'10" great sword. You stand in the front
line with either one, and you get a lot og room... from both teams. I guess
it is respect for the insane, or something.

Maces are probably the best for this, but if you have a chance to set up, a
sword is worth the suprise vaule. I saw this work well in a ship battle.
Robyyon (Sorry if I missed the speling Dennis ;-) used to use a dagger as a
second weapon. Folks would close to beat the pike range and get a nasty
suprise.

Secondary weapons can also be a problem in single combat. With a mace or
whatever as backup, _don't_ drop your weapon. This is true for any weapons
form really. Convention has a hold for an accidentally dropped weapon or one
that is pulled out of your hands _if_ _it_ _is_ _your_ _only_ _weapon_.
If you have a spare, no hold is called. I wouldn't want to fight single
dagger against most of the spearmen around here.

Anyway, thanks for the extra point, Coranna.

	Many thanks for the complement on An Tir war fighting.
A note on having a dangling weapon from the hand.
I have seen two ways to hang the weapon.
The first is to hang the weapon from the elbow area with a long enough lanyard
so that when the hand is dropped to hang next to the body the weapon is at the
right spot to grab without flailing about. The problem with this style is that
the lanyard is about 15 inches long and the weapon can flop about. The advantage
is that it leaves the wrist and fore arm free to move. 
The second is to have a very short lanyard attached to the wrist. This is better
for the quik grab. The hand is opened and a grab is made down and back to grasp
the weapon. This will bind up the wrist more but is much better to grab fast.

Subject: Marches
Message-Id: <8811101040.AA03394@davids.UUCP>

What I have been told is that "march" is, somewhat as you surmised,
a border territory.  Not necessarily between the east and middle
kingdoms, just a border territory.  For instance, my *shire* is
named Dragonsmark.  The older denizens tell me that "mark" there
is really a corruption of "march", which makes sense since we happen
to *be* the southern border of the middle.

I would guess that "march" refers to some amount of area which
a set of troops can effectively march around in for the protection
of the border/populace.  Possibly it was supposed to be 1/2 to 1
days march across?

Marches aren't common in other kingdoms?  Oh well...

On another note.  Colleges are as you described them, I know because
we researched what to do when we started forming our college group
last year.  But I also know of a Canton which acts as if it should
be called "college", (Hi AMQ!).  It's in Settmour Swamp at the
Rutgers Univ campus.

Subject: Short spears
Message-Id: <595195586/kee@A.NL.CS.CMU.EDU>

A few years back (I think it was the summer of Pennsic XV), the
fighters of the BMDL tried out the basic hoplite equipment combination.
Our Baron, Leonard the Younger, wanted to see how it would work so we
tried it for a couple of months at practices.  Against normal SCA
weaponry, it was a wash.  Against opponents also armed hoplite-style,
it was more interesting, however, and suggested a whole different way
of going about things.  However, without the use of face thrusts, it
couldn't do much more than suggest.  So we dropped it without regrets.

I concluded that there is a reason why so many hoplites in Greek art
are pictured holding their spears at head level in combat.  It's pretty
ineffective if you don't.

Subject: Re: Combat with two-handed Spears

Lord Bartholomew gives a very good introduction, especially the 'alone
in a melee' part!  [Warning: more stick talk ahead]

In answer to his question about multi-manned spears, I have never seen
this happen.  Those 12-foot spears are held by one person.  They have 
great advantages and equally great disadvantages.  Obviously the range
is an advantage.  My unit has two pikes 13 feet long, and it was a rare
thing to find rattan that long.  the disadvantages are in the sheer
weight of all that rattan, which is considerable.  They also wobble a 
great deal, as a small wobble has a lot of length down which to grow.  
[I am entering potentially volatile discussion areas now, please
remember that I am trying not to get into the "my kingdom does things 
the only right way" mode]

The West and East kingdoms differ greatly in their standards for pikes.
Currently both kingdoms seem to have found a good balance of standards.
In areas in which thrusting to the face is prohibited, I can see that 
having very long, sometimes very inaccurate pikes could lead to big
trouble.  Also, the fiberglass pikes are in common use out there, and 
as these are VERY accurate and VERY light, any extra length would not
also carry the innate disadvantages of long rattan.  These fiberglass
pikes also hit like a ton of bricks, and the fears that caused the
prohibition of face thrusts would be very well founded.  The fact that
these pikes can hit so accurately and so hard is the main reason that
I'm not jumping up and down to have them approved for use in the West.  
(I WILL buy one to use at next Pennsic, though!  When in Rome...)  I
would rather the West kept face thrusting legal and did not adopt the 
new pikes.  (I know there isn't a 1-1 correspondence there)  I was
fortunate enough to be able to use one, borrowed from a kind Trimarian,
in the field battle, and was quite impressed.  

Back to sort of the original discussion; it is very easy to break into
the range of the longer pikes, as it takes too long to choke up on the
length.  Without a buddy, the piker is easily pinned.  Running away is
always an option, however :-)  Again, Lord Bartholomew's description
was very good.  I really had to concentrate on targeting at Pennsic. 
Faces are indeed easy targets.
I try not to give away where I want to strike.  Fiberglass pikes can
move faster than shields, but not hving to block the face is an
advantage for the shieldman.  It balances out.  Rattan pikes often move
slower, but Western shieldmen better not leave their faces hanging out.

Well, Bartholomew, you think YOU rambled a long time...:-)

     The correct form of the title is "Chancellor of the Exchequer," which
is even longer. ;-)

     Does anyone know of a precedent for the use of any alternative to that
overused and totally disgusting term, "autocrat?"  I get sick and tired of
reading/hearing about "autocrats," though I must admit that "feastocrats"
are even worse.  Personally, I think the Steward of the Society ought to
have a different title, and the people who run events should be called
stewards.  Alternatively, perhaps the word "major-domo" would do okay.
Anyone else have any info/ideas on this topic?

Subject: Horse's Bransle variations -- last chance

Reminder notice:  I'm still collecting information on regional variations
of Horse's Bransle.  The original questions were:

> Without getting into a lengthy discussion of what is "right", I am curious
> if people would briefly respond with answers to the following specific
> questions:
>  1.  Do you do Horse's Bransle most often as a partner changing dance or

>      the right?

Based on responses so far, I want to clarify #3 a little (clear like mud?).
Rather than think of "travel to the left" as going somewhere, think in terms
of where your next partner comes from.  If your next partner comes from your
current partner's right, you are "travelling left".  If, on the other hand,
your next partner comes from your current partner's left, you are
"travelling right".  Note that the effect of travelling right can be
obtained by turning in place and going nowhere -- since we did a "Paw, paw
step to the right", if we turn in place we are in effect travelling right.

Apologies for the pedantry, but I've gotten enough responses to suggest that
I should make an attempt to better define that question.

If you haven't yet gotten your opinions in to me, feel free.  I'll aim to
tabulate responses at the beginning of next week (Crown Tourney here in
Atlantia this weekend - I'm gonna judge an A&S and watch lots of Dukes
try to become SuperDuke, so no NETting for me this weekend), and put out

The *word* Pandybat comes from THE Pandybat.  His name is Phil. He is a 
stuffed panda bear with bat wings sewn to his back, and he is the trophy
for the winner of the Annual Pandybat Competition.  The following is
copied from my previous posting of Sep.7, so all who followed this
discussion previously can ignore it and not miss anything.

An ancient and venerable tradition in the West (isn't everything in the
West ancient and venerable?) is the Pandybat Competition, held once a
year at Purgatorio Coronation or at October Crown.  The trophy is named 
Phil, and he is a stuffed panda bear with bat wings.  The winner must 
embroider their name(s) on the wings, or add some token to Phil's
accoutrements.  Phil already has a headband, a ponytail flail,
morris bells, numerous baldrics, and a pin or two.  The contest is
a melee, using new weapons that are "sure to devastate the field".
This means that the invented weapon is more dangerous to the bearer
than to any of the bearer's foes.  This gets VERY silly.  The object,
of course, is NOT to win the melee itself, but to demonstrate in action
the incredible futility of the 'weapon' you have invented.  Past
winners have been the 'turn pike', two spears lashed together to form a
cross, with thrusting tips at all four ends, borne by four people;
the aforementioned Ponytail Flail, a mace head on a two foot length of
rope attached to the head (he died saluting the Crown); the War Caber,
a ten-foot long duct-taped cardboard tube with a lanyard; and this
year's winner, the Battle Anvil. (Foam covered in duct tape, but he
played it very well)  We do this for the amusement of the Queen and the
populace, and to keep ourselves from taking this all too seriously.  

I hope this clears a bit of confusion,

Subject: two-handed Spears

This gets rather technical.  I am happy to discuss technique, etc.

The technique for fighting with spears and pikes will, of course, vary
depending on situation; war -vs- tourney for example.  I live in the
West Kingdom, and Crown tourneys are not generally fought with pikes or
pole weapons.  I understand that single-handed "spears" are common in
other Kingdoms.  But I digress.  

In warfare, I carry a pike (9 feet long at Pennsic, as long as the
rattan will allow in the West) and a mace attached to my arm armor with
a lanyard.  I work from behind a shield wall, so offense is more my
concern.  The best technique I've found so far, though not always
possible in a crammed bridge fight, is to take a wide stance that
rather resembles a fencer's.  With weight centered, slide one hand to
the back end of the pike (I always put a piece of duct tape there so I
can feel the end) and support the pike with the forward hand, business
end pointed at the target.  From this position, one can bring both arms
forward and slide the back hand up to extend the pike. From here (this
all takes place in one smooth motion, in theory) one can also extend the 
body in a sort of lunge to get that extra bit of reach without 
overbalancing.  All the power goes out of the thrust if you overextend.

If the bothersome enemy kills all your shieldmen, you are in a bad way,
but not totally helpless.  The range of the weapon is useful until the 
enemy breaks into your range.  at this point it is helpful to be 
holding your pike with your right hand forward, as it is easily brought
up from there to block an incoming blow (from a right-hander).  Your
secondary weapon comes in very useful at this point.  I like a mace
because I don't have to look at it; maces can't hit flat.  Viscount Sir 
Brandon D'Arindell is great at surprising enemy shieldmen this way, as 
a mace comes from out of nowhere into their helms when they thought him
pinned.  

I cannot tell which kingdom sas102@psuvm comes from, so I'll try to
give an overview of offense.  Kingdoms differ in that the East and 
Middle (forgive me if I've left another out, but let me know) prohibit
thrusting to the face.  This entirely changes the character of a 
shield wall.  At Pennsic I found myself working low a lot more than I
usually do.  This means that the pike goes under or between shields.  
I don't much like this (especially fighting against An Tir), because
when the other side decides to charge the shield wall, the pikeman can
end up trapped or in the way.  I mention AnTir because as a whole, they
seem to be able to time their charges to great advantage, not just run
in berserk to die.  When fighting in the West, or in any war in which
thrusting to the face is allowed, I like to keep the pike high over the
shields.  I can see better from here, and can do collective pike tricks
such as rocking shields and double-teaming.  The lunge position is
harder to keep here, though (well, it is for me, as I'm shorter than my
shieldmen).  

To use a pike in single combat, especially against someone with short
weapons, the bearer must be *very good*.  It's hard to strike while
backpedalling, and your opponent can run forward faster than you can
backpedal (guaranteed).  I love to use pikes in co-operative combat
situations (hey, I like that!), but I'll switch to sword and shield or
axe and shield for tourneys.  

That was some two cents, eh?  Any comments from out in netland?  I am 
especially interested in pike techniques when thrusting to the face is
not permitted.

From: Orilee_J_Ireland-Delfs.Henr@Xerox.COM
Message-ID: <881109-091420-1998@Xerox>

According to Lord Friedrich Tomasson, Steward's Deputy for the Regnum,
March and Riding are also used instead of Shire - in the Middle there is
one Riding, Hawkland Moor, which is the equivalent of a Shire, and there is
the March of Grimfells in Calontir.  The Middle Kingdom has 10 Marches that
are effectively Cantons (all in the Ohio/Kentucky area).

A College is not necessarily a Canton, it is a group that exists on a
college campus within the area covered by another group and normally goes
into a state of suspension during the summer months when school is not in
session.

Can anyone in the Middle (or elsewhere) give the etymology of March?  I
suspect it began as a reference to the border between the East and Middle
(eg Barony-March of the Debatable Lands).  But, why has it remained almost
exclusively a Mid-Realm designation?

On another note:  My Lord and I are planning a spring vacation in the
Seattle WA and Vancover BC area for the 15th through 22nd of April, 1989.
We would like to attend an event in the area on one of the weekends we are

so we can start making our travel arrangments (for example, what is the

In the East Kingdom (that includes State College, honest) I have only seen
two handed spears. The Spears used at Pensic Wars are nine feet long, made
of rattan or a special fiberglass, padded to a thrusting tip on one end, and
uncontrolable (mostly) one handed. You can occaisionaly get killed by a
spearman who has lost an arm, but that is too embarassing to go into ;-).

When I was a mere pup, I played around with a one handed spear and shield
combo. In a kingdom (the Middle) without face thrusting, this was a wash.
Is this what you thought we meant by spear? A friend used a similar weapon
for terror purposes in melees, dropping it and using a mace or ax (can you
say "more effective?" I knew you could!) once contact was made. I would be
interested to hear about other kingdoms, any hoppolites (hoopolites? {sp?})
out there?

Or are you thinking of multi-manned spears. With only nine feet there is
only room for one fighter. Another question: any one tried this in those
kingdoms with 12 foot spears?

Any way, to get back to the question as written, there are many ways to use
a two handed spear. Placement of the hands and possitioning of the weapon
(angle of attack) depend on tactical possition, target (no face or throat in
this kingdom... oh, and try to avoid the groin: "Do unto others...." ;-),
and personal style.

(Long Pause to Think -- This just got hard. Folks not interested in fighting
can skip this, if you haven't already.)

This is the point where things get into style and teaching a physical idea
in a print medium, both hard subjects. For a better understanding, find a
fighting practice or event and ask about it. Most of us will talk (preach?
;-) on our favourite style with little prompting. Quickly though, I use a
couple of different styles. Both assume a fencing stance that only presents
your side to your opponent (least target). In one, the forward hand is the
pivot, the rear moves for targeting, and both are used in the thrust like
a Hollywood bayonet thrust (avoid leaning into your opponent's thrust!)
The other uses the front hand to guide and target, the rear is for pivet,
and the strike is either the same as above or a modified body snap, pushing
the spear with the back hand and guiding with the front.

In terms of hand placement and angle of attack changing with the tactical
situation, this is what I usually see and use:
	Single combat		usually spear at waist level, tip slightly
				elevated, forward hand up, rear hand down,
				very slight crouch.

	Melee combat		spear at waist level, tip slightly
	(behind larger shield	elevated, forward hand up, rear hand down,
	 man or mass weapon)	deep crouch, close to teammate, going for
				leg, belly or shield pin.

	Melee combat		spear and hands at shoulder level, tip
	(behind smaller shield	depressed well below opponent's face,
	 man)			both hands palm out and up,
				standing straight up, close to teammate,
				going for leg, upper chest, or shield pin.

	Melee combat		spear nearly vertical in front of body,
	(not behind anyone)	tip just off the ground, butt in the air,
				both hands where ever they were when the 
				shit hit the fan, running backwards,
				blocking any blows, searching frantically
				for a teammate.

Well, thats the way it feels. ;-} Your mileage will vary. Please note that I
do not advocate feints to the face. Neither kingdom I fight in has face
thrusts, nor have I ever been in one that did, but I still find myself
accidently targeting a face - not a "good thing" and to be avoided where
ilegal.

Well, I've rambled too long, considering that I'm usually standing in the
shield wall with a great sword or glave scaring the opposing shields.

March, College, Riding, Canton, Shire, Barony, Province, City-State,
Dominion, Port.  Are there any other "official" group designations in
use out there?

In case anyone's interested (I know you & Friedrich know this one,
Orianna), the term "March" derives from Middle English marc, from Old
English maerc, "border," and thus has always meant "borderland."  In
period, its best-known usage is as a general term for the English
lands along the Welsh borders, the Welsh Marches, and their holders,
who were known as Marcher Lords.

As Lady Orianna notes, the most common usages in the SCA seems to be
along the East/Middle border.  There is one other example in the East,
the March of the Black Rose, which lies on our Atlantian border.

   I assume that you're asking about fighting one-on-one with standard SCA
spears; a 9 foot rattan (or now fiberglass) shaft with a thrusting point.
   I rather enjoy doing this on occasion - the technique is much like fencing
with a very _heavy_ foil.  Parrying is done by pushing the other shaft with
yours and basic evasive techniques (Duck! Dodge! Run!!).  Very aerobic.  I
might mention that this kind of practice does have benefits: I have numerous
times at the Pennsic Wars faced off against another spearman, and the practice
stood up.
   Pikes are another question entirely.  Here in the East we have 6-foot
polearms, my favorite weapon :->.  These are not really akin to the genuine
pikes such as the ones the Swiss used, which were ~14-16 foot as I recall.
Polearms are amenable to various cutting attacks with the 'lethal' 2-foot
blade, and thrusts with both the point and butt spike (butt spikes are not
in universal use).  In real pike fighting there are other techniques that we
don't use due to safety consideration, such as using the axe-shaped blade
to hook necks; front and back, breaking knees, pulling ankles, and the ever
favored 180 degree overhead chop, guaranteed to give any chivary knightmares.
   Pike/polearm blocking and defense is done by blocking with the shaft
(being careful in real life not to have your shaft cut), and of course
dodging, and running like hell.  Polearms actually have a much larger defensive
surface than a bastard, great, or katana sword - you have a 6 foot stick to
hide behind...
   Hope this answers some questions.

There are no doubt many sources; my favorite is Saviolo's manual on rapier-
fight (contained in "Three Elizabethan Fencing Manuals" from Academic Press
(I think - see any university library)).  There is a chapter on the "Nobility
of Women" describing women who bested men in combat and a woman who led
a condotta in Tripoli).  Saviolo describes one event that may be real in
which he and a friend were being bested by numerous assailants but were
saved by his mother, who emerged from the family house, halberd in hand (the
shotgun of the 1550's?) and drove the assailants off, leaving several dead.

The chapter is clearly aimed at Elizabeth of England; the topic of the
"Nobility of Women" was much less popular in the 17th century.

Greetings!

I should like to somewhat clarify some of my previous remarks:  those points
made by William de Corbie are absolutely correct, and very much to be noted by
all.

The reasons I tried to point out how total the Board's authority is, were:  1)
as I have said several times already, not enough people realize that the SCA
is a non-member corporation, and the ramifications (both positive and
negative) thereof; 2) so it _would_ be realized.  It just seems to me that
this is a fundamental fact, and as such should be included in an individual's
opinion-forming process.

Also, as regards the description of the Drachenwald Curia:  from what I've
been reading, the structure might not be so unique after all (which I like the
thought of, personally).  I know it's not too terribly unlike the structure we
hoped to have here in Trimaris, although it didn't work out that way in the
end.

Thank you.

Message-Id: <8517@spl1.UUCP>

Greetings!

Having read William de Corbie's most recent remarks, I feel constrained to
point out that, should the Board choose, they _can_ with complete impunity run
the Society as a dictatorship, however unwise doing so would be.

However, as has been pointed out repeatedly, the Board _does_ read its mail.
The Board _has_, of recent times, shown signs of changing its viewpoints and
modifying the operations of the Society.  There are certainly more frequent
calls for member input than there used to be:  there used to be none!
And as Sir William points out, we need to tell the Board what we think,
otherwise they aren't going to know!  As the SCA, Inc. is a non-member
corporation, the only means open to the Populace-at-Large is the weight of
public opinion, as evidenced by mail.

We, the Society, need to continue and expand upon such forms of communication
amongst ourselves as this network.  Furthermore, if any or all of us is to
comment effectively, we _must_ find a way to know more about what's going on
at the "uppermost levels".  But if any of it is to count for anything, we must
communicate with the Board as well.

Thank you.

                                     Yours in Service,

Subject: EK Coronation story


	The East Kingdom Coronation Tourney was the second rattan tournament
ever fought in, the first being the local event this summer where I qualified
in sword and shield.  It was an accumulation tourney.  The winner of the 
one man bout was the captain of the two man team, the captain of the winning
two man team was the captain of the four man team, etc.  I was standing near
the List table when the MoL called my name.
	"Yes?", I answered.
	"I'm sorry, Dagonell." she said in a quiet voice.
	Brief puzzlement followed by dawning horror set in.  In an even
quieter voice, I asked her, "Who am I fighting in the first round?"
	"John the Pell." ( a Master at Arms )

	I was later informed someone had timed the battle.  I lasted exactly
eleven seconds.  After the second round pairings had been made, I asked him
who we fought next.  
	"Manfred von Halstern's team." John answered.  
	"Two members of the chivalry?"
	"Yup."
	"Is there anyone in this tourney besides me who uses black to hold
up his pants?"

	My instructions for the second bout were rather complex.  "Stay
alive as long as possible." John told me.  I'm proud to say I lasted much
longer than I did against John, nearly fifteen seconds.  John was left on his
own against a sword and shield and a kneeling spearman.  He ran to the side
to line up the spearman behind the shield and then attacked.  That's when
it happened.

	John's sword went spinning through the air high over head.  A scream
issued from John's throat, "NNNOOOOOO!!!!!" (East Kingdom Marshalls do NOT
call a hold for a lost weapon in a melee.)  John went shield-to-shield
against Manfred, pushing his opponent away and himself toward the fallen
weapon.  He somersaulted over the spearman crawling towards it, grabbed the
weapon in mid-roll and came up on his knees with the sword over head just in
time to block the helmet shot thrown by Manfred.  The entire crowd watching
cheered wildly.  Everyone agreed it was the best manuver seen on the field
that day.

Once did I read of a learned book,

Perhaps this tome exists still,
I'd like a copy, where may I
find it? If you will?

Ergh. Obviously writing TCP code and poetry cause horrible
mental gear clashing (grrrrank!-claaaaaank!)

So, does anyone know of the "definative" work for a code
of honor? I read once of a medevial work that was considered
the ultimate source, but of course can't remember the name,
the author, the source, and would probably be hard 
pressed to tell the date as well.

Any help would be appreciated.

Subject: Horse's Bransle and regional variants

Having recently moved from the Middle Kingdom to Atlantia, and having
traveled quite a bit in the Middle in the last 8 years or so, I've noticed
many regional variations in dance ( as well as many other things, but that's
a different topic ).  My current question is
           "How do you do Horse's Bransle?"
More specifically, in the section where miming the horse, which I first
learned as "paw, paw, step to the right, turn over your left shoulder",
in which direction do you travel when turning?  Arbeau (tr. Evans) says
only "turn to the left", and also says "the dancers join both hands again
and repeat from the beginning."  I have most often seen and done this
dance as a partner changing dance, which means that on the "turn to the
left" portion, one must travel one direction or the other.  I have seen
it done both traveling to the left and to the right, while always being
a turn over the left shoulder, i.e. the turn is immaterial to the direction
of travel.

Without getting into a lengthy discussion of what is "right", I am curious
if people would briefly respond with answers to the following specific
questions:
  1.  Do you do Horse's Bransle most often as a partner changing dance or
      remaining with the same partner throughout the dance?
  2.  Do you do Horse's Bransle most often in a (double) circle (lords
      outside facing in, ladies facing out), or in a line of facing couples?
  3.  When you do Horse's Bransle as a partner changing dance, do you
      normally travel to the left (change partners so that the person
      on your current partner's right will be your next partner), or to
      the right?

Please respond directly to me, at the address below, so as to not tie up
the Net.  After several days of tabulating responses, maybe a whole week,
I'll report back with totals for anyone interested.

     Thanks for helping scratch my curiosity itch.

A disturbing thought arises: One of the names under consideration for
the soon-to-form principality in the western part of the East is
"Principality of the Lakes".  Applying the West Kingdom's term for the

Baileywick, like Riding, College, and March (I think), is an
alternative term for a Canton.  I agree with you, my lady, it's a cool
name.

The title Sheriff is currently restricted.  It is deemed to be a
landed title, which would be used by the rulling noble of a Shire.
Since shires don't have ruling nobles, it cannot be used as a title.

In some Kingdoms, there is an office of Sheriff.  In particular, I
believe there is a High Sheriff of Atenveldt, though I'm not sure was
the office is for.

In ancient history, in the East, before the title was restricted,
there were landed Sheriffs for some Shires.  Earl Aelfwine was one,
but that shire has folded.  The last person in the East (and perhaps
in the Known Wolrd) with the right to the title is Yosef Alaric,
Sheriff of the Smoking Rocks.

In some Principalities, the heirs to the coronet are called "Tanist
and Tanista".  Tanist was the title of the heir to the throne of
Ireland.  The term is not universally used in the SCA.

I tend to agree, in that the Bailiwick (or Baileywick) of Ivyeinrust is more
unusual than the regular Canton, Shire or College. The group itself is of
canton status within the Barony of Bhakail in the East. It primarily is
composed of the University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University, although
it actually includes all of Philadelphia (by zip code, of course), encompassed
by these grand institutions :-). Another interesting note is that Ivyeinrust
in an anagram for University.

Greetings gentles!

This past Saturday, East Kingdom Crown Tourney was fought in
Brewerskeep, just north of Concordia (Albany).  The victor and heir
to the Eastern Crown was Duke Morgan Sheridan, who fought for Lady
Maurya Etain Sableswan.  

The other finalist, and therefore now Admiral of the Armies, was Duke
Ronald Wilmot.  He was defeated in four bouts of a best of 5 final.

The tourney as a whole was well-fought, courteous, and chivalrous.
Although the day was cold, everyone seemed to have a good time, and
even that problem disappeared once we went in for the wonderful.

  Good Greetings Gentles!
       I am a resident of the Grand Kingdom of the Outlands and have been
 for 9 years now, and had been arround during the time when the Outlands
 was a Principality of Atenveldt. At that time the Heirs to the Outlands 
 Thrones were styled 'Tanist' and 'Tanista' and were called 'Your Excellencies'
      These titles are pronounced TAH-nist and tah-NEE-sta, and(I believe)
 stem from the Scottish clans wherein the Tanist was the next in line to 
 succeed the clan Patriarch. The term Tanista was coined in response to the
 need for a title for the Tanist's consort. I don't have any knowledge as to

This is a short addition to the talk about Heirs to the Coronet being 
called Tanist and Tanista. The term Tanist and the subsequent term
tanistry are of I believe Scandanivian origin and refer to the practice
of chieftainship passing not to the first born but rather to the most 
capable of ruling. This was decided at various times in history by either 
acclaimation of the clan or by the last wishes of the outgoing chieftain. 
A logical result of this system was that rather than an older man (40 years) 
taking charge who may have already passed his life expectancy, a younger
son or relative was usually made king. In any event the new kings generally 
happened to be around 20 years of age and in the prime of their lives.
This practice was carried to the Scots some years later with the coming 
of the Vikings to the Shetland islands and other northern areas of the 
Scotish homelands. 

It never fails to amaze me how civilized those Vikings were. :^)

    ...Does anyone know if there is or was an official SCA title of Sheriff
    (or Shire Reeves).  Someone said that there was such a thing many moons
    ago when the Known World was still young...
			    Dylan ap Maelgwn
ah yes, Sheriffs. Indeed, milord Dylan, there used to be sheriffs, and
there is still at least one: 
    Baron Yosef Alaric of the Baliset ("Hi, I'm Yosef, trust me"),
Companion of the Pelican, Companion of the Troubadors (Eastern award for
bardic arts), Companion of the Burdened Tyger (Eastern award for harried
but successful autocrats), Companion of the Dwarven Hammer and of Tempered
Steel (both Baronial orders from Hammerhold, Meridies), Companion of the
Freedom of the Bridge (Baronial award for non-residents, Bridge, East), and
my boss (Commander of the Legion of the Black Fist -- we're the honest
mercenaries; we stay bought) is also Sheriff of Smoking Rocks (southeast
Massachusetts).
    what i recall of his various stories concerning this situation is this:
long ago when the world was young and all, the BOD decided to allow the
royalty of the various kingdoms to, at their pleasure, designate ceremonial
sheriffs for shires. i think the sheriffs were supposed to be named only
for shires that had done something especially good, or when the sheriff
himself had done lots of work developing the group, but it was just too
small for (or didn't want) barony status -- something like that. thus
sheriffs were for that period permitted but not required.
    sometime later, the BOD changed its mind, and forbade the naming of any
further sheriffs. however, it did grandfather in all the sheriffs stil
extant, with the proviso that when any sheriff's post became vacant (e.g.
the title-holder moved away) it would be flushed.  when last we discussed
this matter, Yosef thought he was the only ceremonial sheriff still in his
position. About all he does as sheriff (besides tell stories about it) is
to hold court at Smoking Rocks events -- which courts tend to consist of
awards for tourneys and other contests held at the events, and random
foolery.

    P.S.  As long as we're talking about titles, what is the title of the
    heir of the coronet?
i think this varies from principality to principality. i believe i've seen
the heirs to the Coronet of Drachenwald called at various times the Tanist
& Tanista and the Heir & Heiress.

             Life in the Current Middle Ages

SCA is the Society for Creative Anachronism, which is a group
dedicated to recreating the Middle Ages in the present. Many
groups meet weekly, and at these meetings we dance, talk, study,
learn, revel, and make plans. But first, let's get a little bit
of info about the SCA in general.
 
              Where did the SCA come from?
              ___________________________
 
 The avowed purpose of the SCA is the study and recreation of the
 European Middle Ages, its crafts, sciences, arts, traditions,
 literature, etc. The SCA "period" is defined to be 600 AD to 1600 AD,
 concentrating on the Western European High Middle Ages. Under
 the aegis of the SCA we study dance, calligraphy, martial arts,
 cooking, metalwork, stained glass, costuming, literature....
 well, if they did it, somebody in the SCA does it (Except die of
 the Plague!).
 
 As you can probably guess, the thing that separates the SCA from
 a Humanities 101 class is the *active* participation in the
 learning process. To learn costuming, you design and build
 costumes. To learn SCA infantry fighting, you make armor,
 weapons, shields, etc., and put them on and go learn how it
 feels to wear them when somebody is swinging a (rattan) sword at
 you. To learn brewing, you make (and sample!) your own wines,
 meads and beers.
 
 You will frequently hear a SCA person describe the SCA as
 recreating the Middle Ages "as they ought to have been." In some
 ways this is true -- we have few plagues, indoor plumbing, few
 peasants. In the dead of winter we have other things to eat than
 King's venison, salt pork and dried tubers.
 
 The SCA was invented (? discovered? begun?) in 1966 in Berkeley,
 California by a group of Science Fiction and Fantasy fans who
 wanted a "theme" party. Following the party, a group got
 together to discuss the idea of a medieval re-creation and
 re-enactment group. (which has ended up being much like the
 Civil War, Revolutionary War or Buckskinning re-enactment groups
 that were beginning to form in the US.) In Britain Medieval and
 British Civil War recreation societies had existed for any
 number of years. The Californians incorporated as a non-profit
 educational society, started forming groups, and away they went.
 
 Since 1966, the society has grown to include nearly 13,000
 paying members in the US, Canada, Mexico, Great Britain, Sweden,
 Germany, Italy, France, Korea, Okinawa, New Zealand, Australia
 and Greenland. Current demographic estimates indicate that for
 every dues-paying member there are 4 non-subscribing members
 active in local groups.
 
               How is the SCA Organized?
               ________________________
 
 The SCA is a feudal society. No democracies for us! The SCA
 "Knowne World" is divided into twelve Kingdoms, each with a King
 and Queen (who rule by right of arms), a Prince and Princess
 (heirs to the throne), and a council or Curia of Great Officers
 who handle the mundane, day to day details of running the
 kingdom.
 
 A feudal society takes its form from the idea of honor and duty.
 A noble owes duty of service to his lord, who might be a Baron or
 Knight.  His lord owes in return the duty of protection from danger and 
 food, money, etc. when times are bad.
 
 On the next level up, the higher nobles owe fealty (the word that
 encompasses this idea of reciprocal responsibilities) to the
 King. In return for their service as good stewards of the land
 and readily available warriors, the King owes Knights, Barons, and 
 other high nobles protection, honor, and a return of money, food, etc in 
 times of hardship. It is something like the idea of a Pyramid
 club, but the benefits are greater and the idea of personal
 honor and mutual responsibility, not profit, tie the structure
 together (or at least it did in Europe for nearly a thousand
 years).
 
 In the SCA this structure underlies our Society, although not
 nearly as rigidly as in the medieval days. Our King, the head of
 our Kingdom and our liege lord, has fought for the right to bear
 the crown by fighting in a Crown Tourney for the right to make
 his Lady Queen. <In the case of female fighters, she has fought
 for the right to make her Lord King.> In some Kingdoms, like the West
 (middle California), the King's word is law, and the people willingly
 obey his every whim. Of course, four to six months later there is a new
 King, with different ideas. Life can get interesting.
 
 Fighting in the SCA, or Why are those people hitting each other?
 _______________________________________________________________
 
 Fighting in the SCA evolved from what happened when two armed
 knights were unhorsed and had to fight on the ground. It
 resembles nothing so much as medieval infantry fighting. There
 are two basic types of SCA fights: single combat, and group or
 team battles, known as melees. SCA fighting does have rules. The
 first, and most important rule, is that each and every fighter
 on the field has honor. The fighter keeps faith with his honor
 by accepting blows that would be killing or wounding (more about
 this a little later).
 
 The second is like unto it; A fighter keeps faith with his
 brother fighters by acknowledging his opponent's word -- if he
 says it was light, it was light. Since we prefer that no one get
 hurt, SCA fighting is done with real armor (made with leather,
 metal, padding, kydex, etc) and rattan swords. Rattan is that
 bamboo-y stuff, only with a solid core, that furniture is made
 of. Rattan, surprisingly enough, is springy enough to absorb
 some of the force of the blow (although blows are *real solid*)
 and light enough to approximate a real steel sword. Swords are
 made by wrapping rattan staffs with strapping tape, covering
 them with duct tape (known as silver tape) for esthetic reasons,
 and attaching some sort of hilt or handle. Armor is much more
 complex -- some armor, being made of steel, rivets, leather,
 etc, can take more than 40 hours per piece of armor (for
 example, a armored "glove" with moving fingers and joints can
 take upwards of 75 hours to complete).
 
 There are several essential and required pieces of armor --
 helm, neck and cervical vertebrae protection, elbows and knees,
 kidneys, hands, groin. After that, most SCA fighters wear chest,
 leg, arm and forearm, and feet protection.
 
 If a blow hits hard enough that a sword would have cloven mail,
 it is "good". Beginning fighters, as they are being trained, are
 taught blow calibrations. Fighters are trained, by the way.
 Aspiring fighters attend some months of fighter practices where
 they learn the rules and learn how to protect themselves on the
 field. After some time, they attempt to "authorize" -- they go
 before a panel of experienced fighters, fight a couple of
 rounds, and if the panel decides the fighter is safe (not good,
 you understand, but unlikely to hurt him or herself or an
 opponent) they are authorized to fight in Tourneys. This process
 (from starting to fight to being authorized) can take from a
 couple of months to a year or more.
 
 Fighting brings us to *the Chivalry.* The Chivalry is a group of
 elite fighters -- those who have gotten very very good at
 fighting, and who at the same time have absorbed the concepts of
 Honor and Chivalry (they're basically good guys), have learned
 something of basic Heraldry, Chess, something about the Arts and
 Sciences, can behave well in public, and are generally good
 examples for people everywhere.
 
 (The word Chivalry comes from the Old French *chevalerie*
 <related to the Spanish *caballeria*>, meaning horse-fighter,
 cavalry, "knight". It came to French and Spanish from Latin
 caballerius, horse rider. As only the wealthy could afford the
 horse and trappings of a mounted warrior, it became the province
 of the nobles to be mounted and fighters. Thus the elite status.
 The word has come down to us from a different route as
 *cavalry*. Oh, well!) <There are rank-equivalents to Knights in
 the Arts and Sciences, called "Laurels", and in the Services,
 called "Pelicans". I will discuss them later on!>
 
 A King (if he is himself a Knight, and not all Kings are) can
 knight a fighter if he (or she) thinks the candidate is
 deserving. Usually the other Chivalry have agreed, or it doesn't
 happen. (If the King isn't a Knight, another member of the
 Chivalry can hold the sword with the King. Only a Knight can
 make a Knight.) The Knights swear personal fealty to the Crown.
 Since some people, for religious reasons, reasons of personal
 honor, etc, feel that swearing fealty is inappropriate for them,
 a branch of Chivalry has been created, called Masters, who do
 not have to swear fealty. Upon receiving the accolade of
 Knighthood, the candidate receives a Gold chain to wear about
 the neck, a white belt, and gold spurs. Some receive a *real*
 sword, as well.
 
       Why Do you all have such funny names?
       _____________________________________
 
 Every person in the SCA picks a name to use in the Society. It
 could be something simple (George of Wardcliff) or something
 elaborate (Dughall Aislean nic mac Lathurna). Most people pick a
 time period in the SCA "period" (between 600 and 1600) and a
 country (any place that can documentably be proven to have had
 trade with western Europe during the period), and choose a name
 from that. Some people just pick a name and forget about it;
 some have elaborate persona stories to go with their names.
 
 Even our towns have new names. Lansing, MI, is Northwoods,
 Toronto is Septentria, Boston is Carolingia, the San Francisco
 bay area is the Principality of the Mists, etc.
 
 Most folk in the SCA register their names and a heraldic device
 that they design to represent them. Also, later in their SCA
 careers, they may be given awards and rank, at which time their
 devices become "Arms" and they are most properly called "Lord"
 or "Lady So-and-So."
 
 Rank in the SCA, or How Come She is Wearing a Crown?
 ____________________________________________________
 
 There are two sorts of peers in the SCA; Royal Peers and Peers.
 Royal Peers are folk who have worn the crown of a Kingdom or
 Principality at least once. Ex-Princes are Viscounts,
 Ex-Princesses Viscountesses, and from there it gets complex.
 Those who have been King or Queen once are Counts/Countesses.
 Those who have been King or Queen twice are Dukes/Duchesses.
 Those who have been King or Queen more than that are generally
 considered masochistic! (Small in-joke!) Seriously, there are
 many who have reigned at least three times, and in the West
 there is a legendary Duke who has been King eight times.
 
 Other sorts of Peers are folk who, through dint of talent, hard
 work, and long effort, are recognized for their contributions
 and skills. We have already talked about the Knights. There are
 also the Companions of the Laurel (Talented craftsmen and artists,
 recognized for having talents and being willing to teach and be
 gracious), and the Companions of the Pelican (generally skilled
 bureaucrats -- somebody *has* to do the hard paperwork of running a
 Kingdom with 3000 people in it, and some people keep working at this
 sort of task for years.). The Pelican was thought in medieval times to
 be the most self-sacrificing animal -- it was thought a Pelican would 
 pierce her beast to allow her heart's blood to drip into the
 mouths of her offspring when food was short. Peers are made by
 the desire of the King and Queen in accordance with the
 recommendations of the rest of the order.
 
          Feasting, Dancing and Merrymaking
          ________________________________
 
 One of the most interesting parts of the SCA is the Events --
 the times when we put on our costumes, go out and dance those
 dances we've been practicing, flirt, eat, talk, and generally
 party. Events are held almost every weekend of the year
 somewhere in the country. Most groups hold at least one event
 per year; some larger groups will hold two or more.
 
 At events there are often tourneys, art exhibits or
 competitions, dance classes, workshops, and, later in the
 evening, Royal or Baronial Court, and dancing. Many times there
 will be a Feast in the evening. Other times, for smaller events
 or if a newer group is holding the event, there will be a
 dessert revel (People go out for dinner and then come back for a
 dessert buffet).
 
 The events are the most fun to most folk, because you get to go
 and show off all the things you have been learning in the past
 few months.
 
          What Kind of Person Joins the SCA?
          __________________________________
 
 SCA folk tend to be people like you and me -- just plain folks,
 but people who enjoy doing something more with their weekends. A
 high percentage of SCA members are involved in high tech fields
 -- Computers, Aerospace, high energy physics, etc. This has been
 attributed to the fact that people who play all week with highly
 complex, modern technology find it highly relaxing to spend
 their leisure time working with a different kind of technology,
 in a less modern setting. There are lots of people in all fields
 in the SCA -- historians, writers, secretaries, law enforcement
 personnel, teachers, programmers, insurance agents -- the appeal
 of the SCA is widespread.
 
 A housemate of a SCA person recently said: "From what I can tell
 about these wild and crazy SCA people, they do more than just
 this fighting thing. They really like to make and wear the
 medieval clothes (garb), eat the medieval food, dance the
 medieval dances to the medieval music, maybe even make their own
 medieval music, and other medieval party type activities. They
 also seem to like to be medieval so they can relax and have a
 good time. They are quite willing to talk about SCA or invite
 you to the SCA stuff or whatever."
 
               How You Can Get Involved
               _______________________
 
 We welcome you to our local meetings and our events. You needn't
 join the SCA, Inc, to attend and participate (although if you
 decide to be with us regularly you may wish to join). The only
 requirement to come to an event is that you make some attempt at
 pre-1600 costume -- and most groups have "loaner" costumes for
 people who want to come to their first event.
 
 If you want more information about groups near you, you can call
 our corporate office in Milpitas, CA, at (408) 262-5250, or send
 a notice to this mailing list or newsgroup, or contact the
 Society Chronicler (Pat McGregor) at (517) 351-4962 (email:

Greetings to All!

Hope everyone had a neat-o spiffy-keen Hallowe'en!

When Trimaris was a Principality, the Heirs to the Throne were known as the
Tanist and Tanista.  They were addressed as "His/Her/Your/Their Excellencies",
but were not considered to have a Presence.

As to "Sheriffs" and "Reeves":  in earlier days, many groups referred to their
local Exchequer as their Reeve, since "reeve" has fewer letters and syllables
and so is easier to spell and stuff like that.

Nowadays, we have a Kingdom Sheriff.  This is the "Official Lost-and-Found
Person":  Lost-and-Found items go to the Sheriff, and people then know who to
contact.  Many groups now have a local Sheriff as well, for much in the same
reason.  In the past, items in the Kingdom Lost-and-Found which have gone
unclaimed for a very long time have been auctioned off to raise funds for the
Kingdom (after a last chance to ransom them has been afforded just prior to
the auction).

Also, to any and all those gentles who have been asking about various books:
I understand that Lord Knikolos Major of Salem-by-the-Sea, of the Barony of
the South Downs (Atlanta, GA) in the Kingdom of Meridies, is running a
private mail-order book business tailored to the SCA and specializing in books
from abroad.  I do not have any information other than that, or his mundane
address, so I suggest interested gentles contact the Meridies Kingdom
Seneschal or go through the South Downs Seneschal.  (The newsletter of
Meridies is _Popular Chivalry_, if people want to look up addresses.)

Subject: Sources on Medieval Women

Greetings gentles,

My name is Tatyana and I am from Felding (Wellesley College) in Carolingia.

I have found 3 books that have been very useful in both a general understanding
of women's lives in the Middle Ages and Renaissance as well as a resource for 
finding primary sources. They are:

1. Mary Beth Rose, ed. _Women in the Middle Ages and in the Renaissance: 
Literary and Historical Perspectives_. Syracuse University Press. 1986.

This is a book comprised of short essays written by various scholars on such 
things as queenship and spirituality. 

2. Frances and Joseph Gies. _Women in the Middle Ages_. Barnes and Noble. 
1978.

In addition to background, this books offers a portrait of several famous 
medieval women, such as Hildegarde of Bingen, Blanche of Castile, and Eleanor 
de Montfort as well as sketches of less well-known (and well-born) women.

3. Margaret Wade LaBarge. _A Small Sound of the Trumpet: Women in Medieval 
Life_. Boston:Beacon Press. 1986.

I think that this book is the best of the group. It offers a picture of the 
lives of medieval women of different social classes and different "professions"
ranging from queens to beguines to healers.  The list of "further reading" is 
quite impressive.

These books tend to be in the "Women's Studies" section of bookstores. I 
welcome additions to this list, particularly sources on medieval townswomen.

Subject: Pandybats

In Digest 152, ELMAR SCHMEISSER asks about the etymology of the term
"pandybat".  My dictionary (the reasonably good _Webster's Deluxe Unabridged
Dictionary_, second edition, 1983) doesn't contain the word pandybat,
but does have:

       pan'dy, n.; pl.pan'dies,[L./pande/, open (your hand), imperative of
               /pandere/, to extend, open.] a stroke or blow on the hand,
               as with a cane, for punishment. [Scot.]
and:

       pan'dy, v.t; pandied. pt., pp.;pandying, ppr. to punish by striking
               the hand, as with a cane. [Scot.]

so, I would conjecture that a pandybat is the cane used to strike the hand
for punishment, as above.  Now, how this becomes a tool to inflict harm
upon oneself, uh, well, er, dunno...   Anyone got a better dictionary?
(is there an OED in the house??  :-)

In medieval England, let's say from Anglo-Saxon times to the Angevin
period, the Sheriff was the king's representative in a shire.  It was
not a hereditary title, but an appointed office, at least not as things
were supposed to run.  
In 1170, Henry II ordered an inquest, replacing most of the
sheriffs with more loyal and dependable sorts, since the office had
deteriorated somewhat.  The local Earl would often either hold the
office, or appoint someone to his liking (redirecting funds, I 
daresay).

        Perusing my lady's bookshelves this morning (she's a librarian) I
came across a book that you might find useful in your quest for info about
women in the middle ages and renaissance.  Not only is it full of essays about
women rangeing through the entire period, it is also full of references to
other sources and authors.  The book is entitled "Women in the Middle Ages
and Renaissance", it is (edited) by Mary Beth Rose, and it's LOC entry is

  Good Greetings Gentles!
       I am a resident of the Grand Kingdom of the Outlands and have been
 for 9 years now, and had been arround during the time when the Outlands
 was a Principality of Atenveldt. At that time the Heirs to the Outlands 
 Thrones were styled 'Tanist' and 'Tanista' and were called 'Your Excellencies'
      These titles are pronounced TAH-nist and tah-NEE-sta, and(I believe)
 stem from the Scottish clans wherein the Tanist was the next in line to 
 succeed the clan Patriarch. The term Tanista was coined in response to the
 need for a title for the Tanist's consort. I don't have any knowledge as to 
 the titles in other Principalities, but am anxious to here from others. I 
 hope I have been of some service in this quest for information.
                       In service to the Dream,
                            I remain,

Message-Id: <26575@tut.cis.ohio-state.edu>

This is a short addition to the talk about Heirs to the Coronet being 
called Tanist and Tanista. The term Tanist and the subsequent term
tanistry are of I believe Scandanivian origin and refer to the practice
of chieftainship passing not to the first born but rather to the most 
capable of ruling. This was decided at various times in history by either 
acclaimation of the clan or by the last wishes of the outgoing chieftain. 
A logical result of this system was that rather than an older man (40 years) 
taking charge who may have already passed his life expectancy, a younger
son or relative was usually made king. In any event the new kings generally 
happened to be around 20 years of age and in the prime of their lives.
This practice was carried to the Scots some years later with the coming 
of the Vikings to the Shetland islands and other northern areas of the 
Scotish homelands. 

It never fails to amaze me how civilized those Vikings were. :^)

Greetings to All!

Hope everyone had a neat-o spiffy-keen Hallowe'en!

When Trimaris was a Principality, the Heirs to the Throne were known as the
Tanist and Tanista.  They were addressed as "His/Her/Your/Their Excellencies",
but were not considered to have a Presence.

As to "Sheriffs" and "Reeves":  in earlier days, many groups referred to their
local Exchequer as their Reeve, since "reeve" has fewer letters and syllables
and so is easier to spell and stuff like that.

Nowadays, we have a Kingdom Sheriff.  This is the "Official Lost-and-Found
Person":  Lost-and-Found items go to the Sheriff, and people then know who to
contact.  Many groups now have a local Sheriff as well, for much in the same
reason.  In the past, items in the Kingdom Lost-and-Found which have gone
unclaimed for a very long time have been auctioned off to raise funds for the
Kingdom (after a last chance to ransom them has been afforded just prior to
the auction).

Also, to any and all those gentles who have been asking about various books:
I understand that Lord Knikolos Major of Salem-by-the-Sea, of the Barony of
the South Downs (Atlanta, GA) in the Kingdom of Meridies, is running a
private mail-order book business tailored to the SCA and specializing in books
from abroad.  I do not have any information other than that, or his mundane
address, so I suggest interested gentles contact the Meridies Kingdom
Seneschal or go through the South Downs Seneschal.  (The newsletter of
Meridies is _Popular Chivalry_, if people want to look up addresses.)

The title Sheriff is currently restricted.  It is deemed to be a
landed title, which would be used by the rulling noble of a Shire.
Since shires don't have ruling nobles, it cannot be used as a title.

In some Kingdoms, there is an office of Sheriff.  In particular, I
believe there is a High Sheriff of Atenveldt, though I'm not sure was
the office is for.

In ancient history, in the East, before the title was restricted,
there were landed Sheriffs for some Shires.  Earl Aelfwine was one,
but that shire has folded.  The last person in the East (and perhaps
in the Known Wolrd) with the right to the title is Yosef Alaric,
Sheriff of the Smoking Rocks.

In some Principalities, the heirs to the coronet are called "Tanist
and Tanista".  Tanist was the title of the heir to the throne of
Ireland.  The term is not universally used in the SCA.

In the West, the heirs to the thrones of the four principalities are 
called the Lord and Lady of <Principality>.  They are addressed as
'Your Excellency'.  

I've been around about five years, but I don't recall hearing about
Shire Reeves, or Sheriffs.  But then, I'd never heard of a 
Baileywick either.  Is this similar to a riding or a canton, or is it a
name for a region not officially incorporated by itself?  The
Baileywick of Ivyeinrust is a really cool name, and I'm curious as to 
what it encompasses.

A disturbing thought arises: One of the names under consideration for
the soon-to-form principality in the western part of the East is
"Principality of the Lakes".  Applying the West Kingdom's term for the
heiress...

Baileywick, like Riding, College, and March (I think), is an
alternative term for a Canton.  I agree with you, my lady, it's a cool
name.

I tend to agree, in that the Bailiwick (or Baileywick) of Ivyeinrust is more
unusual than the regular Canton, Shire or College. The group itself is of
canton status within the Barony of Bhakail in the East. It primarily is
composed of the University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University, although
it actually includes all of Philadelphia (by zip code, of course), encompassed
by these grand institutions :-). Another interesting note is that Ivyeinrust
in an anagram for University.

    ...Does anyone know if there is or was an official SCA title of Sheriff

			    Dylan ap Maelgwn
ah yes, Sheriffs. Indeed, milord Dylan, there used to be sheriffs, and
there is still at least one: 
    Baron Yosef Alaric of the Baliset ("Hi, I'm Yosef, trust me"),
Companion of the Pelican, Companion of the Troubadors (Eastern award for
bardic arts), Companion of the Burdened Tyger (Eastern award for harried
but successful autocrats), Companion of the Dwarven Hammer and of Tempered
Steel (both Baronial orders from Hammerhold, Meridies), Companion of the
Freedom of the Bridge (Baronial award for non-residents, Bridge, East), and
my boss (Commander of the Legion of the Black Fist -- we're the honest
mercenaries; we stay bought) is also Sheriff of Smoking Rocks (southeast
Massachusetts).
    what i recall of his various stories concerning this situation is this:
long ago when the world was young and all, the BOD decided to allow the
royalty of the various kingdoms to, at their pleasure, designate ceremonial
sheriffs for shires. i think the sheriffs were supposed to be named only
for shires that had done something especially good, or when the sheriff
himself had done lots of work developing the group, but it was just too
small for (or didn't want) barony status -- something like that. thus
sheriffs were for that period permitted but not required.
    sometime later, the BOD changed its mind, and forbade the naming of any
further sheriffs. however, it did grandfather in all the sheriffs stil
extant, with the proviso that when any sheriff's post became vacant (e.g.
the title-holder moved away) it would be flushed.  when last we discussed
this matter, Yosef thought he was the only ceremonial sheriff still in his
position. About all he does as sheriff (besides tell stories about it) is
to hold court at Smoking Rocks events -- which courts tend to consist of
awards for tourneys and other contests held at the events, and random
foolery.

    P.S.  As long as we're talking about titles, what is the title of the
    heir of the coronet?
i think this varies from principality to principality. i believe i've seen
the heirs to the Coronet of Drachenwald called at various times the Tanist
& Tanista and the Heir & Heiress.

The fighter ID cards (in the Midrealm, at least) will be expiring at
the end of 1988.  As a number of blank cards were stolen at the War
these cards cannot be extended for any significant amount of time and
must be replaced (Midrealm only; I don't know what other kingdoms are
doing).

The question is this:  is there a way of merging information from a
fighter database with an image of the ID card and then printing the
combined image on a laserprinter that will accept light card stock?

Greetings gentles!

This past Saturday, East Kingdom Crown Tourney was fought in
Brewerskeep, just north of Concordia (Albany).  The victor and heir
to the Eastern Crown was Duke Morgan Sheridan, who fought for Lady
Maurya Etain Sableswan.  

The other finalist, and therefore now Admiral of the Armies, was Duke
Ronald Wilmot.  He was defeated in four bouts of a best of 5 final.

The tourney as a whole was well-fought, courteous, and chivalrous.
Although the day was cold, everyone seemed to have a good time, and
even that problem disappeared once we went in for the wonderful.

	Arval.

Subject:  CLARIFICATION OF REMARKS

Greetings!

I should like to somewhat clarify some of my previous remarks:  those points
made by William de Corbie are absolutely correct, and very much to be noted by
all.

The reasons I tried to point out how total the Board's authority is, were:  1)
as I have said several times already, not enough people realize that the SCA
is a non-member corporation, and the ramifications (both positive and
negative) thereof; 2) so it _would_ be realized.  It just seems to me that
this is a fundamental fact, and as such should be included in an individual's
opinion-forming process.

Also, as regards the description of the Drachenwald Curia:  from what I've
been reading, the structure might not be so unique after all (which I like the
thought of, personally).  I know it's not too terribly unlike the structure we
hoped to have here in Trimaris, although it didn't work out that way in the
end.

Thank you.

Subject:  BOARD

Greetings!

Having read William de Corbie's most recent remarks, I feel constrained to
point out that, should the Board choose, they _can_ with complete impunity run
the Society as a dictatorship, however unwise doing so would be.

However, as has been pointed out repeatedly, the Board _does_ read its mail.
The Board _has_, of recent times, shown signs of changing its viewpoints and
modifying the operations of the Society.  There are certainly more frequent
calls for member input than there used to be:  there used to be none!
And as Sir William points out, we need to tell the Board what we think,
otherwise they aren't going to know!  As the SCA, Inc. is a non-member
corporation, the only means open to the Populace-at-Large is the weight of
public opinion, as evidenced by mail.

We, the Society, need to continue and expand upon such forms of communication
amongst ourselves as this network.  Furthermore, if any or all of us is to
comment effectively, we _must_ find a way to know more about what's going on
at the "uppermost levels".  But if any of it is to count for anything, we must
communicate with the Board as well.

Thank you.

A clarification: Lady Cher de Bellevue writes that the BOD *can* with
complete impunity run the Society as a dictatorship. I am aware of that,
but I was trying to point out a different thing. NO board of ANY volun-
tary society, including the SCA, can run their society in a manner that
seriously displeases the members, at least not for long. Sooner or later,
the members will simply leave.

I believe that the BOD must be aware of this, and it works as a final
check on all dictatorial tendencies. If they would get to abhorrent,
there is *nothing* that could stop us from leaving the SCA and forming
a different society with the same purpose and activities.

I wanted to point this out because it serves to reduce the level of
paranoia (which has been rampant in some postings on this net).

Subject: Curia in Drachenwald
Message-ID: <881031215010.14.CONS.ELF@AIDA.UU.SE>

The Law of the Principality of Drachenwald states that the Curia
consista of the Coronets, their successors, the Greater and Lesser
officers of State, the Territorial Baronage, all Royal Peers resident
and all Peers of the Realm resident in Drachenwald.

The Coronets cannot change the ongoing body of laws without an
approving vote of 2/3 of Curia.

The Coronets can make Edicts without asking Curia, but Edicts may
not repeal Principality law (or higher laws), and they last only
for the duration of the reign.

Curia must be held at least once per reign, but there are usually
two or three Curia meetings in every reign.

Comments:

This may seem unusually democratic for the SCA. The reason is the
special situation in Drachenwald, where a great part of the popu-
lation are US Army personnel who come from many different Kingdoms
and only stay for three years. This means that we often get Coronets
who "grew up" in different Kingdoms and are used to traditions other
than those of the East.

In the past, it has been a constant problem that every new Prince
and Princess would immediately set to work changing the laws of
Drachenwald to be exactly like the laws of the Kingdom or Princi-
pality they came from.

It has been necessary to reduce the legislative powers of the
Coronets in order to maintain some form of stability in a group
with a very transient population.

There has been much debate about this system, and the latest info
I have says that some changes have been proposed. The new forms
allow the Coronets to change a law without the consent of 2/3 of
the Curia, but any such law change is subject to renewed vote on
the first Curia of the next reign. If it still does not get the
2/3 majority, the law will immediately revert to its previous form.
This gives the Coronets full legislative powers, at least for their
reign. I don't know if this has passed.

Subject:  TO PAY OR NOT TO PAY?

Greetings!

I should like to state, by way of my own defense (Kwellend Njal, please
note)  that when I joined the SCA, I had little money, having just finished
both school and contracting pneumonia!  I had one outfit, no cloak, one bowl,
and one goblet (which had been a gift) for about the first year.  Membership
costs at the time were either $10 ir $15; I forget which.  And paying that
membership **HURT** financially!  But, since I truly believed that truly
belonging meant paying up, that's what I did.  After all, if _no one_ payed
their dues...

Moreover, neither I nor anyone in my Barony tells newcomers they _must_ pay
up; rather, we urge them to spend some time in the SCA, and then decide.

So, you see, I _have_ been there, and I _do_ understand.

I should also like to point out to Milord Kwellend that he and I disagree less
than he might think; I hope he has read my more recent comments.

Thank you, one and all!

Subject:  TRIMARIS CURIA

Greetings!

Since the discussions and descriptions of Curias around the Knowne Worlde have
been continuing, I thought I would add a description of Trimaris' Curia.

First, how our Curia system developed must be understood.  Given Trimaris's
geographic shape, we have always been isolated, and therefore somewhat
maverick.  From our earliest days as a part of the (then-)Principality of
Meridies, there was a pervading feeling that the Society belonged to _all_ of
us, and that everyone should therefore have a voice.  So, we invented "The
Trimaris Concilium", which was basically a glorified, organized Town Meeting.
Any issue affecting Trimaris as a whole was discussed, and a consensus
reached.  For example, when Trimaris decided to petition for Principality
status, it was a consensus decision.

In later years (and to this day), this evolved into the Curia.  Curias are
viewed as "business meetings" of a sort.  The Crown brings up any matter upon
which They want group input, and any Kingdom Officers may report and/or
conduct necessary Corporate business.  Any gentle may with the Crown's
approval register appropriate business as well.  The Crown and Seneschal
generally chair the ensuing discussions, which are open to all Trimarian
citizens.

Apart from the Curia is the Witan, which consists of the Royalty, Royal Peers,
and Kingdom Officers.  It's function is to allow the Crown to meet with those
who are "the voices of experience" in a more private manner, and to seek their
advice accordingly.

Upon rare occassions, we have held Town Meetings (for lack of a better
moniker).  These meetings are attended by the members of the SCA, Inc.:
precedence and title go out the window for the moment.  They are chaired by
the Kingdom Seneschal simply because that office corresponds most closely to
the mundane office of President of an organization.  These are also consensus
building meetings, with a view towards eliminating the formality of a Court-
like setting and the occassional nervousness that may create in gentles who
might speak more freely in this sort of setting.

                                   Yours in Service,

                                     Cher de Bellevue

Greetings,

      I am Lord Benjamin di Rosa of Aldea.  A Carolingian expatriate currently
going to grad. school in Philadelphia.  While I was an undergrad I held a 
baronial office (herald) and so was forced to be a "card-carrying member".
The $20 was not a significant hardship for me but I could see it being such 
for other students.  I partially resented the feeling of "taxation without
representation" being forced to pay dues but not having the feeling that I
had the slightest say in the governing of the organization.  No matter what the
BoD did, I was required to "contribute" dues if I wanted to remain pursuivant.
Now we all know where taxation without representation can end up...

     In response to comparing membership dues to velvet garb and trim:
as a good MBA student, I've been learning about "utility theory".  For the 
most part, I find velvet garb has higher utility than membership.  At least
the velvet is soft and fuzzy, I don't derive a great deal of utility from the
board's purchasing a computer,saying random foolish things to the media, etc.

board's purchasing a computer,saying random foolish things to the media, etc.
Now admitedly a fop might place higher value on velvet and trim than others,
but you get my point.

I remain eager to hear from anyone with anything interesting to say...

Sir Alan's recollections match mine very well. It's true that the
Middle Kingdom's Curia doesn't publish their minutes, but some
years ago it was established that these minutes, like the other
reports and such that an office generates, are part of the public
record once they are approved by the next Curia. Kingdom
residents can ask to see them, altho they might have to pay the
photocopying fees, or be asked to read them at the officer's
house, and the Curia has the right to freeze or seal the records
of certain meetings.

Apparently the big reason this advise and consent method got
questions from the Corporate level is that it conflicts directly
with Corpora, which says that the Crown makes laws. It's been
suggested that folks who think the Middle uses a valid option
should write to the BOD, since they are in the middle of revising
Corpora, and suggest whatever changes you desire ......

Oops. This is essentially correct, but the Chairman, Gary Abbott,
cast the tie-breaking vote. Mitress Hilary does NOT have a vote

	As someone who was active for over 5 years before I could afford to 
pay dues, I think I have to answer this.  I first got active in the society
at a time when I had extra time, but no extra money.  I was able to fight
only because of loaner armor and gifts from people who helped encourage me
much as I now encourage new people.  I didn't have the money for memberships,
but I did have the time to help out the local chapter.  This doesn't only
mean students, I was just a low paid clerk at the time, living in an expensive
area.  No, I don't feel that those who participate without paying are taking 
advantage of a good thing, a lot of them are contributing things other than
money to our work.  Doesn`t that count for something?  The society can take
up a lot of resources other than money, I don't feel that someone who does
contribute of themselves should be *required* to pay.  I think that they  
should if they can, otherwise they miss out on some things.  But I welcome
any hands we can get.

a group of evil, wicked, mean, and nasty individuals who care not a whit about
the Society, or whatever.  I certainly don't; and I'm not talking off the top
of my head:  I've been carrying on quite a correspondence with the Trimaris
Ombudsman, and know that the Board does consider those matters brought before
them.

Rather, I think the problem is one of differing "world-views."  It seems to me
that the Board's views of the Society, and how it should operate, have not
grown as the Society has grown.  As I have noted in the past, the SCA now
encompasses a far greater number and variety of individuals than was ever
envisioned it would.  If you will, the demographics have radically changed.
The Board must change its viewpoint and methods of operating to account for
this; far more than they have.  It certainly is no longer practical to change
the type of corporate set-up the Society operates under, so we are forced to
look to the Board to change itself.

I have already, in recent remarks, spoken of what I feel to be the biggest
problems:  lack of [quick] response by the Board to problems; lack of
protection of the average SCA'ers rights; and abuses of Royal authority.  I
do not think I need repeat myself.  Rather, I would note that the Board, after
many years, seems to be acknowledging the problems, at last.  I should like to
see them now work towards real reforms, such as eliminating the power of a
Crowned Head to coerce or punish individuals at whim.  I should also like to
see the rest of us urging them to do so:  it would be to our benefit, I think.

Like Mistress Siobhan and others, I am disappointed to find that when the
Board _does_ ask for input on major issues, response is poor.  **ON THE OTHER
HAND**:  a problem I know I have when reading a "Call for Member Input" in
_TI_ is, if I don't get to it right away, and nothing reminds me of the
matter, then I forget about it.  Mayhap the Board could request the such
matters appear in Kingdom newsletters as well, for 2 or 3 months running (as
space allows). (Hmmmmm... I'll have to write another letter suggesting
that...)

As regards the membership question:  regardless of what is decided with
respect to AoA's, etc., I feel it should be noted that the SCA, Inc. is
surprisingly cost effective, despite whatever problems may exist.  _National
Geographic_ doesn't cost much less; there are newspaper subscriptions which
cost more.  My point is, it's all relative.  To me, the $20.00 covers an awful
lot, when you consider the insurance as well.  As for events:  just try going
off for the weekend in a mundane context for as little money!  Yellowstone
National Park costs $10 at the gate; Disney World costs nearly $30 for the day
for _either_ the Magic Kingdom or Epcot Center (not both).  Add on meals and
motels... >>>shudder!!<<<  And this from a Trimarian, who's been asked why
events down here are "_so_ expensive!"

As for the cost of membership being rough on student budgets:  it is, no
question about it.  Which is why my Barony, being largely comrised of
University of Florida students, started an "installment plan."  Gentles
wishing to make use of this deposits at least $1 per month with our Exchequer,
who holds the money.  When $10 has been raised, a check on the Baronial
account is sent off to register the gentle's membership.  The gentle continues
to pay off the other $10 as money permits.  And I've heard of other systems.
Point is, it _can_ be done.

I thank anyone and everyone who took the time to read this.

                             Yours in Service to the Society,

                                     Cher de Bellevue

Subject: The BOD
Message-ID: <881029012206.6.CONS.ELF@AIDA.UU.SE>

It is perfectly possible that much of the criticism against the BOD
is correct. But the question we should ask ourselves is not "why are
those jerks doing stupid things?" but rather, "how can we help those
people to do a better job?".

A voluntary society like the SCA can never be run as a dictatorship.
No board can seriously go against the wishes of the majority of the
members, at least not for long and on important issues. If they do,
the members will leave. Thus, even though the SCA is not democratic,
the board has to take the wishes of the people seriously.

Any member of any board of any society will do this to the best of
his/her ability. Board members are very aware of that their purpose
is to serve the members. I have been a board member in several smaller
groups (50-150 members), and I have found that no matter how autocratic
the constitution of the group may be, the board members always seek to
do what the members want, as far as possible. The biggest problem for
any board is to find out what the members really want.

The lack of such knowledge is a constant pain since members tend not
to tell their board what they think. Only a very few do this, and
those who do are often angry dissidents who are not representative.
Only after a decision has been made will the board find out what the
members think of it. If they like it, they respond with a consenting
silence. If they don't like it, they protest.

If this problem exists in a group of 150 members, it is probably
much bigger in a society of 15,000. So, good gentles, what we all
should do is to give the BOD the knowledge they need. Write to them!
Tell them what you think! Even if you are not extremely angry about
something or intensely engaged in trying to achieve a certain change,
write! The more feedback tqey get on their decisions, the better. The
more information they have on what is going on in the minds of the
members, the more likely it is that they will make the right decision.

BOD members are SCA folks just like any of us. They didn't become BOD
members so they could play God, but to serve the Society. If we don't
believe in their good intentions, we might as well leave the SCA right
now. But let's drop all the paranoia and believe that this is *our*
society and we all can have a say in how it is being run, because the
members of BOD are listening!

Once again, if you have any opinion what so ever about anything, write
to the BOD and let them know. They will appreciate it, I'm sure!

     Good for you!  In my infallible opinion, a very specific, precise
persona is worse than useless.  If you have decided exactly who you are
and where you're from, this makes for some very serious problems: why are
there so many people from different time periods, why aren't you living in
any place which even remotely resembles your home, etc.  It gets worse
when someone starts talking about "current" events in their persona's time
period and country as if they were talking about current events in their
SCA kingdom, or when a young person of the ninth century decides that an
older person of the tenth century is his/her grandchild, or when someone
describes their persona's fictional relatives as if they were SCA members!
     My own persona, which I've had for about five years, is an Englishman
of approximately the 10th-15th century, who lived for a while in Maldon
(a small city on the East coast), never did anything, and then came here.
I don't know (or care) what he used to be called, but now he's Henry of
Maldon because that's where he's from.  I also don't know (or care) what
his socio-economic status was, because that is now subject to change,
regardless of what it had been.  Over the last few years, my attitude
towards my persona has become gradually more minimalistic as I have come
to realize just how out of place my persona really is (my persona used to
be nominally 12th century, but I decided even that was too narrow).
     One final note: I'm tempted to change his name to Henry of Nithgaard,
and forget all about his place in the real Middle Ages.  This is certainly
more in accordance with where I'm really from, and would erase most of the
silly distinction between who I am as Henry, and who Henry was *before* I
was him.  The main reason why I don't is because of my general dislike for
"medieval" things which have nothing to do with the Middle Ages and were
invented in the SCA or brought in from Mundenmark (land of the Mundanes).
My feeling is that my name, at least, ought to be in authentic medieval
style, even if it does conflict with who I am in the Current Middle Ages.

Subject: Litany for a Crowning
Message-Id: <10449@s.ms.uky.edu>

Greetings one and all!

The following litany was used this past summer to lead Sir David de
Kunstanar to his crowning as Baron Flame.  This occurred at the Border 
Raids this year (an aside, something which I learned last summer is
that the Border Raids is the second longest running inter-kingdom
war in the Society, the longest being Pennsic).  I thought that you
people might enjoy seeing this.

The litany is, shall we say, a bit, um, well, non-serious.  To set
the stage.  The court that day was held under the trees at the base
of the field where the field battle was held.  This particular spot
was something of a natural ampitheater, and was quite nice after
the long hot day.  I do not remember when in court the ceremony
happened, but vaguely recall it being towards the end.

Now, the litany started with Father Geoffry and Bros. Stephan, Genesius
and Brochally (Only Geoffry normally has a priestly persona, the
others have other personas normally) in the rear of the ampitheater
going down the aisle chanting the litany.  It started with a feeling
very similar to the monks in Monty Python & The Holy Grail, then
changed feeling when they switched to English.  By the time it
got to the part done to the song by St. Disney (for his beloved
Brother Mickey), they were in a very jolly mood indeed.

As the four of them proceeded down the aisle, the populace of
The Flame followed along.  They were joined by the populace of
the Shire of Dragonsmark (my home shire) who, while not a part
of the Barony, is very closely related.  Now, all of us are
lined up in the 'stage'.  At some time a bunch of "sparkling
sticks" were passed out (mka "sparklers").  The litany finishes
and the ceremony proper begins.  Towards the end of the ceremony
the sparklers get lit.  But not before Queen Shana shows Sir David
the message on the back of his Baronial investiture scroll, that
the artist had used 24 carat gold leaf on the scroll and that
if Sir David were to roll this scroll up he would be hunted
down and have strange things done to him.  It was a very nice
scroll...  :-)

Now, there is apparently a tradition within the society having
something to do with Fire Squires.  It seems that particular
squires are nominated to be a Fire Squire during their time
as squire.  Sir David was one such person, which explains
the sparkling sticks.  Also if I remember correctly, at his
knighting at Pennsic last year they made use of fire in the
ceremony in some manner.  But I do not remember how.

I do know that for Sir Kumar's vigil that a lot of candles were
placed at various places around the tent wherein he was spending
his vigil.  (um, my campsite happened to be across the street
from the vigil so I had a good vantage to watch the proceedings).
Someone told me that he was also a Fire Squire.

Another thing.  Sir David is not 21, he's more like 30.  But that
will make more sense when you read farther down.

Finally.  I apologize if I have mangled the latin.  I do not
know any language except what I am able to infer from knowing
some modern French & Spanish.  The copy which I am typing this
in uses an all-upper-case font, but is apparently using larger
characters from that font when the author wants a capital
letter.  That is how I am reading it however, and hopefully
I am correct.

		LITANY FOR A CROWNING

Subject: The Letter of Dance

All right, I'm committed (or maybe I should *be* committed...). I have
decided that it is really and for true the time to start up a world-wide
newsletter for the discussion of Medieval and SCAdian Dance. What I
need now is *your* input; I figure that, given that I want the first
issue to go out in about eight months, I need to have the format firmly
decided upon in three or four. What would you like to see in such a
newsletter?

Broad items that I am currently thinking about include:

-- Reconstructions. Each issue would include one or two *very* in-depth
   reconstructions of period dances. These would be aimed at the new
   dancemaster and the experienced one alike, in the hope of improving the
   Known World's communication on this point.

-- Articles. These would cover pretty much any topic more-or-less related
   to Dance, including discussions of how to reconstruct period dance music
   and what does period dance garb look like. Any subject that someone wants
   to write about, that is at least loosely related to dance, would be
   welcome.

-- Forum. The letter column would be intended to be a give-and-take 
   discussion of dance. Anything and everything would be fair game here.

What else? What sorts of articles would you like to see? What balance would
you like to see struck between the for-the-novice instruction and the
somewhat more dense discussions of the intracacies of Dance? What broad
concepts have I missed?

Also, I'd like to hear from those who have dealt with mass tape copying
before. An integral part of the Letter will be an Annual or Semi-Annual
Dance Tape, so that people can *use* the dances that we'll be teaching.
To that end, I will need the help of: a) people who have existing public
domain dance tapes (or ones that they hold the copyright on, and would be
willing to let me make copies of selected songs); b) people with talented
instrumental groups that would be interested in reconstructing and/or
performing the music that I *can't* get existing available music for;
and c) people who know something about how to make 1-2 hundred copies
of a tape, how much it would cost, who to talk to about it, and things like
that.

I also need to talk to people who have set up small, independent newsletters
before. What are the pitfalls that I'm going to hit? Do I need to turn
myself into a non-profit thingamahoozie, or is the IRS likely to not care
about it? Does accepting advertising change the Letter's status at all?
What mysterious, unforseen legal liabilities am I going to hit, since
I'm determined to do this without the umbrella of the Society's bureaucracy?
Is indicia legally required, and, if so, what is required to go into it?
Reply to this paragraph via e-mail, since the answers are likely to be
simple and factual, and we needn't bother the SCAnet with them.

And lastly but *most* importantly, I'm going to need contributors. I
figure that, in order to get this thing rolling on a regular basis (an
issue every four or six weeks), I will need of staff of 15-20 semi-regular
contributors. Do you have something you would like to discuss? Would
you be interested in putting together the occasional reconstruction?
Talk to me. I've talked to a substantial number of interested dance
people so far, but many more will be needed. This is your chance to
really make a difference.

Let's hear some discussion of this! I'm *going* to create this newsletter,
come Hell or High Water, and now is the time for you to get your tuppence
in!

Subject: "Trich" and the Swimming Hole
Message-Id: <3@sir-alan.UUCP>

Mistress Rannveigr has been reading with some amusement and some
irritation the discussion on the net concerning "Trich" and the Cooper's
Lake swimming hole.  Her interest in Pennsic is not recent, as she has
served as East Kingdom Chiurgien and as War Chiurgien.  She was finally 
moved to produce the following missive.  As she does not have direct access 
to the net she asked me to send it for her.  The content is hers; 
the typing mistakes are all mine.

If there are public responses posted to the net she will eventually see them;
private responses can be sent to me at any one of the addresses below and
I will forward them to her.

						Sir Alan
---------Begin---------------------------
Q:  Can you get syphilis from a doorknob?
A:  Depends on what you are doing to the doorknob.

Q:  Can you get "Trich" from the swimming hole at Pennsic?
A:  Maybe you, but I'm not into that sort of kinky stuff.

Seriously, someone(s) on the net has (have) been perpetrating an odd
notion about Trichomonas (aka, "Trich").  For those of you who have
managed to miss it, the rumor is that trichomonas can be found in the
Cooper's swimhole, and if you went swimming at Pennsic, you should get
treated (or at least checked) for trichomonaisis.

For those of you who don't know, "Trich" is a parasite that causes the
MOST COMMON sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the U.S.  It is estimated
that 5 million women and 1 million men in the U.S. have trich.  (Because
of the anatomy, it is harder to infect males and to keep them infected.  The
cervix is an ideal home for trich, the penile urethra is only so-so.)  Trich
lives and grows in the urinary tract, vagina, or prostate.  In almost all
men, and in a large percentage of women, it produces no symptoms.

A lot of women and some men do get symptoms.  In men, this can be 
prostatitis, epididymitis, or narrowing of the urethra - all of which can
make peeing very uncomfortable.  Epididymitis may also produce sterility,
or backtrack and produce orchitis (swollen balls).  Not fun, though
fortunately rare.  The most common symptoms in women are "vag itch,"
painful urination, and a really foul smelling vaginal discharge.  It less
often causes atypical PAP smears, inflammation of the uterus or fallopian
tubes (PID), and may also cause sterility.  Symptomatic or not, a 
person infected with "Trich" can also infect his/her sexual partners.

Notice, I said SEXUAL PARTNERS.  Last I checked, trichomoniasis is 
STRICTLY a venereal disease.  You do not get it from swimming anymore
than you could get it, or any other STD, from a doorknob.  You get it -
if a may borrow a phrase from a certain seneschale I know - by making
like a bunny rabbit.

When did I last check? This morning, with three recent microbiology
texts, two recent parasitology texts, one MD-PH.D microbiologist, the MD
in charge of infection control in my hospital who is also a Board certified
specialist in infectious disease, and the chairwoman of the OB-GYN department
of my hospital.

I found one out of date textbook (two decades old, and repudiated by a more
recent edition of the same text) that did raise the question of whether trich
could be spread by the oral-fecal (eg., swimming-hole water) route.  So if
your doctor graduated from medical school a few decades ago, he/she may
think this plausible.  Research since then has shown otherwise.  As it
turns out, Superclass Mustigophora, Class Zoomatigophorea, Order 
Trichomonadida, Genus Trichomonas has three different and easily confused
species.  Only one causes disease, and that species can't live in water.

Trichomonas vaginalis (T. vag) causes "Trich".  It lives only in the
genitourinary (GU) system, and therefore is spread only sexually.  It
thrives in nice warm, moist tissue.  It dies rapidly on the outside.
Even if someone with "Trich" were to pee in the swimhole, the
parasites would die far too quickly for you to get it.

Trichomonas tentax is a rare type of trichomonas.  It can sometimes
be found on the gums of people who habitually do not brush their teeth.
It is believed it can live in water, but it doesn't cause "Trich".  It
does not cause any disease, not even cavities.  It just sits there on
the gums, waving its flagella, until you brush your teeth.

Trichomonas hominis (T. hominis) is a common type of trichomonas that can
live in water and I would not doubt can be found in the Cooper's 
swim hole.  This type of trichomonas is indeed spread to humans via
the oral-fecal (i.e., swallowing contaminated water) route.  When
ingested, it lives in the human intestine where it does absolutely
nothing except wiggle its flagella and confuse microbiologists as to
whether it is T. vag or not.  They look a lot alike, but if you can 
keep T. vag from falling apart long enough to look at it under a
microscope, they are really different.  T. vag alone causes the disease
"Trich".  T. hominis causes no symptoms, not even diarrhea.  And it
most certainly does NOT go wiggling up your privates to cause "Trich."

If you do have "Trich" both you and your sexual partner should be
treated.  The drug is called metronidazole ("Flagyl"), and is usually
given 1 tablet three times a day for one week.  (Alternatively, you 
can take 8 tablets in one day, but that doesn't always work.)

And if you do have "Trich", be honest.  Don't blame the swimming hole.
To borrow a phrase from Sir Horic and the War Puppies: "A good
squire always sheathes his sword."  Condoms (and monogamy!) prevent
most sexually transmitted disease from "Trich" to AIDS.

Message-ID: <881026210022.8.CONS.ELF@AIDA.UU.SE>

Good gentles,
I have asked around some more about the re-enactment groups in
Britain. It seems I was somewhat in error concerning the numbers
of people involved.
FODAS has about 700 fighters and 300 non-fighters in their groups.
The Norse Film and Pageant Society is not included in the FODAS
figures, which means we should add on another 200-300 people to
the total number of Vikings and Saxons. I don't know if there are
any Celtic groups in FODAS, by the way.
The total membership of medieval re-enactment groups in Britain
should be around 2000, twice the number I stated previously. And
the Cromwellian 17th century groups have 4000 members. A lot of
fops over there...:-)
Your servant,

The society's "computer" seems to have lost my membership.  I no longer exist

and never received an answer.  Who *should* I write?

(To be more precise, I stopped receiving publications in April and my membership
was supposed to expire at the end of September.  I *could* just send another $20
to "renew" my membership, but I'm reluctant to throw more money down a rathole
without finding out what happened to the *previous* rat bait.)

Subject: Fire Squires
Message-Id: <25910@tut.cis.ohio-state.edu>

As someone mentioned the term fire squire I feel it appropriate to clear
up some misunderstanding of the term as used in the Middle Kingdom around
these parts ( Ohio, Kentucky etc.)

There once was a Knight named Duke Sir Andrew of Seldomrest (he is still quite 
active but I was looking for that storybook opening line we all love so much
if you know what I mean ;-)) and he has had more than his shire of Squires.
(probably on the order of 70 or so) This may have something to do with the
fact that he is older than..., well suffice it to say that he was War
King at Pensic IV. Around this time he was also Earl Marshall of the Society.

Now that we have established that he has been around awhile he also has
a number of traditions, one of which is having a fire squire who is responsible
for keeping his "smokes" lit. This squire is traditionally his most junior 
squire. 

I can't help but wonder at what it must have been like in the days when 
Duke Sir Talymar was squired to Andrew and hearing
shouted across a Pensic War camp "FIRE SQUIRE !!" and having Talymar run with
a box of matches.
It is to much to contemplate ;->

I don't remember the exact figures Mistress Graidhne quoted me but this
is esentially correct.

The vote of the BOD on the issue of "allowing" kingdoms to require 
membership for participation in combat activities or any other was
a 3-3 split. With Hilary breaking the tie with a negative vote.
Therefore if I interpret this correctly kingdoms will not be allowed
to require membership.

The real shame is that they received so little correspondence about the
matter that we seem to find ample time to talk about between ourselves.
If we truly expect the BOD to represent the membership, then more than
8 people should take the time to let them know their opinions.

Mistress Graidnhe seemed surprised when I asked how the vote on that 
subject had gone because she was under the impression that few people
really cared.

O.K., O.K. I'll step down off of my soapbox.

P.S. Congratulations on receiving your Pelican at Middle Kingdom

 I have been involved in this thing for a year and still have a very 
vague persona.  

What I tell beginners that worked for me is first deciding WHERE you
want to be from and then WHEN can follow later.  After that, novels and
history texts and anything you can get your hands on should do...

My opinion of a persona is something that develops over time - like any 
mundane human being would.

    but I can't remember which university.  I met a few from around there
   so I know it exists.  Please let me know about your findings (e-mail wise)

Subject:  AOA'S & MEMBERSHIP; BOD

Hello to one and all!  I am new to the network, and so before making any
comments would like to introduce myself:  I am Mistress Cher de Bellevue,
CPel, Kingdom of Trimaris, Barony of An Crosaire (mundanely Gainesville,
Fla.).  I am an SCA-er of 12+ years, a herald, and my interests include
cookery, brewing, vinting, embroidery, and making people crazy by playing
"Devil's Advocate" (just ask Lady Majir; she's in my Barony...).

Speaking of Majir, as she mentioned, once upon a time it was "required" in
Trimaris that an individual should have submitted a device before being
eligible for an award.  What she apparently does not know (as it was before
her time) was:  this was while Trimaris was still part of Meridies, and
insofar as I can remember was never part of Meridies Kingdom Law.  Current
Trimaris Kingdom Law DOES require membership for award eligibility.

Now:  with further respect to the requiring of membership for award
eligibility--  it should probably be noted (if it hasn't been already), that
CORPORA does allow for Kingdom Law to be more stringent that CORPORA itself as
regards such matters.  Here, as in some other places it seems, there is a
feeling that if one is active enough in the SCA to have earned official
recognition of some/any kind, then one ought to be active enough to be a card-
carrying member.  And, if one can't be bothered sending in one's dues, then how
much of a member is one, really?  Is one just taking advantage of a good thing
without helping to support it?  What kind of armiger (read, "leadership
figure") is it that can't be bothered to be an official member?  And, if
membership costs are to be kept down, isn't it important that as many active
members as possible contribute?

Trimaris, by the way, tends to manifest this attitude in other ways as well:
events generally cost more for members than non-members, for example; and many
groups try to set up some sort of system for helping people out with
memberships when necessary and/or helping them save up for memberships.
Personally, I support these concepts.

BUT ON THE OTHER HAND...  can we/should we really do this, since legally the
only members of the SCA are the BoD, as the SCA is a non-member corporation.
This is something very important that not enough people are aware of despite
the fact that it is not only public knowledge, the Steward wrote a column
about it in a recent issue of "TI".  Although the corporation can use such
words as "member" and "membership," they do not mean what one would normally
think in this case.  Legally, we are all voluntary contributors to a non-
profit organization, and not much else.  So, I question the validity of in
essence requiring a contribution before an individual can receive official
recognition, or serve in a voluntary capacity (read, "office" and "officer").
Personally, I'm not real happy or real comfortable about being a legal non-
entity in my own club, that I support with my hand-earned wages.  And, if I'm
wrong about any of this, fine-- somebody tell me.

As to the Board:  whereas I can agree with most of Arval Benicoeur's
statements, I differ in my views with respect to the degree of involvement in
medieval affairs.

Firstly, I and others tend to think of the word "reactionary" when speaking of
the BoD.  In other words, the BoD tends not to act, but REact.  In my view,
this leads to a lot of "too little; too late."  It has often seemed to me that
if the BoD developed an attitude of "preventative maintenance," then a lot of
really nasty, Kingdom-level political (or otherwise) problems might have been
headed off.

Instead, it seems to me that what has often happened has been that serious
problems, which truly warranted Board involvement, have been "remanded to the
Kingdom for [attempted] solution."  Sometimes, that ends up reading, "allowed
to slide."  Such problems have often gotten truly out of hand, and/or resulted
in a lot of people getting hurt, and/or all kinds of other nasty consequences.

Coupled with this attitude are what I consider to be some serious flaws in the
corporate structure.  After all, the SCA happened largely by accident.  It was
never planned; rather, like Topsy it "just grew."  For instance, how often do
we hear of a Crown or Coronet making peoples' lives really miserable; of
"voting with your feet" (one way or another); of "taking 6 months'
sabbatical?"  I feel it unfortunate that the system allows this to happen,
without providing any real counterbalances to protect John and Jane
Averagesca'er.

So, I've about come to the conclusion that the Board needs to either involve
itself further in Kingdoms' affairs, or overhaul the system.  Since the former
would be horrendous, I hope that we someday see the latter.  The SCA has long
since become too large and too varied in its demographics to continue without
making allowance for member input, regional needs, and considering the
individual members' rights.  A broader outlook, more flexibility, and more
adaptation are needed on the part of the BoD, and as soon as possible.

Anyhow, such is my opinion.

But, to paraphrase Lord Spud:  none if it's more important than pizza.

                            Respectfully,

                                  Cher

I can see good logic in this argument, though I don't personally
agree.  I feel that the SCA is a purely volunteer organization.  If we
tell people that their work will not be recognized unless they pay up,
we risk alienating them, regardless of how much dues are.
Furthermore, $20/year dues ARE a hardship for many members, especially
college students.  I also can't quite see any relationship between the
level of membership & the amount of dues: What costs will go down if
membership goes up?

While I've been poor enough that $20 was a significant portion of my
food budget for the week, I was never so poor that I couldn't save
for things I found important, and I found that I valued my
membership in the SCA enough to want to save for it. I personally
get very griped when someone who just made new velvet or brocade
court garb tells me they can't even afford $6 for an associate
membership when I can see more than that sitting in trim on his or
her shoulders. Perhaps I've just always had different priorities.

For one thing, each of your newsletters costs less to print per
piece when there are more of you getting them. The economy of scale
is such that 1000 newsletters are substantially cheaper to print
than 450. (This is one reason why the big kingdoms always seem to
have more money to print their newsletters.) The same holds true for
TI. We can afford to put more pages in TI, advertising not-
withstanding, because there are now nearly 11,000 of them being
printed rather than 8,000 two and one half years ago. cost per
person is cheaper.
 
Other costs that are less: The Steward's, Secretary's, Treasurer's,
etc., salaries -- these costs haven't risen in several years, and
now more of us are paying for it -- at less cost per member.
 
If we recruit new members at an active rate, and if these economies
of scale continue, I can see the figures working so that the BOD
wouldn't have to raise the basic rate merely because of the rise in
printing and postage costs for the newsletters, as has happened in
the past <NOTE THIS IS MY OWN OPINION AND NOT "SECRET KNOWLEDGE"
FROM THE CORPORATE OFFICE!!!!!> But those economies are based on
projections that show the rate of membership continuing to climb the
way they have done over the past year, with over 100 new members per
month.

Greetings to all from a mundane who will
(hopefully) not be mundane for much longer!  Right
now, I'm almost all set to send in my dues and
start getting Official Stuff sent to me.  There's
just one small problem...the spot on the form that
says "Society Name".  I have a few rough ideas
about a persona, but I'm curious about what you
more experienced folk might have found as useful
reference books on the clothing, music, arms,
armor, etc. of various medieval cultures.  We have
a great library here at Princeton, but much of the
source material is of great academic interest but
little practical help.  Time-Life books never did
a "Life in the Middle Ages" series, did they?
(:-)  Any information on particular books,
authors, etc. would be greatly appreciated.
 
 
If anyone cares, I'm tentatively planning on
becoming Brian mac Cionaith, an early 10th century
Scottish Pict/Celt.  Anybody have ideas on
finding/manufacturing/purchasing a decent torc?
 
 
Thank you all kindly.

get very griped when someone who just made new velvet or brocade
court garb tells me they can't even afford $6 for an associate
membership when I can see more than that sitting in trim on his or
her shoulders. Perhaps I've just always had different priorities.

For one thing, each of your newsletters costs less to print per
piece when there are more of you getting them. The economy of scale
is such that 1000 newsletters are substantially cheaper to print
than 450. (This is one reason why the big kingdoms always seem to
have more money to print their newsletters.) The same holds true for
TI. We can afford to put more pages in TI, advertising not-
withstanding, because there are now nearly 11,000 of them being
printed rather than 8,000 two and one half years ago. cost per
person is cheaper.
 
Other costs that are less: The Steward's, Secretary's, Treasurer's,
etc., salaries -- these costs haven't risen in several years, and
now more of us are paying for it -- at less cost per member.
 
If we recruit new members at an active rate, and if these economies
of scale continue, I can see the figures working so that the BOD
wouldn't have to raise the basic rate merely because of the rise in
printing and postage costs for the newsletters, as has happened in
the past <NOTE THIS IS MY OWN OPINION AND NOT "SECRET KNOWLEDGE"
FROM THE CORPORATE OFFICE!!!!!> But those economies are based on
projections that show the rate of membership continuing to climb the
way they have done over the past year, with over 100 new members per
month.

Message-ID: <881023191407.13.CONS.ELF@AIDA.UU.SE>

Coranna Foxworthy of Cavan asked me to give some more info on medieval
and dark ages groups in Britain. I am no expert on these, but here is
a summary of what I know:

The biggest dark-ages group in Britain used to be the Norse Film &
Pageant Society, which was founded in 1971. They have a little over
200 members. This group does not belong to FODAS. They fight with
blunt steel weapons, but the fighting is mostly for show - blows are
pulled short, and most of the training seems to aim at how to make
fights look realistic without actually hitting. They refuse to per-
form their shows with other groups, because the fighters of other
groups are considered unsafe.

FODAS (the Federation of Dark Ages Societies) is a national organi-
zation for the cooperation of various member groups. At present about
15 groups in Britain belong to FODAS, plus a couple in Denmark and
West Germany. I only know the names of two of the groups:
1. The English Companions - an Anglo-Saxon group mostly devoted to
the arts and sciences. They have a very nice newsletter which is
often done almost entirely in calligraphy! They are very interested
in the Old English language, placenames, arcaeology etc, but as far
as I know they have no fighting and not everybody wears garb.
2. Reglia Anglorum. This is an Anglo-Saxon re-enactment group who
fight with steel weapons (demos only) and aim at 100% authenticity
in costuming etc.

There are also several viking groups. The total number of active
vikings & Saxons in Britain has been estimated at 1000, whereof
half are fighters.

On the medieval side, there are also something like 1000 people
actively engaged in various groups like the Plantagenet Society,
the Richard III society and others. They have no national federa-
tion like FODAS, so it is more difficult to get a grip on what
groups exist.

It is also difficult to tell the difference between public groups
where anybody can join for the fun, and more exclusive groups, where
you have to be mounted or professional jousting and show companies.
I know of four medieval groups:
1. Plantagenet Society. Re-enactment of the High Middle Ages.
2. Richard III Society. A more literary group, devoted do the
glory (and innocense) of that infamous king.
3. The Knights Templar. Crusaders, devoted to charity, chivalry,
courtesy and everything to do with the Crusades and the Orders
Militant.
4. The Sun in Splendour. A group devoted to the late 1400s.

There is also a group called "The Barony of the Far Isles" who
started out as an SCA branch but broke off from the Society because
of some controversy, long ago. They still fight SCA-style, and those
SCAdians who have visited their events have been impressed by the
standard of costume and behavior. Obviously, most British groups
are very much into authenticity.

It is possible that the existence of Tolkien groups has helped to
keep European medieval groups free from Fantasy tendencies; people
will join the group that comes closest to their own personal pre-
ferences, and if they want both viking combat and elvish poetry,
they will join two groups. The SCA on the other hand tries to be
as broad as possible.

Historical re-enactment is a big thing in Britain, but most of it
is 17th century (Cromwells wars, the Society of the Sealed Knot)
and later. The Cromwellians have some 2500 members.

On the European continent, I have not found any dark ages groups.
There are some medieval groups, but most of such activities are
public pageants staged by (and paid for by) towns that have a
medieval history. Shows are mainly to attract tourists and for
the locals to have fun. There are fairly large jousting groups
in Germany, Poland, Hungaria, France and Spain. Italy has more
renaissance pageants, almost no truly medieval as far as I know.

That is really all I can tell you.

William de Corbie

   Good day, good gentles.  I am currently researching the history of the
fork, and I thought that there might be someone that has had a similar

Subject: Post BoD-Meeting Thoughts

Introduction:
In view of the recent messages posted here concerning the BoD, I would
like to make a few comments. This is the Monday morning after the
BoD meeting in Lions Gate, An Tir - my home barony.  I met and talked
with BoD members on Thursday evening, Friday evening, attended the meeting
all day Saturday and served and danced at the revel following the meeting.
I had to opportunity to at LEAST smile and say hello to most of the BoD
members and in a few instances hold extensive discussions with them.


Comments:
Thursday I disliked them. I came away feeling ignored and like I might
as well not have gone.

Friday I met more of them and thought "Gee, they aren't all like last
night, maybe this won't be as bad as I thought."

Saturday I watched them do their work. I find the BoD to be very much
concerned for the welfare of the SCA as a whole. Difficult decisions
are not made lightly and are discussed (and argued) at length.

Quote from Board during Saturday Meeting: "We're all just a bunch of
boring, sincere people [pause] and well-meaning."

My opinions:
1) The BoD is _NECESSARY_. There MUST be a mechanism to make Society-Wide
   policy statements.

2) The BoD will never be able to make a decision that is popular with ALL
   people. Someone will always disagree with the BoD - unfortunately, those
   who disagree seem to be very vocal about it.

3) You have no right to say "The BoD is Bad" until you are well informed.
   You must have read the BoD minutes. You must have attended a BoD
   meeting or spoken to a BoD member or at least corresponded with a BoD
   member.

4) There is a fairly major communication problem between Joe Populace and
   the BoD. While final decision *results* are communicated, often the
   *reasoning* that lead up to the decision is lost in transit.

5) Travelling to a BoD meeting is not a holiday. It is business. These
   people WORK.

6) The folks on the Board are *nuts* :-) :-) :-) :-) It is beyond me why
   they would agree to take a job that involves MOUNTAINS of paperwork,
   phone calls at 2 a.m., being the target of much hostility and
   unpopularity AND the job is expected to last 3+ years.

So.

This might be a workable solution if seneschals didn't have
anything else to do. As you probably don't know, the seneschals
have a monthly report due to the Steward as well as being
responsible for all the paperwork to keep the kingdom running. In
the Middle it takes about 15 hours a week, including phone calls
and paper pushing. (If you're interested, order the Seneschal's
handbook from the stock clerk. It only costs a couple of dollars
and is very enlightening...)
 
In fact, the seneschals are so busy that we don't trust them with
the disbursement of our funds: the Treasurers do that, under
consultation with the Seneschals, other officers, and Crowns. The
Treasurers are ALSO too busy to take on this task -- if you've
ever seen your local treasurer's forms for the yearly or
quarterly report (and it's sobering to look), then multiply that
by the number of groups in your kingdom, PLUS being responsible
for the kingdom travel and expense and regalia and whatnot funds,
you'd see that the Kingdom officers are pretty well overburdened.
 
As for the idea of having a Kingdom registrar, we might someday
come to that. But with folks receiving both the Kingdom
newsletter, TI, and many folks (about 4000) getting more than one
newsletter, plus Complete Anachronist, well, that's a logistical
nightmare. I'm pleased that the new computer system will be able
to handle this nightmare better than the old one will. (For those
of you who don't know, the old system is a COBOL hand written
database Handler. The new one specifies a commercial database
management language like D-base or R-base or Foxbase or.....) At
any rate, with our current rate of growth (the Middle added 56
new labels this month) centralization seems a good way to keep
everything timely and straight.

I'm *very* sorry but not very surprised to hear this. I heard it
a lot from the folks in An Tir this weekend (with surprise in
their voices as they were discovering that the Board members are,
as one wag put it, "Boring, well-meaning, and sincere." )
 
What worries me as well is the perception that you, Lord Michael,
are "down there" in some way. Maybe it's a reality, but I'm not
convinced it should be. I'm the society chronicler, but I am
sobered by what I learned from the people of Lionsgate this
weekend. That happens to me all the time -- and I know it happens
to most of the other Corporate officers. Most of the Board
members seem to be very sincere about hearing and listening to
input from everybody, not just peers and officers and Royals.
 
Until I started trying to find out how things run, I, too, felt
the "big-bad-BOD" was trying to ruin our fun. As I found out
more and more about how things really work, I find that what we
really have is a set of rules or guidelines on which we build our
own Kingdoms and our own concensus. Most of the time a seneschal
of a local group really is powerless unless she or he has the
support of the group behind her or him. I constantly hear from
the Board, as I work on the Publications Policy, that we have to
leave things open for the Kingdoms to do themselves, because we
don't have the right to restrict x or y. (I also hear from Burnt
chroniclers who want this or that rule more restrictive, and to
which I always respond "We can't legislate courtesy" or "we can't
make the Kingdoms do that.")
 
I've found that it's the people who have taken the time to see
how the clockwork runs (even if it's not their slightest desire
to take an office at any level) who begin to feel more what's
going on. Even just reading the Board minutes can help expose you
to the fact that the Board is composed of people from all the
kingdoms and who vary widely on their opinions. (They are pretty
well unified in terms of process, and the rights of the SCA
folks, which they are all adamantly defensive of, even if they
don't always agree what to do about it.) Knowing how the power
flows in your own Kingdom can help you understand why things
happen the way they do, and what your role in the greater picture
is. I also recommend exposure.
 
I confess that before I went to An Tir this weekend (and before I
went to the West in April, and Atlantia in June) I had lots of
preconceived notions that everyone felt the same way about things
as I/my local group felt. The more people I meet and hear (and
the More SCAnet letters I read) the more I learn.
 
As a concrete example, before I went to Lionsgate I thought I
understood what Canadians thought about their mail delivery
pretty clearly. What I discovered was that I understood what
Ontarians and Nova Scotians and Quebeqois think about their
newsletter delivery. I also found out (Hold onto your hat,
Mitchell McBain) that the reason the An Tir Canadians are happy
with their newsletter is that their Chronicler mails their
newsletters about a week before the deadline -- that is, about
the 14th of the month. The delivery isn't any better to Vancouver
than it is to Toronto or Montreal, but they start sooner, and so
the Canadians get their newsletters on time every month.
 
I'll admit to being a cheerleader for the Board. I've been very
suspicious about what working with them might be like, based on
horror stories both heard and experienced. But this Board, (and
the composition changes slightly every time we get a new member)
are really dedicated and sincere people. I don't admit to being a
yes-woman. There are things I am very opposed to that the board
did this weekend, for example, even tho I can see and understand
the reasoning behind it. But they are open to comment and open to
people's reasons.
 
I also admit to being a gadfly for getting information out. I'm
currently pestering the other corporate officers to write
articles for TI about what they do, and I'd like to see the BOD
write some process-related articles. I'm adamant that the SCA
Coporate Officers and BOD manuals (which opened my eyes, let me
tell you!) be listed on the stock clerk's form (the BOD directed
the Stock Clerk to list it at this meeting, as apparently none of
us realized it hadn't been!). These two little manuals (printed
and sold together for about $3 US) let you know what your're
supposed to be able to expect from your ombudsman or a corporate
office.
 
I'd also like to cheerlead folks to write to the Board. Every
letter gets an answer, and many an answer gets discussed with the
rest of the board. They only got EIGHT letters (all positive, by
the way) from people about the membership issue. More than 8 of
us talked about it here, I'm sure. We can't make this society
ours without our input. If you think the Board is doing
something, WRITE!

Subject: Quote from Washington Post Sunday Magazine article by Alex Heard
Message-Id: <14146@mimsy.UUCP>

I am forwarding, for your amusement, this excerpt from the article
"Some Not-So-Civil War Games" by Alex Heard, published in the October
23, 1988 Washington Post Sunday Magazine Section. The article is
generally about historical re-creationist groups. I'm quoting only the
section which referred specifically to the SCA.

    It's like this: I have problems with historical reenactment buffs.
    Of all types. Partly because they yak self-righteously about their
    motives but never admit "It's fun wearing a costume, and I find
    that I have more success meeting [men/women] when I'm NOT 'just
    being me'." Partly because they brag about authenticity
    . . . but never, ever reenact things like, oh, hammer-'n'-knife
    dentistry and dying of diptheria. And partly because . . . well,
    they just bug me, all right?

    It all started in college. There was a female graduate student who
    often sneaked up behind me and yelled, "ARE YOU READY TO JOIN THE
    SOCIETY FOR CREATIVE ANACHRONISM?" The second time this happened, I
    responded with fire-drill efficiency -- viz, a wobbly-kneed (yet
    speedy) dash in any unobstructed compass direction. But the first
    time I stupidly asked, "The whaat?" She explained: . . . "We feast,
    We practice the rituals of courtly love. And most important, the
    knights engage in chivalric combat to establish hierarchical status
    and bring honor to the ladies . . ."

    Suddenly it was all chillingly visualizable: horny grad students
    gathered in a big tent, where they partied the old-tyme way --
    ripping up roasted chickens, burping a lot and letting juices spill
    down their chins. The guys would be those tubby, purple-lipped,
    bearded types who spent their youth playing week-long war-tactics
    board games. They would suit up in homemade armor and clang it out
    with wooden swords while the ladies -- clad in, brr, extra-sheer
    damsel grab -- reclined on pillows, sighing at a songbird in a tiny
    cage and . . . sketching it . . . as they waited for Sir Michelin
    Man to stagger home and sing some dialogue from "Tristram and
    Isolde". (And please don't accuse me of unfair stereotyping. I
    eventually wrote an article about the society and found I'd erred
    on the side of not being alarmed enough -- namely, I hadn't counted
    on the constant yelling of, "Serving wench! More mead!").

The remainder of the article goes on to bash a Civil War reenactment
event he intended.

From: MALICE@ISIS.MIT.EDU
Subject: Awards for paid members

Noone is likely to take awards or registered devices away from people who's     
memberships lapse, because the bother of keeping track of who currently is and 
 who is not paid up would be much greater than its worth. (think of what would  
happen if someone registered a name and device, lapsed, and re-upped only to 
discover that someone had submittet a conflicting device in the interval)
  Besides we want a chronological order of precidence. Its nice.  One of the 
good and *period* things about the SCA is that it has a history.    
and takeing away someones (pick one, AoA, Grant of Arms, Countyship) because 
their membership lapsed for some unavoidable reason (e.g. death) would be   
wrong.

Also alowing awards to be given only to paid members is not feasable because 
a) some times a king ( or baron) wishes to give an award to someone who is not 
only not a paid member, but not a member at all, because of some service they 
have done. This is usualy a court baronetsy. and b)  It is universally 
recognisied (or at least in the east) that geting awards out to the people who 
deserve them takes to **** long, and anything that was designed to make it 
more difficult would be disasterous.
(of course just because something is wrong, unfeasable or even disastrous 
doesnt mean the BOD wont do it)

Requiring that one be a member to register a device, however, is plausible and 
defensable (not nesessarily *right*, just capable of being argued about). It 
could at least be done without a major disruption.

But it seems to me that the heralds function is one that benefits everyone, 
whether or not they make specific use of it.  If people are going to use 
devices at all, it is obvious that they should be more or less unique.  It 
also seems clear that there should be some controll on the "period ness" of 
the devices.  The society has chosen a specific time&place do draw its 
heraldry from because 1) it exists, and enables them to register period 
devices in an orderly way.  2) the time&place chosen is close the the center

not beleive there is yet a consistant and accurate way of formaly coding 
"artwork" so that it can be put in 1-1 correspondence with a verbal 
description (blason).  (my recommendation to anyone who wants to use a peice of "artwork" as a device 
is that he/she *use* it as if it were a device until it *means* him/her.  Take 
the risk that someone elsewhere is using something similar.  Hope that he/she 
makes it to the top of Crown lists first.  Someday some herald is going to get 
drunk enough to try to blason it.)
Having the name i chose be documentable feels good.  Being able to identify 
people and their things their tents by their device or banner is great! and 
useful. and adds to the period feel of things in general.

heralds are a hardworking and under-appreciated lot

or interrupted 30 times during an event by them, or had their name/device

Subject:  A question/suggestion

I have a question in regards to mebership status. Why couldn't it be possible
for a kingdom level seneschal to function as an official representative of the
SCA for purposes of recieving money and making a member? It seems a much
fastermethod of conducting business you just get in touch with your kingdom (or
barony or shire) seneschal, give them the money and they give you a card and
reciept, you are a member effective immediately. The seneschal could then send
in the information as they get it (or at least on a bi-weekly period). The only
objection I could think of are unreliable seneschals but I just do not buy that,
if we trust them with the debursement of (shire/barony/kingdom) funds why cannot
they send money in?

And to siobhan yes from DOWN here it does feel that the BoD is completely
severed from our society.

Subject: British recreation groups

Greetings,
  In reply to a recent request for more info on British re-creation
groups I'd like to say that I've run into a few groups over there
that play this game too...
  One group, The Plantagenet Society, I ran into while visiting Dover
Castle.  They were doing an afternoon display for tourists by having
combat (with steel weapons), canon firing, the parading of warhorses,
etc.  They apparently put on several shows each year for a nice sum
of money.  At this time I was but a very newcomer to the SCA and was
not terribly inclined to ask many comparitive questions, get addresses
etc, much to my dismay, as I will be going back over to Britain for
a year in the near future, and know that there are no SCA groups near
where I'll be.  Anyway, I'd also be interested in getting contacts
with this group if anyone knows members of it.
  The second group is a Viking-times group, called by so an Old Norse
name which I must admit did not stick in my mind.  This group aims
for 100% accuracy in their doings which include public battles for
tourists and locals.  They also charge a fee for such, which I believe
the national group as a whole is putting towards the construction
of a replica ship.  This is on the word of a fellow archaeologist whom
I met while working in Orkney last summer.  I have his address if
anyone would care to contact him.   This group also uses steel in
its version of combat, and as I said, aims for 100% authenticity
in all of their garb, speech (Old Norse commands given in battle),
food, etc.  (I believe they speak English amongst themselves, saving
the Old Norse for demonstrations, but am unsure about this  :-)  ).

  A further clarification and appendation to my last note on this topic:
The groups which I last mentioned as charging for their demos means that
they charge English Heritage, or local councils, or whoever it is that
wants them to do the demos, not the spectators who are watching them.
  Also, I neglected to mention that I came into contact with a group of
merchants who were at the Dover display.  They were not part of the
Plantagenet Society, but were members of a group of people who lived
far off the beaten track in a permanent medieval lifestyle of some
sort.  I may still have the directions/address of this group.  If
anyone would like these, please let me know.

Good gentles-

     The question of going either province or barony has been proposed
in our shire.  Does anyone have advice, useful (amusing?) (horrible?)
anecdotes, or know issues that should be specifically addressed when
considering such a question?   We already have some very pro-barony
people.  Officially (rulebooks & such)  how are barons and baronesses
chosen?  How long is their term of office?  Or do we get to decide
such things?

The Middle Curia Regis still functions in this way.  It may be due in part
to the size of the Kingdom, or tradition, or whatever.  It seems to work.
There are minutes but they are not published.  The meetings are VERY dull
except when they are VERY frightening.  Speaking of Moonwulf, I remember
very well his wandering in and out of Curia at Crown Tourney of his second
reign (I was squired to him and for some reason none of us could leave
until Curia was over).  

One major issue between the Middle and other Kingdoms is the sovereignty of
the monarch.  I did a little looking and cannot find any justification for
excluding as non-period the old Middle arrangement which required the 
consent of Curia for certain major changes in Kingdom laws.  One source
discussed the conditions under which it was lawful to asassinate a
despot. But, then, we also had Michael of Boarshaven (who, last I 
heard, was in prison).

Well, that's not entirely the way it works, Bart, but I can see how
you formed this opinion.  East Kingdom Curia is intended to advise the
Crown on matters of law.  By Eastern Law, the Crown is required to
consult Curia before making changes in Law.  They are not required to
pay any attention to that advice.  Curia is composed of:

(1) Royal heirs, Reigning Princes & Princesses and their Heirs.
(2) Great & Lesser Officers of the Kingdom
(3) The sensechal of each group or his representative

Any one else may attend Curia, at the pleasure of the Crown, and may
speak if recognized by the Crown.  In general, Eastern Curia meetings
are open: I have never actually seen anyone denied the opportunity to
speak at Curia.

Curia meetings generally involve discussion of changes in law, Kingdom
policy, monetary problems/expenditures, and so on.  It is the formal
opportunity for officers and others to present business to the Crown
and for the Crown to announce its decisions.  Since Curia always runs
long and dreary, it is common for the Great Officers to discuss
business with others & with the Crown to reach a consensus BEFORE
Curia, thereby saving time IN Curia.  Often, important issues will be
discussed at Curia in several reigns before any final decision is
made.

The structure and operation of Curia reflects the actual political
balance in the East.  There are three estates (as it were): the Crown,
the Kingdom Officers (including local branch officers), and the
polling Orders (peerage and Kingdom).  Since the Crown is required to
consult the Officers before making law, and to consult the Orders
before making awards, but is not required to abide by their advice,
there is a balance between the generally very conservative opinions of
the Orders, who wish to protect their integrity, the less conservative
opinions of the officers, who mostly want the world to be simple and
quiet, and the entirely unpredictable opinions of the Crown.  The
Crown, of course, has absolute power; the officers have fairly
substantial power beneath the Crown, and the Orders have no practical
power aside from their ability to withhold consent to a given award.
Conversely, the Crown reigns only 6 months, officers serve 2 year
terms, and the order members are forever.  It may sound a bit odd, but
it works, and I have always felt it models medieval politics very
well.  After all, no real King ever ruled absolutely: His power was
always checked by the need to work with His Barons, work within His
economic means, and so on.

I'd like to use the previous discussion to make a quick querry on how things
are done in other kingdoms and principalities.  I mean, isn't part of the
idea here to find out how things get done elsewhere?

What I am curious about is: "How does your (current/former{pick one})
(Kingdom/Principality{pick as many as you like}) run a Curia Regis? Does
this follow any historically used model?" This phrase, Latin for King's
Council (right George?), seems to mean very different things, some
beneficent, some antipathetical, and some ambivalent, to gentles from
different areas.

We have indications from the East that they have one:

We have an indication of none in the West:

> Lord Arron Renyard

To elaborate, the East has a thing they call a Curia. It is more like a
cross between a Moot, a parliment, and a "Sockholders Meeting" from what
I've seen and heard. It is more or less open and anyone can speak to the
issues as in the old Danish/English/Norse Moots.  It is expected that
someone from each group (Seneschal(e) is the default M.P.) will attend to
help deliberate and voice the group's opinions on new laws, although more
than one member of the same group may attend.  It is often a lot of show
with various reports read off with little or no chance of prior review by
the attendees and decissions already more or less agreed on by some
executive commitee and the arguments pitched to influence the final result
to match.

On the other hand, the Middle used to use the term to mean a closed Executive
Commitee, along the lines of the later period King's Council or modern
Cabinet.  This committee is/was made up of the Monarchs (who I believe had
the final say after listening to advice), the Heirs (optional I think) and
the Great Officers of state. This was 1978-ish (I got my AoA for driving the
Exchequer to a meeting).  I got the impression from several officers that
how the meeting ran changed with the King, i.e. HRM Natan ran them like a
serious endevour, whereas HRM Moonwolf tended to be more casual and told a
lot of great stories (a real treat, he's a grand storyteller!). Again, this
is 10 year old hear-say, those meetings were _closed_ with no published
minutes.

I do not mean to pass on any value judgements. I was trying to state what I
have seen and am asking for input. Corrections are always welcome, since I
prefer to know the facts (If they don't fit my world view, I can always call
'em sampling error ;-).

So how's it done where you live? I mean, we're talking about the BoD, how
much do we know about our own Kingdoms?

Now wait a minute.  There have been computer professionals on the BoD,
too.  And few computer professionals anywhere agree on what the optimal

I don't know that the Board is considering this, and I think they
wouldn't, because the notion that awards would not be freely
given is as repugnant to most of the Board members I've talk to
about this as you and I are. It's been considered by some
Kingdoms, but I'm 75% positive (as positive as I want to get on
something I haven't explicitly asked about with the BOD!) that
it's not something that would ever come about.

Oops. The insurance doesn't just cover us when we are at events.
It covers us when we are at local meetings, guild meetings,
fighter, dance, and cooking practices, etc, etc, etc. There is
substantial discussion as to whether it covers our invited guests
at these ocassions,  and those folk who are at the event but who
are not SCA members are our invited guests.

Royalty and officers need to be members because they are legal
representatives of the SCA to their kingdoms or their groups, and
it's the only hold we have over them to insure they read the
darned information that comes out from the National office in TI
and in the Kingdom newsletters. If they are a member, they get
(Or must have access to) a newsletter, and it s their own darned
fault if they don't read the info. For example, the new
marshallate regulations (whether we agree with them or not)
needed to be known and understood by King, marshalls, etc. They
got published, and the affected officers are expected/required to
read things pertaining to the accomplishment of their offices in
the Kingdom newsletters and TI.
 
If some fighter got hurt and a Marshall had passed him, and that
officer didn't have to have access to the new rules, we'd all
have our butts in a sling with the legal liability. If that
Marshall is required to read the rules, passes something that's
dangerous, he might be the only one the hurt person could sue.
 
Or, for another example more closely tied to my jurisdiction: The
Chroniclers of all the Kingdoms have gotten hard information and
rules about copyright that they are supposed to pass to local
chroniclers. If Lord Henry Inkfingers, who is required to be a
officer and thus read the Kingdom newsletter, which has had lots
of information about what is and isn't legal for copyright, he
knows what is or isn't right -- supposedly. Then, when he prints
an entire newsletter of Hagar the Horrible cartoons, not only can
the local group have recourse to get rid of him (if they want to)
because he's broken the law and done something foolish), but if
King Features decides to sue for a million, they can only touch
Henry, not all of us. (probably they'd try, but that's another
story!!)

You won't get arguments with me about this, but I've been
impressed with the thriftiness and consideration of the current
board. They're very aware of how much money people give us and
how responsible we are for the proper spending of those funds.
I've been asked to reformat documents to make them print with
less pages, and to be careful to use the proper amounts of
postage. These are little things, I know, but I think they are
telling. And the fact that the new computer is not a mini, which
they bought last time at (I think) a scandalously large amount of
money, is a clear pointer that fiscal responsibility is "in" with
this board.
 
I shared this distrust until I began to work with people as
people instead of as "those idiots out west". I was very
skeptical of what the board might be like,and how things would go
with them. I was prepared to be at odds with "the Board" all the
time. I've been amazed to spend time seeing how they actually
make decisions, and seeing that they actually know a lot of what
people in the Kingdoms are thinking, instead of being isolated
"idiots".

Well, the Corpora says you can't add labels at the Kingdom
levels. We used to have a membership whereby people who just
wanted to get TI, an not have to be a member, could. About 5
people in the 6 years it was available asked to subscribe to this
service, which was publicized in library magazines, professional
journals, etc.
 
We do feed messages to the Chroniclers, but things like the
yearly tax report, the Corpora changes, etc, are required by law
(different laws, but things like the laws of incorporation and
tax thingies) have to go in the official society publication on a
regular schedule. The current end-of-the year fiscal report is 3
pages long -- I know, I just typeset it. And the lists of corpora
changes, etc, run 13 pages. (As a side note, you'll like the new
Corpora. It's cleaner, makes more sense, and is internally
consistent. It eliminates some stupid rules. Everyone will have a
chance to comment -- send in the order blank and be a participant
in your governance....) Your kingdoms would go broke trying to
publish that much extra crap.

Have you seen the new disclaimer? I'll type it in tomorrow. Local
newsletters are now de jure official, as they were before in
practice but not in law. The Board changed this (on Hilary and my
recommendations) at the last BOD meeting. I sent copies of this
new disclaimer to this newsgroup, and NOT ONE person responded.
 
People here have said that they can't see anything the Society
central membership does for them. Is that really true? Are
there no benefits to being a member of the Society at large?
Is what we do "up there" really that invisible?
 
These are serious questions. I invite your serious comment
(but remember that I get on a plane to Vancouver at noon on Thursday!)

    Siobhan the Society Chronicler

Subject: The Rolls Ethereal

 
			The Rolls Ethereal
			------------------
 
At long last, here is the first volume of the Rolls Ethereal! The Rolls
are intended to be a sort of "phone book" for SCAdians on the Net, at least
those who are interested in being in it. Anyone who considers themselves
SCAdian, and who has some sort of Use/ARPA/Inter/BIT/etcNet access is
welcome to send in an entry for inclusion.
 
The SCAnet
----------
 
Just in case a copy of this falls into the hands of someone who doesn't
already know about it, the SCAnet, as I refer to it here, is the amalgam
of a Usenet newsgroup and an Internet mailing list. Those on Usenet who
are interested can subscribe to the newsgroup "alt.sca"; those on Internet
should write to: sca-request@mc.lcs.mit.edu to request a subscription.
Note that these are redundant; things posted to the one should make their
way onto the other pretty quickly.
 
How to get into these Rolls
---------------------------
 
Those who want to be listed should send the following information to the
Editor of the Rolls (currently Justin du Coeur, justin@inmet.inmet.com):
 
1) SCA Name
2) Mundane Name
3) SCA location (eg, Kingdom & Barony/Shire)
4) Mundane location (eg, city and state)
5) Titles & offices, if any
6) Interests
7) Net address
 
Some comments on the fields:
 
-- The only information that *must* be sent for inclusion is an SCA or
   Mundane name, and Net address. All other fields are optional (most
   people supply them, but for the privacy concious...) If you don't
   have an SCA name yet, but consider yourself a SCAdian, that's fine;
   just say so, and send an update as soon as you come up with an
   SCA name; in the meantime, you'll be listed under the Mundane name.
 
-- Please keep the data short. There is only one line available for Titles
   & Offices. If you have been in the Society for twenty years, and have
   accumulated dozens of titles, you can probably consider yourself an
   honored member of the Order of the Etc. Titles or Offices that you are
   particularly proud of should be listed *first*; if I have to trim the
   line, I give preference to things in the front. Likewise, there is
   only one line for Interests. If you are a Jack of All Trades, just say
   so. Particular interests should be listed first.
 
-- Don't make too many assumptions about my knowledge. Even if everyone
   in the Kingdom of New Oz knows and respects the Order of the Hippo as
   the highest award around, it's quite possible that I've never heard of
   it, so *don't* abbreviate it to "OHip" without explaining what that
   means.
 
-- Mundane location does not mean full street address. It is simply
   intended as a general locator, so that people can figure out literally
   where you're coming from. It isn't very obvious on the Net, and not
   everyone is proficient in converting SCA geography to Mundane.
 
-- For the Net address, Inter/ARPANet format (mumble@foobar.site.domain)
   is *strongly* preferred; this is fast becoming a world-wide standard,
   and is a lot more compact than giving the entire linkage tree from the
   backbone. If you *must* give a bang-address (...x!y!foobar!mumble),
   choose *one* best path, and list that. Again, I'm trying to keep this
   down to one line (thus saving me some typing). Also, remember to
   specify which Net you're on; "mumble@foobar" could be Usenet, BITNET,
   or an abbreviated Internet address.
 
Format of the List
------------------
 
After giving some thought to the matter, I concluded that there is really
*no* common standard formatter for the Net. Therefore this file is flat
ASCII. The only liberty that I have taken is form-feeds (^L) between
sections. You may format it to your heart's desire (for Unix users, the
simplest thing to do is just say, "pr ethrolls | lpr" (assuming you've
saved this post to the file "ethrolls"); this will give you a perfectly
readable, if not fancy, output). If you decide to port this to some 
fancy formatter like troff or Postscript, I suggest making it available
to the public by announcing to the SCAnet that you're willing to mail
it to people. DO NOT re-post the newly-formatted version to the list;
having a dozen versions of the Rolls posted in two weeks would be a
*very* good way to get us in dutch with the administrators of Usenet,
as well as those at mc.lcs.mit.edu.
 
The format of a typical entry (I use myself as an example), is:
 
Justin du Coeur ( Mark Waks )
  Barony of Carolingia, East ( Boston, MA )
  Baronial Dancemaster, Keeper of these Rolls
  Dance, archery, dance, autocratting, dance
  justin@inmet.inmet.com
 
The first line is my names, with the Mundane in parentheses. The second is
location, also with the Mundane in parens. Third is Titles and Offices,
fourth is Interests, and Fifth is Net address. Entries are in alphabetical
order by *SCA* name; those with no SCA name are in order by Mundane name
at the beginning. If I do not have Location, Titles, or Interests, those lines
will be left out, so don't be surprised if many entries have only three
or four lines. If I got my formatting software right, everything should
fit neatly into eighty columns; no margins are allowed for.
 
Accuracy
--------
 
There are no warrantees, express or implied, on this information. I'm 
printing it as I got it, this edition, and have made no attempts to
confirm that the Net addresses are currently valid. If your information
is incorrect, or you know *for sure* that someone else's is, send a
correction to me (justin@inmet.inmet.com).

Abbreviations
-------------
 
In most cases, I have spelled out awards and titles fully. However, there
are some titles that are either a) so common, or b) so long, that I felt
it best to abbreviate them. I have probably not been consistent in when
I abbreviate and when I spell out; forgive me if this troubles you at all.
One or two group names are also abbreviated, for the same reasons as awards.
The following are (I think) all of the abbreviations used in this book
(Except for the few where someone did send me something indecipherable,
like "OHip"). I have provided brief explainations, where I know them.
 
Abbreviation	Full title
------------	----------
AoA		Award of Arms ("Lord" or "Lady")
BMDL		Barony-Marche of the Debateable Lands (East Kingdom)
CoD		Carolingian Order of the Daystar (Carolingia, East, Service)
CoM		Companion of the Maunche (Eastern Arts)
CoSC		Companion of the Silver Crescent (Eastern Service)
CoSH		Companion of the Sea-Horse
GoA		Grant of Arms
KSCA		Knight of the Society
LR		Ladies of the Rose (East, for former Queens)
MoL		Master/Mistress of the Laurel (Society-level Arts)
OBT		Order of the Burdened Tyger (Eastern Autocrats)
Pel		Master/Mistress of the Pelican (Society-level Service)
QoC		Queen's Order of Courtesy (East)
Terp		Terpsichore (Eastern Dance)

	***SIGH***
	Your distrust has been shared by almost all Society members since Day 1
-- or at least since there has been a Board of Directors.  During my entire
stint as Steard, it was richly merited -- a less buisnesslike crew I never saw.
I don't have much insight into the heads & motivations of the present Board,
but from comments seen here, I doubt things have changed much.

	A couple of words in mitigation, however:

	1)  The world of tort liabilities, state and federal tax requirements,
and the uniform commercial code are _much_ different than the worlds of
academic endeavours and fen politics that many SCA members are used to. Some of
the non-comprehension is on the members' side.

	2)  Unless the Corpora and Articles of Incorporation have been changed
drastically since my time, there is no provision that the Board listen to
_anyone_.  They are not elected -- they appoint their own successors.  Without
_guaranteed_ attention to member input, things can go to hell in a handbasket
very quickly.

	I tried to get a system of reporting set up, so that the Seneschals
would let me know what was happening in the Kingdoms (from reports received
from the Principalities, Baronies, Shires, etc.), so I could go to the Board
and tell them what was happening in the Society, and get needed changes made.
	The only two Seneschal(e)s who ever reported to me on a regular basis
were Roland Green in the Middle Kingdom, and Katharine Kurtz (who later became
Steward) in the Angels.  the Board was endlessly concerned with trivial
paranoia about access to the mailing list and flame attacks from various noisy
fen.
	I resigned in frustration, after gaining a well-deserved reputation for
arrogant irritability (aka govenment by atrocity -- they harassed me, I
committed an atrocity).

	Politeness and a willingness to hear what the other person is saying
(and not saying), as well as a willingness to cooperate and compromise go a
long way towards making an organization workable.  "Non-negotiable" demands are
a sure route to bruised egos on all sides, spiteful petty wars, and general
chaos (i.e. the Current Middle Ages).

  It is striking how very much this disorganization sounds like,

Subject: Finnish event...any chances???

To all ye who live in the Known World I bring my humblest greetings...
Let it be known that light has arrived on the shores of dark and
misty forests known also as Republic of Finland...
I am -as far as I can tell- the first SCA-member (foreign member) in
Finland and desperately but ah, so valiantly struggling to establish
a new prospering shire to spread knowledge and bring enlightment
to these gloomy regions...
I have planned ...note *planned*...to keep the first event in next
fall...
The event -so I have thought- should take place in....a castle.
A medieval castle, known as Olavinlinna (in swedish Olofsborg), which
is one of the most famous finnish castles and one of the most
authentic as well...
I have taken contacts to the authorities and to my deepest surprise
found out that the castle is rentable!...and for what price!!..
Even *I* , a poor student, could rather easily rent _the_whole_castle_
for a day.  There are some problems (such as the fact that castle
is open for public 364 days a year (closed at Christmas eve), so all
activites must take place outside the opening hours (10am-4pm)) but I
think they do not restrict the event too much.  Feast for instance is
not likely to start before 4 pm.
And the castle is not so small either.  King's hall can house c. 130
persons, Congress hall and another hall c.100-150 persons.  In addition
there is Bell tower Basement and Castlehouse.  The castle staff has
sole rights to make food, but are willing (and if I understood right;
interested) in making food according to given recipies...this will, 
naturally, cost a bit more...but I think it's worth of it..
The only place in the whole castle which cannot be rented is the room
which houses the actual museum but it is the small Gatehouse which is
out of the way in any case.
The castle can be decorated according to one's will as long as it does 
not violate the rules and regulations set by the National Museum Office
and stays within "the good taste" (which means that in general the castle
or any part of it may not be *damaged* or othervice harmed...but furniture
may be (re)arranged if desired and banners/flags may be added).
The castle itself is situated on the outside (or side) of the actual town.
It stands on a rock isle middle of the river and the bridge can be removed...
Between the town and the castle is a park, so there is some degree of
'privacy' on that side too (naturally the castle walls increase this
privacy notably..;-).
I am not *sure* whether or not there are suitable fields for tournament
nearby...but I will find that out...
Now...there is couple of problems.  I am a *beginner*...I will not deny it.
And there is *lots* of chances to ruin the whole thing.  I have contacts to
the autocrat of last Wisby event (in Nordmark) and on that side I'll mostly
rely on him...but any ideas, suggestions, warnings, etc. are taken with 
heartfelt thanks.
Secondly.  The becoming members are not very 'talented' persons...
and in general we're all beginners in this activity...so I do not know
do I dare to set up this event because there'll be little or no 'show'
on our side...
Thirdly -and this is purely my personal curiosity- how many of you out
there WOULD be interested of attending this kind of a event (remember
that Finland is FAAAAR away from United States...)?  Are there any chances
that this event could attract people?  Naturally members of Drachenwald
do not have so long way to travel...so are any of you interested?  
Or people from barony of Nordmark? (which belongs to the Drachenwald but
is so near to us that I think it deserves to be mentioned separately).
Please if anyone has anything to say of this subject, mail to me...so I
can decide is the event worth of it or should it be smaller, cheaper and
not_so_attractive...

Yours in the Society

Subject: other groups

Wow, I had no idea that Tolkein re-creation groups were so widespread. 

I am intrigued by the apparent number of medieval or dark ages
recreation groups in England.  ]ke, do you have an approximate number
of these, or a population guess?  There have to be several to have 
formed a federation.  I was under the impression that playing 
at being nobles was not a good idea over there, and that impersonating
a knight or bearing a heraldic device that does not really belong to 
your family was illegal.  They have advantages, however, in that they
probably get to hold feasts in whatever castles happen to be nearby. 
If anyone knows more about these English or European non-SCA groups, 
I would be interested in hearing about them.  In the West, the SCA is
really the only medieval re-creation group in town.  There is a
Rennaisance Faire, with whom we're constantly confused, but they are not 
so friendly with us as, say, the Texas Rennaisance Festival is with 
Ansteorra.  These other groups were unknown to me, as we have no
equivalents to Markland or Maryland Militas, or the kingdom of Acre, 
or the Tuchux.  On the other hand, I'm discovering Rennaisance guilds
scattered about that perform at various fairs, College holidays, and
festivals of whatever fruit, flower, or vegetable is In.  They seem to 
be more focused on a performance, and take real historical personas.

Amusing story of an intersection of two societies:

While the rest of the Kingdom was at Coronation, my squire-brother and
I put on a demo at a local Catholic university's Saint Claire Faire. 
There were but the two of us, and we had brought all our various
weapons for three scheduled fighting demos during the day.  A local
Rennaisance Guild (Saint Gregory's?) was also in attendance, in grand
array and british accents, with a young King Henry VIII.  They were
more fun to 'freak' than mundanes, because they had to stay in persona.
We would switch accents on them, call them futuristic, and generally
mess with their realities.  At our last scheduled demonstration and 
spiel, the King's Halberdiers paraded up with a huge chair and the 
King (and the king's mistress).  They were highly amused that we picked
up on the flowery language, bowed, and such, so the king decided to
watch the fighting.  Now I'm 5'5, 120 lbs, and John is 6'3 and huge. 
We made an interesting pair, and I took my billhook against John's
sword and shield.  The King's mistress decided she liked John, and 
gave him a brooch to wear into combat.  The King, not to be outdone,
gave me a ring on a ribbon, which they tied to my backplate.  Amidst
great choruses of "huzzah for the halberdier" we made ready.  John was
embarrassed by now, because they had been cheering for the 'underdog'.
Eric showed up and played Herald, and it was several minutes before
they stopped 'huzzah'ing long enough for us to fight.  We hammed it up 
for the crowd, and the Rennaisance folks lent great oohs and aahs to
the effect.  John bested me two out of three as the sun was setting.  
We made a lot of new contacts that day.

Also at roughly this point in time, the BoD also issued a financial report
with what seemed in our shire to be a rather large amount of "undeposited
funds." Where as there might have been a handy desk drawer for stashing
funds in, we thought that having them in a bank account (and potentially
earning interest) might have been wiser. None of us were accountants, so
perhaps this was a special term, but it was not expanded on in the report.
A letter was written by one member, I did not hear of a reply. Being an
evil cynic, the already minimal respect I had for the BoD dropped another
notch.

This is an actual general question: I have never had a chance to inspect the
Corporum, but several people who I do respect have indicated that it
effectively makes only BoD members members of the SCA, everyone else is
just a subscriber. Is this rumor, fact, or just an extention of the fact that
adverage Joe Mideval has no effective leverage in the way the society is run?

        How should the SCA be organized?

Subject: How should the SCA be organized?
Message-ID: <881013010453.8.CONS.ELF@AIDA.UU.SE>

In connection with the debate about paid memberships, some people
have expressed doubts about the value of SCA's national organiza-
tion. I believe that the national organization is a *very Good
Thing*. Let me tell you why:

I have been involved with various Tolkien groups for 15 years.
These groups all deal with the same thing: the "Lord of the Rings"
by JRR Tolkien. The groups occasionally get together for large
events, but there is no common organization. Now, while the free-
dom to create your own version of Middle-Earth is undoubtedly a
Good Thing, it is also true that the Tolkien groups would be able
to do much bigger and better things if they had a common approach
to the subject.

In one group you may find personas who are Orcs and other evil
creatures, while other groups have outlawed all the bad guys. Some
groups use "theatric" personas, i.e. Aragorn really *is* King and
sits on the throne - other groups consider personas as honorific
only. Thus, you may meet someone called "Prince Bungo Bagger" whose
squire or servant is "Gil-Galad King of Elves". Some groups have
fighting, others don't even wear costume and just sit around talk-
ing in Elvish languages. Some allow only Tolkien personas, others
allow all fantasy characters.

The same disparity applies to most historic groups. The British
Medieval and Dark Ages groups are a good exemple. Many of these
bear resemblance to the SCA in that they wear costume, re-enact
battles, do period calligraphy, dancing and music, etcetera. A
few years ago, they formed a national organization called FODAS
(Federation of Dark Ages Societies). The intention was to promote
cooperation, exchange knowledge and to bring all the groups
together for larger events.

However, every group has its own system of awards, peerages, her-
aldry, &c. Every group that fights has its own rules and safety
regulations. Some use metal weapons, others wood, some fight on
horseback, others on foot. Some groups are ruled by Kings by-right-
of-arms, others are democratic or they may be ruled by a Council
of Elders or whatever. Whenever there is a meeting, confusion
ensues as to what rules should apply, and even though FODAS have
tried to make up a set of minimal common rules, every such rule
causes grumbling somewhere. And if one group feels that their
wishes aren't being considered enough, they may just leave.

The greatest advantage of the SCA is precisely that we *do* have
a common, national organization which lays down the rules for
the whole thing.

I am a knight in at least three different Tolkien groups, but
each of these titles means a different thing, and it all amounts
to that such knighthoods mean nothing. In contrast, SCA knight-
hood does mean something, because there are 15,000 members and
perhaps an equal number of hangers-on who are familiar with the
requirements. People know that it takes a lot of work to become
a KSCA, and the value of peerages are recognized everywhere.

This is just one example of how valuable it is to be part of an
international system. Even though this system certainly has its
deficiencies, it is the common traditions and the common rules
which hold it all together, and make it into something *great*.

When Nordmark (the Swedish SCA branch) was founded, some of the
founders wanted to make it a separate, Swedish group. If we had
done that, we would have been able to lay down our own rules.
We would have had total power over the way to approach the Middle
Ages. But we would have become just another small, weird group on
the outskirts of nowhere.

Belonging to the SCA means that we have access to over 20 years
of experience with this kind of activity, and the accumulated
knowledge of many thousands of anachronists. When we joined the
SCA, we suddenly got 15,000 friends all over the western hemi-
sphere. Many of us have enjoyed the hospitality of members in
other countries, and an SCA member who comes to Sweden will be
guided around town, taken to events and will enjoy free accomo-
dation. This is not true of British FODAS members, however like
us they may be, simply because they don't belong to the same
organization. This makes them strangers, and contacts are much
more difficult to get.

If the national SCA organization was disbanded, we would face
the complete disintegration of the SCA into several small, in-
significant groups. It is probable that these would quickly
develop separate traditions and rules of such great disparity
that we would no longer be at home outside our own local group.
Neraldry and name conflicts would appear. Pennsic might no longer
be possible. Peerages and titles would lose their meaning. And
it would become much more difficult for new members to find us,
because there would no longer be such a nation-wide concept as
the SCA.

Therefore, good gentles, let us not cultivate our local and
personal preferences to such an extent that we become estranged
from each other. Let us build on the impressive structure that
we have created, and make it even greater!

Your servant,
William de Corbie

Message-Id: <Oct.13.14.17.54.1988.3606@ramones.rutgers.edu>

Lord Majir asks:

> I am curious - how is our membership fee being misspent?  Why this
> distrust of the BoD?  

OK, you asked for it...

The general feeling in the East (& Middle, in my experience), is that
the BoD spends too much time & money poking its nose where it doesn't
belong.  The BoD has had a tradition, as it were, of leaping in with
both feet, ignoring its own policies of non-interference and going
through channels, and then justifying everything afterward.  The
typical rationale has always appeared to be "We KNOW what's best 
for the SCA, and you don't REALLY want to know all the nasty details,
so we'll make up a nice-sounding excuse for what we've done."  Since
BoD members are chosen by the BoD, it frequently has appeared that the
BoD was a closed clique, uninterested in input from the rest of the
SCA.  Getting BoD minutes it not any help, since they seldom include
enough detail for anyone to understand what really happened, and since
the Corporate Office seems to try very hard to restrict access to the
supposedly public documents which the BoD used to make its decisions.

Some of this feeling surely grew out of the West/East animosity which
has always existed: all the BoD members came from the western
Kingdoms, and so did all the Imperial officers.  There was a strong
impression that their attitude was "The West is right, and who cares
about anyone else?"  This has changed in the past few years, and,
indeed, the anti-BoD feeling does seem to be lessening.  However, it
has not disappeared by any means.  

Specific complaints are that the BoD often makes decisions without any
attempt to consult the rest of the Society, not even its own officers.
The BoD ruling on heraldic sovreignty is considered by many as an
example of this attitude.   Another recent fiasco, dealing more
directly with money, was the last purchase of a computer system for
the Registry.  Against numerous recommendations by computer
professionals in the SCA, the BoD bought a terrible, expensive, and
immediately obsolete system, which it is now in the process of
replacing.  This blunder came at about the time the BoD decided to
double membership fees...  Little wonder many people reacted so
negatively. 

There is a strong prevailing anti-bureaucracy sentiment in the SCA,
and the BoD attacks that feeling directly.  Many believe that the BoD
should relinquish all power to involve itself in medieval affairs, and
should deal with nothing but the mundane (insurance and so on).  There
is a great deal of merit to this opinion.  The two functions of
mundane official body and medieval highest-court of appeals are
logically kept quite separate, and perhaps should not be handled by
the same body of people.  I doubt anyone will deny that the SCA needs
some super-Kingdom authority, playing the part, perhaps, of Pope and
Holy Roman Emperor, but that body should hold the interests of our
medieval world first, not last behind a collection of bureaucratic
necessities.  For example, membership & the Registry have caused
enormous problems for several Kingdoms recently with their
requirements.  This is a purely bureaucratic problem, and should not
intrude on the politics of the Knowne World.

I don't personally swear to all these ideas, but I'll admit I am a
true Easterner in most ways.  I invite argument.

Maybe I should use more smiley faces.

I do favour requireing membership fees. I do not favour requireing anything.
I do question everything and try to see both sides of an arguement brought
out.

For the reasons discussed with respect to the Tuchux incidents at the war,
I believe that all fighters should have and display a unique device. Such 
devices are reqistered with the heralds. Heralds should help. Given that
fighting is based on the theoretical standards of an early crusader (i.e.
chain mail and a pot helm), it is reasonable that the heralds use the practice
of that era. This obviously introduces a separation of persona and fighting
persona. I am not saying that this is so or even right, just that it is
logical.

My question to the world is, "What does it mean to have an AoA? What are the
priviledges and duties of someone with an AoA? What are the requirements, in
your area wherever it may be, for being awarded an AoA?"

In Trimaris, in case anyone is interested, one must be a paid member (at the
national level) to receive *any* award, from AoA on up.  Membership is not
required, however, to fight in non-Crown tourneys.  Some years back, one had
to submit a device for registration before one would be considered for any
award (it did not have to be passed).  I don't know if this continues.

I understand the necessity for insurance, whether we like it or not.  I am
curious - how is our membership fee being misspent?  Why this distrust of
the BoD?  Dare I say it...?  What the hay.  Enquiring minds want to know.

For this to work, I would want to see a major change in the way heraldic
devices are treated in the SCA. I've had a AoA for better than six years
and have not registered a device. In particular, my persona is 9th centry
norse and anything that I suggest that would reflect period artwork for
my persona seems to give the heralds the screaming willies, and honest
attempts at compromise are treated as me "finally" starting to come around
to a proper device. From my understanding of the matter, the heralds regulate
heraldry, not artwork, and as several heralds have said that what is early
norse artwork is not applicable to heraldry, what I choose to display is
artwork, not hearldry, and is not subject to regulation by the heralds.
Hence, I do not intend to register a device.

As far as paying membership fees goes, after the rated took the big jump
('82 or so) I've only been a paid member when I've been a shire officer.
If that means that my AoA has dissappeared, so be it. Like Marian Greenleaf
in a previous article, I too question the use of funds and the necessity of
the national; in particular, I don't see that I am getting anything approach-
ing my membership's value from the national. If membership becomes an absolute
necessity at its current rate, I will probably look for another hobby that is
more cost effective.

>> require a fee to register the arms that are being awarded.
> This is a misinterpretation, my lord.

I beg to differ. The fact that the $6 fee barely covers costs does not make it
any less of a fee. The rights and priviledges of an AOA is the right display
arms which must be registered.

Your arguement would have been better if you had pointed out that the
college of heralds eats the cost of registering the device for a patent of
arms.

I am not in favour of limiting awards to members and I feel that the whole
issue of membership is unreasonable. I can see the logic behind some parts of
the requirements but not all.
	1. We need an official publication. I don't see that we need TI and
	   I don't see that we need to restrict them to members. The
	   society wide messages could be fed to the kingdom chroniclers for 
	   inclusion in the next kingdom newsletter. On the other hand TI
	   could be restricted to members and the kingdom newsletters not.

	   As an aside, is there anything to prevent the kingdom chroniclers
	   from accepting subscriptions and adding local labels to the set
	   from the registry?

	2. Anyone who sets SCA policy and acts in the name of the SCA needs
	   to a member so that the BoD can hold them legally responsible.
	   Given that royalty can set Kingdom Law, royalty needs
	   membership. Beyond that seneschals and kingdom chroniclers need
	   to members. I don't agree with the disclaimers required of local
	   newsletters but without them, local chroniclers would need to be
	   members. The logic behind exchequers is probably similarly valid.

	3. I can see a similar line of logic that should require that every
	   autocrat be a member.

The only other need for members is to allow the bean (er, make that head)
counting that determines eligibilty of a group to be a shire, barony,
principality or kingdom.

I think that William de Corbie has some good points about paid
membership.  However, his argument assumes that money paid to the
national organization is spent wisely.  Being (at this point) a typical
Easterner myself, I feel compelled (yes, that is the word) to point out
that not everyone feels the national organization is a Good Thing, or a
Necessary Thing.  Please note that I am not saying how I feel about it
by pointing this out; I'm just saying that there's another point of
view to be considered, and that you don't have to be kooky to look at it
from that point of view.

Now I will address the issue from my personal point of view:
How I do feel about it:  I am ambivalent.  I pay my money because I need
access to the newsletters.  I don't begrudge the liability insurance,
except in the general sense that I disapprove of the nation as a whole
being so liability-prone.  To the extent that the SCA Inc. does more
than: 1) provide these two services  2) regulate heraldic expression, and
3) provide for across-the-board recognition of certain awards, I do
sincerely question its legitimacy.  In fact, I would not feel right about
supporting its right to exist unless I had first questioned it.  In my
case, the questioning is ongoing (and, in default of anything that I
think would work better, so is the support. ;-)

(For some reason (as-yet unanalyzed) I find the notion of requiring
those who receive awards to be paid members particulary repugnant.)

>From my point of view, the heart of the organization lies not at the
national (or international) level, but in the individual groups.  I
suspect this is very Eastern of me. ;-)

To Sven Eriksen:

There are a number of groups in the LA/Pasadena area.  Perhaps your best
bet is to contact the Seneschal of Caid:  Vicountess Caitriona ni Bhriain,
MKA Mary K. Buike, 6700 Warner Ave., #23D, Huntington Beach, CA, 92647,
(714-842-1538).

To Elizabeth Braidwood:  The Monteray group is the Barony of Darkwood,
seneschal Wilhelm vom Vweikopfeigen, MKA C. William Klipstine, PO Box 126,
San Martin CA 95046, (408-683-4379).

For anyone interested, my lord husband Lord Friedrich Tomasson av Knusslig
Hamn is the Deputy to the Steward of the Society in charge of the Regnum.
He keeps a database of all groups in the SCA, their location, founding
date, and seneschal's name, address, and phone number.  We print a
quarterly listing by Kingdom and by Mundane location (State, Country, etc.)
for Mistress Hilary and the BoD.  All Kingdom seneschals are *supposed* (we
usually hear from about a third to a half of the seneschals in any given
quarter)  to keep us up-to-date on changes in their Kingdoms and they also
receive a copy of the full regnum.  We also do a count of the number of
groups in any given catagory (for example Shires, Cantons, etc.) per
Kingdom.  As of the last printing (October 1, 1988) there are approx. 548
official and incipient groups in the SCA.  If anyone is interested in other
information, feel free to contact me at the above address.

I agree. I think it implies "Pay us, and we'll give you an award."
If someone deserves an award, they should get it. Period.

"Meandering Rivers" was the first name they were going under, but
since (a) it is a very inauthentic placename, and (b) it wouldn't pass
if submitted, since it conflicts with the River Meander (I don't write
the rules, I just enforces them), they chose a new name.  The new name
has been submitted.

I'm not sure that we are not already requireing that to some extent. If you
consider an AOA the minimum award that requires membership, we require a fee
to register the arms that are being awarded.

In many ways I would rather insist that new members register a device than 
insist that they pay the membership fee. I am not totally convinced that this
is the right approach either. Maybe I should try persuading people to not
send in a membership fee until they have submitted a device.

With regard to the insurance part of the membership fee, here is an
alternative suggestion.

Perhaps the insurance fee should paid by a levy on the groups, proportional
to the number of official events sponsored in the previous year. That is, the
insurance policy is a service required by the groups that hold events,
therefore it should be paid for by the events not the membership.

I am not convinced one way or the other and I would like to see more opinions.

This is a misinterpretation, my lord.  The College of Arms charges a
$6.00 (or so) fee to register a name and device.  This fee barely
covers paperwork.  There is NO requirement that anyone ever register
arms, except for certain requirements established by Kingdom law in some
Kingdoms.  You DO NOT have to register name or arms in order to
receive an award of arms.  In some Kingdoms, you will not receive an
AoA scroll unless you register your name & arms, but that does not bar
you from receiving the award from the King, with all the rank and
priveleges that come with it. 

The idea that only paid members may receive awards is entirely
unworkable in the SCA as it stands, though it has certain logic.  I
personally do not want to see any extension of the requirements for
membership.  Indeed, I would prefer to see most of them eliminated.
For example, can anyone explain just why it is so important for
Royalty and officers to be members?  In particular, can anyone justify
the three Crown Tourney's that needed to be re-fought last year?  I
share Lady Marion's deep distrust of the BoD, who so often have shown
themselves utterly without common sense in the spending of our money.

Message-Id: <8810071615.AA27762@bunker.Bunker>
Subject: Here's a good new armor book

I've found a good new armor book, and wanted to let other metal heads
know about it.  The book is _Arms and Armor of the Medieval Knight_, by
Stephen Turnbull and some other fellow. I know there are two authors,
but the Publishers Central Bureau catalog doesn't list the second, and
my copy is at home. It is a chronological history of European armor
from about the tenth century to about the seventeenth.  The text is
reasonable, but the really good part is the pictures. This book has a
lot of pictures of things you don't usually see in armor books,
especially of earlier (pre-15th century) stuff.

Maestro Roberto di Milano (also known as Master Robert de la Mante)
has told me that he would add this book to his list of "must haves" for
any serious armorer. (To see the rest of the list, and bibliographies
for many other arts and sciences, prepared by recognized Eastern
Authorities in their fields, get a copy of the East Kingdom Arts
Bibliography. Contact the EK Arts office for details.)

And how to get this book? Well, for starters, look on the remainder
tables at all your local bookstores. I've seen copies at several
college campus stores and the Metropolitan Museum of New York as well.
Also, you can order it from the afore-mentioned Publishers Central
Bureau. The book is stock number 644681, Arms and Armor of the Medieval
Knight. The price is $12.98. Shipping and handling is $3.95. NY and NJ
residents add sales tax on the book.  Apparently they take Mastercard,
Visa, American Express, and Optima.

Send it to:	Publishers Central Bureau
		One Champion Ave. / Dept. 250
		P.O. Box 1072
		Newark NJ 07101-1072

I have no financial interest in this book or Publishers Central Bureau. I just
wanted to give as many sources for the book as possible.

Subject: SCA membership policy
Message-ID: <881006013033.18.CONS.ELF@AIDA.UU.SE>

My humble opinions on the proposal to make a paid membership
compulsory for participation in certain activities, notably
fighting in tournaments:

It is important that the SCA continues to be a very open society.
We should not make membership compulsory for attending events,
because this will deter prospective new members. Let the folks in!

On the other hand, I believe that it is only fair that everybody
helps to pay for the costs of the group they are active in. It's
not right to use the SCA as a place where you go and have fun
if you aren't prepared to help finance it.

Thus, I can't see why we should not demand membership from those
who are doing things that people will only be doing if they are
more than newbies or casual visitors. For instance, fighting in
official tournaments, receiving awards and orders, entering arts
and sciences competitions.

I don't believe that this would have a negative effect on member-
ship recruitment. Newbies and Somebies would still be welcome to
attend our activities and actively take part in most of what we
do. But demanding membership for such participation would draw
people's attention to the fact that it costs a lot to run the SCA,
and that they are morally obliged to pay if they want to get
seriously involved.

At present, it is often difficult to get all those people who
are active in a group to pay. Since the group needs a certain
number of paying members in order to be official, a little more
pressure wouldn't hurt. It might help us convince some people
that they should really join the SCA.

Finally, I don't believe that costs rise proportionally to the
number of members. If more people pay, everybody needs to con-
tribute less.

Hi there. I have managed to lose track of a friend of mine who, as of 
last January, was living in Klamath Falls, Oregon. She is fringe-SCA,
so I am hoping that there is someone on teh net who will know who I am
talking about.

Her mundane name is Diane Wells. She did some juggling, was mundanely a
teacher of some sort, (probably Spanish, tho I dont know what level)
and for at least a year was living with a fighter-type whose mundane
name was Paul (I dont know what the last name was). She had been active
for about a year, and had drifted away from going to events regularly
if at all. 

I talked to her last New Year's Eve, and she at that time gave me no 
indications of moving. I have since lost the piece of paper with her 
address and phone number. Telephone info gives me no one named Wells
living at the last known address that I have for her, and the one Wells
they admit to is not my friend. 

If you know her, tell her that Anne Marie is getting married, and she
should call me at (201)769-1558, if only to give me her new address and
phone number on my answering machine. 

I just hope she hasnt left the country, something she always spoke fo 
doing...

I don't know Ms. Howell's sources, but it is certainly true that modern
dance scholors wonder about Arbeau's descripton of the basse dance.
In the editor's notes to the Dover edition of Orchesography, Julia
Sutton writes (p. 215 in the paperback editon which most people have),
"The difficulty of deciphering this step led Mabel Dolmetsch to suggest
that Arbeau had never seen a basse dance (Dances of England and France,
1450-1600, London, 1949, p. 14).  If he did see one, it must have been
when he was very young, and the memory of a septuagenarian may be hazy."

I'm not sure, however, that I would invalidate all of Arbeau because
of this.  Basse dances passed out of vouge (at least as dances, though
they held on as instrumental pieces) in the first half of the 16th
century, well before Arbeau wrote his book.  If we are willing to
assume that the other dances in his book were popular later in the
century (as we know many of them to have been), I would be happy to
use him.

As far as pavans go, it is true that Arbeau links basse dances and
pavans in his book, but I am not sure that that is any reason
to suspect pavans.  There are other sources later than Arbeau which
describe pavans, so they were being done during the time he was
writting.  For that matter, there have been "successful" reconstructions
of Arbeau's basse dance, and Dolmetsch's opinion is no longer considered
very highly, so I see no certain reason to toss even the basse dance
description.  Certainly if one uses other sources (such as Arena, the
Brussels Manuscript and the 15th century italian sources) to reconstruct
the steps, and just take the patterns from Arbeau, the basse dances he
gives could be done.  If there is anything interesting on this in the
notes that you mention, Sir Alan, I'ld love to see it. Has anyone else
got any evidence or information?

Now, will this war pit Romani against Punici, or koini-speaking Romaioi

----------

	In the same Digest, Justin du Coeur commented:
 
;(Side question: has anyone seen any particularly interesting commentary

;seem to have trouble with it; I hear, "That's not right!", rather often,
;usually about a matter upon which the period sources are silent. My gut

;evidence for that.)

Similar attitudes can be found among mundane dancers of various genres
of dance (not that you'd want to LOOK for it, mind you!).  I've gotten
the impression that it may be most common among dancers of an intermediate
level, in particular those of us who have spent much effort in conforming
precisely to the descriptions of each figure, in keeping precise time to
the music, and all that.  If one has the idea that it is important to
perform each figure precisely in accordance to *the* specified description,
handed down from our venerable primary sources, it may be hard to keep room
in one's mind for the contrasting idea that there may have been differences
in some details of, say, the pavan as commonly danced in Burgundy, in
Provence, in Anjou.  (I'm assuming, for the moment, that one could find
the pavan danced in all those places at the same time;  I lack time to
(dis)prove it.)

I used the words "conform" and "perform" in the previous paragraph
deliberately.  At the risk of making obvious the mailing-lists I'm on,
there is a subtle, but very important difference between "moving rhythmically
to music", and dancing with enjoyment.  I wouldn't expect the person who
is 'performing figures to the music' to enjoy the music and the company of
the partner as easily as the dancer who pays attention to all three, and
in an ordinate fashion.  (<-- Weasel word alert!)

I'll grant that there exists on tape a fair amount of "boiler-plate" music;
I've been spoiled by dancing with mundane groups who always have live music,
by musicians who (for the most part, at least) seem to pay some attention to
the dancers.  But even the mediocre "preserved jongleurs" are more interesting
than a metronome, and they should have some effect on the dance.

As a case in point, Justin has a tape with two variants of "La Spagna", which
sees much service in Carolingia for the popular ballo chiamata "Lauro".  The
two versions sound (to me, at least) as if they embody different attitudes
towards the dance, and towards how one perceives and presents oneself, and
for my part, I cannot dance in precisely the same way to both pieces.

My attitude these days is that when one is dancing socially, and one makes
a mistake, if it didn't break the set or one's partner ;-) it's usually not
worth a lot of worry.  I'd like to think that I'm more pleasant to dance with
now than some years ago, when I took most things too seriously.

Subject: Membership requirements

 Unto the good gentles of the Society, reachable through this
 arcane domain, come greetings from the Society Chronicler.
 
 I'd like to remind folks that the deadline for submitting your
 comments on membership requirements to the Board is Oct. 7. This
 deadline is real -- they mean received by Oct. 7, not postmarked
 by Oct. 7. This issue is complex and central to many of our
 activities, and I'd personally like to see the Board get as much
 input from as many different viewpoints as possible.
 
 I'll be attending the Board meeting in Vancouver (god willing and
 United still flying!) on October 22, and I'd be happy to take
 input, private or public, for the discussion of this issue.
 Please remember, however, that the best way to get your point of
 view before the Board is to write, and before Oct. 7.
 
 I remain, in service to our Society,
 
    Siobhan Medhbh O'Roarke
    Society Chronicler

Greetings!

A few months ago, when this newsgroup was jsut starting up, I posted
notes to five or six other newsgroups on which I had encountered SCA
folk, telling them about the mailing list.  Since then, every month or
so, I have gotten back a response from those postings.  Today I got
one from a SCAdian in Finland.  I think he is the first.

To the best of my knowledge, the SCA now includes members in:

* USA
* Canada
  Mexico
  Korea
  Japan
  Philipines
* Australia
* New Zealand
  United Kingdoms
  W. Germany
* Netherlands
  Italy
  Spain
* Sweden
* Finland

The starred countries indicate native SCA populations, as opposed to
Americans abroad.  I would welcome any corrections to this list.

Ciao.

Gentles, 
  I am looking for information on the Dark Horde.  I'm a newly authorized 
fighter.   


          Thank you in advance.

Subject: Results of the Sixth Crown Tournament of the Outlands
Message-Id: <791@ncar.ucar.edu>


	The Sixth Crown Tournament of the Outlands was held Saturday,
October 1, in the Barony of Caerthe (mundanely, Denver, Colorado).
There were 20 entrants to the list, including two former kings of
the Outlands, Count Artan Skulcrusher and Count Johann von Balduinseck.
They had come to seek the honor of becoming the first Outlandish
Duke (first fighter to become king of the Outlands twice).  Interestingly
enough, though the lists were very well balanced and there were other
extremely good fighters competing, the two of them met in the
final round!  At this time, Artan and his lady Tara are now the
Crown Prince and Crown Princess of the Outlands.  They will be crowned
the first week in November.  Some of you out there have probably
met their Highnesses since they attending Pennsic last year, the
first King and Queen of the Outlands to do so.

Long live the King!  
	Long live the Queen!  
		Long live the Crown Prince!
			Long live the Crown Princess!
Long live the Kingdom of the Outlands!

Mistress Demelza Felinnoir

From article <8077@cit-vax.Caltech.Edu>, by joe@cit-vax.Caltech.Edu (Joe Beckenbach):

  A minor correction here. The Dolphin is not an arts award, but a service
 award.  There are two arts awards: the Harp Argent -An award for skill in an
given art form,  and a Laurel  - An award for skill, teaching, and for
improving the art form.  A Laurel also raises the person to a peerage(Master/
Mistress ).

   The Dolphin is at the same level as the Harp Argent but for service to 
the crown.  A Pelican is at the same level as a Laurel but for service.


                                Long Live Caid
