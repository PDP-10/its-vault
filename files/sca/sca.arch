Subject: Hamlet debates

Hamlet debates! Oh goody! afavorite sport from my high school days.

The question of how much time passes during the course of the play is a good
one.  Personally, I think it to be rther shorter than five years.  My sense of
the passing of time is that it is about one year or less.  Granted, alot
happens inthat year, but none of it impossible.    The Fortinbras afair is
quite immediate and rapid.  Act one, Scene Two has Claudius discussing
Frotinbras demand for the return of lands lost by his father.  At various
points through the play we are lead to believe that Fortinbras is a man of
action who wastes little time with words, and so the whole affair of demand to
invasion is not going to be any five years, but a matter of months, which is my
chief reason for believing that the events of Hamlet take place in less than a
year.  

Other things that take up time are Hamlet's moping about doing nothing, and his
various encounters with Claudius and Polonius.  Intrigues of this sort tend to
move fairly rapidly as well.  One thing that people quote as taking up a long
time is Hamlet's voyage to England.  The trip from Denmark to England is very
whort.  In fair weather about twenty four hours, in poor weather up to a week.
This does not consume a significant amount of time.  Especially when you
consider that he didn't go to England, he got offshore of Denmark, and then
transferred tot he pirate vessel that landed him back almost immediately.  

And the grave diggers do identify Hamlet as being thirty years old.  It is not
impossible of even inconceivable for a university student to be thirty years
old then or now.  University was expensive and time consumiong, even moreso
then thatn now.  It would be reasonable for students to enter a t a later age
in order to have more time to accumulate funds.  And it would not be unusual
for students to string out their education over a number of years, either
through lack of time, or lack of cash.  

To me Hamlet is not the story of how a callow youth matures into a man, but how
a man, overcome by misfortune, struggles to regain his old personality, verve,
and confidence.

The idea that Claudius is really a good guy is a new one on me.  I have  a hard
time accepting a guy who commits premeditated murder as a hero.  And Poison in
the ear!  Also, he was coronated barely a month after old Hamlet's death, a
married Getrude about two months after Hamlet's death.  This is, in Hamlet's
words, "unseemly haste".  And yes, theire was an election, but if a man can
carefully premeditate a murder, I'm sure he'll not neglect the little detail of
buying the election necessary for him to enjoy the fruits of his crime.
Claudius has other endearing little traits, sucha s spying on his nephew,
conniving with the politicians (wonder if Polonius was an Elector?), setting up
Hamlet's friends as his watchdogs, and then sending his nephew off to be
murdered by the English.  

But the interpretation I really disagree with is Coleridge's.  he had the gall
to rewrite Hamlet and, in his own words "Save it from all that rubbish of the
fifth act."I happen to like Hamlet just as it is, and a Hamlet in which King
Hamlet and Queen Ophelia live happily ever after is a little hard for me to
take.
Yours in Service to the happy sport of Shakespeare debating,

Subject: Arts competitions

      Maybe someone out there has had a bad experience with arts competitions,
and Ice Dragon in particular, but I didn't.  Arts competitions, as far as my
rather limited experience goes, have always been a hell of a lot of fun.
  
      People who spend all their time complaining that they haven't gotten
this award or that award out of a major arts competition should spend less
time complaining and more time looking at the winning entries and improving
their art.  I've never gotten first place in a major competition, either,
but I never disagreed that the pieces placed ahead of mine were not superior
for one reason or another.  This may be an unpopular statement, but most
people (MOST, mind you, not all) who spend their time complaining that they
didn't get 'X' award weren't the ones who deserved it the most anyway.  Half
the fun of entering your stuff in an arts competition is to see how it
stands up to the others, talking to people, etc.  Getting the awards is a
nice pat on the back, but it's certainly not the only reason I  enter
competitions.  You can be one of the ones who doesn't get first prize and
still get recognition for your work.  (Disclaimer:  I am not talking about
Kingdom awards here.  I am talking about arts competitions.  There are
people in remote and distant groups who might not get the recognition of
other, larger groups.)
  
     Personally, I got a lot of very nice and extremely helpful commentary
from an illumination piece I had at Ice Dragon two years ago . . . including
one gem from Mistress Marian Greenleaf that revolutionized the way I used
red paint (it's trickier than it sounds).  
  
     As for discouraging 'starters', that Ice Dragon was my first entry as
an unknown, and I came in third out of twenty -- ahead of a couple of
laurels, I should add.  I did not feel discouraged at all.  Perhaps things
have changed, but I never had bad feelings about the arts competitions.
It might not be completely reflective of medieval life, but we don't have
castles to display the arts in, either.  In fact, I think arts competitions
are a good way to encourage the arts -- if nothing else, but to see what the
'state-of-the-art' is in your particular field of interest.

Subject: Arts Competitions

Lady Nicolette Bonhomme raises several points about arts competitions
and feels that her opinion may be unpopular. If it is, my lady, I'll
be unpopular right with you. I do not think Arts Competitions are worth
the bother of entering. The idea is to win - the prizes are not usually
exciting enough to inspire entries, so the winning seems to be the primary
motivation. Yuk. If I want to show off my work, I'll organize a display.

To touch upon some of the points Lady Nicolette raised:

Arts Comps are culprits for dissatisfaction -- Yes. I don't see why 
arts comp. entries do enough for the Kingdom to warrant getting an award 
after entering several contests, anyway. The only thing I can think of is
the contest may be the only avenue of having your work seen. There are 
better ways.

Arts Comps are not vehicles for helpful commentary -- certainly not, esp.
when the judges are trying to justify to you why the other person won. 
Workshops are a much better forum for really helpful comments.

Arts Comps burn people out -- Indeed. Winning a contest is not enough
to make staying up till 4 AM worth while. The straw that broke my patience
with contests was Last Crown Tourney. I had stayed up till midnight cooking 
Lamb and onion stew. I had copies of the original and adapted recipies. 
I had terrible smelling hands. I had three gallons of stew. And, I was in
the lists that day. I don't wear a watch while in garb, and the heralds 
did not announce the start of the contest, at 2:00. Good Heavens, the second round just ended, how can it be 2:00 already? Well, I didn't remember the time until almost four. Four is the "scheduled herald time" when they will come round 
holler important things at you. They did announce the start of the embroidery co
contest. Well, the folks with digital watches under their tunics won the
cooking contest, and I was left with huge amounts of stew. No More.

Arts Comps are discouraging to newer artisans - Especially when the Embroidery Laurel keeps entering the embroidery contests  and the costuming Laurel keeps
entering the costuming contests. 

In the interest of not flaming contests without suggesting a better
alternative, I will say that last summer the West held an entire weekend event
geared to the arts and sciences. We held classes, workshops, lectures, and
seminars on everything from herbalism to period pavilions. This was a 
great chance to talk with people about their projects. I made a silk veil for the occasion, taught a duchess how to wear a wimple, talked about tourney
furniture with a gentleman whose pavilion sported a new set, watched the 
Queen play croquet (some great Alice-in-Wonderland jokes), watched Sir 
Steven of Norham create the most outrageous german elbow cop I have ever
seen (He'll be wearing it at Estrella), danced in the fields, stared at
the stars and heard some really great war stories at Christian's campfire.
I had an immense amount of fun and a relaxing weekend. This year, of course,
I'll hold a scroll display :-)

Subject: Re: What Think You?

M'Lady,

At a recent Trimarian event, I heard several complaints regarding Art/Sci
competitions, most of them being ones that you have mentioned.  Some additional
gripes are:

Since our kingdom gives special notice to the gentles who receive the highest
scores, there are complaints that this encourages some folks to enter large
amounts of average work.  These folks could then quite easily receive notice
in court for the sheer amount of their work, not the quality.  (We do give
honor to those gentles with the highest score for one piece of work, however)

Those who enter items of armor and such have had points taken off for dents
and scratches and such.  They made their entry for use and do not like to have
to let it sit collecting dust just so it looks pretty for entry in competition
months after it was made.

An item entered in Art/Sci must be made six months before the competition.  I
know for fact that many things (embroidery for instance) can take longer that
(up to 2 years in some cases, but it was one of the most beautiful pieces I
have ever seen in my life!).

Lastly, the biggest gripe I have heard is regarding documentation.  Most agree
that documentation is necessary, but do not feel that taking off large amounts
of points for lack of "proper" documentation is necessary.  A few points is
warranted, but not in the quantities that I have been hearing about.


My own personal problem is that of the third gripe.  I start projects, work
on them for a while, put them aside, and pick them up again.  I never get
anything done in 6 months.

Trimarian Art/Sci is this weekend.  This year I will definitely listen more
closely and note what other complaints or helpful suggestions are out there.

In Service,
Heather

Great from a personal point of view, because there's so little
hard evidence.  :-)

Now that I think about it, one or two years is more reasonable
than five, but I was originally thinking in terms of the changes
in Hamlet's personality.  In my favorite production (RSC Stratford
last April) They had Hamlet going through his procrastination period 
dressed in pyjamas (white w/grey strips) his socks slipping off his feet, 
looking like a cross between an all-nighter, a kid in Dr. Dentons,
and a convict.  After he returns from England, he was dressed in
a sailor outfit.  *Very* different.  And I have to admit, I saw
the Ryland interview, where he said it was ten years.  But then who 
said Hamlet had to mature like an average person?  :-)  Ok.  I'll 
downgrade to three years.  :-) (after all, that's what Hamlet *says*)
[And before you know we'll have a deal at 1.75 years :-]

Ok.  My defense.  Fortinbras, as you say, is the man of action,
(usually pointed out, with Laertes, by professors as the perfect
contrast/parallels to Hamlet-the-passive.   Same situation: father
dead, kingdom to claim, people to kill, etc.)  He strikes me as a
bullheaded character.   Not easily inclined to change his
determined way.  Yet by the scene where Claudius is discussing Fortinbras
(somewhere in act IV, I think, after Polonius is stabbed and
Hamlet sent off), he's changed his mind, and is asking for safe 
passage through Denmark to go and attack a little plot of land in 
Poland nobody the hell wants, but a couple thousand people are gonna 
get killed over, anyways.

I think that convincing Fortinbras, a commander so bullheaded and
dogged about getting his soldiers killed, must've taken a lot of
dead people and hardship to leave off harassing Denmark--especially since he
can claim a lot of it through birthright, and it's only his
father's stupid oneupsmanship that lost it in the first place.
(dueling for a piece of land! Sheesh!  :-)
 
>Other things that take up time are Hamlet's moping about doing nothing, and his

This, I think, is relatively compacted action.  Not a lot of
time.

True.  It's not a long distance.  But who knows how long the
battle took, how long he was held hostage, how many days were
spent negotiating....  (ok, I'm reaching :-)

>And the grave diggers do identify Hamlet as being thirty years old.  

No "they" don't.  Only the First Gravedigger.  <pick-a-nit>.

Yes.  I've met quite a few...  :-)

Well, it's a different story for every person.  (Obviously.
That's why they make you read it in high school.)  I personally
see it as a study of action and contemplation.  Neither one's
wholly good or bad "but thinking makes it so."  :-)
 
>The idea that Claudius is really a good guy is a new one on me.  

Good.  (everybody remembers this is my pet theory, and that I'm
biased in favor of it and not necessarily to believe everything I
say?  Good. :)

>I have a hard
>time accepting a guy who commits premeditated murder as a hero.  

So, then, you don't think of Hamlet, or Laertes as heroic, either.

>And Poison in the ear!  

Shakespearean thing.  He likes the metaphor.  Uses it to death in
OTHELLO.

>Also, he was coronated barely a month after old Hamlet's death, a
>married Getrude about two months after Hamlet's death.  

Ophelia says "twice two months."  It's Hamlet who says two, and
he's highly subjective.  Whose word do we take?

>This is, in Hamlet's words, "unseemly haste".  

Sure, but there's also the wholehearted backing of the entire
court.  (oops.  Re-using a point made before.  There's gotta be
a rule against that. :)   What about Hamlet's jesting reason
of "Thrift, Horiatio, thrift" ?  :-6

>And yes, theire was an election, but if a man can
>carefully premeditate a murder, I'm sure he'll not neglect the little detail of
>buying the election necessary for him to enjoy the fruits of his crime.

Yeah, but to buy off *everybody*--when there's a rightful heir of
more-than-age who's dearly loved by the people?  Wouldn't they be
a little scared of riots and such?  And Gertrude *loves* Claudius.
Besides, wouldn't he think about the kids he might have with
Gertrude and about the danger he puts himself in of being
dethroned when he names Hamlet as his heir?  And yet, he still
does it.  Is it worth the PR to set up your dangerous nephew as
heir, and to urge him to be nearby, when he's quite content to
just sink back into the woodwork and leave the country to go back
to university?

Claudius is also obviously a good king.  The only problems he's having
are with Fortinbras.  He's not waging war against someone.  
(Why are all the "heroic" kings the ones who go out and get their
soldiers killed?)

>Claudius has other endearing little traits, sucha s spying on his nephew,

Sure, he spies, but it's because Hamlet's acting so weird.  It's
done mostly out of concern for Gertrude, and at Polonius'
instigation.  For Hamlet's own good.  And Claudius is smart enough to 
figure out that Hamlet's upset about him, not over love for Ophelia.  
"Love? His feelings do not that way tend."  And at least he spies in
his own person.  :-)

You wanna talk about spying, what about Polonius's scheme with
Reynaldo to watch over Laertes in Paris?  Now *that*'s spying!!  Also
slandering.  

>conniving with the politicians (wonder if Polonius was an Elector?), 

Your interpretation.  :-)

>setting up Hamlet's friends as his watchdogs, 

I've always seen this as more the fault of Rosencranz and
Guildenstern.  I mean, Horatio wasn't such a twit as to go help
Claudius kill Hamlet.  :-)  [and for anyone who *still* hasn't
read Stoppard's ROSENCRANZ AND GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD, this is a
plug.  Go find it and read it.  It's great.  The movie version is
supposed to be filming (finally!--it's been over twenty years).  
Roger Rees as Guildenstern.  Oh, boy!]

>and then sending his nephew off to be
>murdered by the English.  

Well, please to remember that this is *after* Hamlet's killed
Polonius.  Hamlet is a murderer at this point.  He should, by
rights, have been executed.  In a particular speech, Claudius
says that he's worried about the safety of everybody at court
(and most particularly Gertrude's.)  You can take this to be
a two-faced attempt at rationalization, or at face value.
Obviously, I prefer the latter.  I mean, sure, he's worried about
his own life, but does that completely cancel out the fact that
he's also worried over Gertrude's and Ophelia's?   And how would
you feel about some maniac stabbing your best friend to death 
and going 'oops!  Wrong guy' (not a direct quote :-), and then
"lugging the guts" out and stuffing him into a hole over the 
dining room?  Wouldn't you think there was something the
teensiest bit wrong with him?  Especially if he starts babbling
on about "spunges"?

Almost as bad as the legendary Colly Cibber (?) rewriting of 
Lear, where everybody lives happily ever after and Cordelia marries 
Edgar. (I suppose she silently divorced the King of France. :-)

But on the other hand, I heartily approve of Shaw's rewritten
ending to CYMBELINE.  Works *much* better for me.  (Never could
see how Imogen still liked Posthumus after he doubted her 
faithfulness, tried to get her murdered, and then hit her in 
front of EVERYONE...<sigh>)

I have been extremely reluctant to enter any level of A&S compitition due to the fact that I really have no contact with others in my area (knitting), and due to the fact that I really can not get anyone interested in attending a compitition.  The only ones I ever hear about are the Kingdom level, and I figure by that time it is too late to enter anything.
I think the idea of an exhibition of works is wonderful, and I hope that some one in the Middle Kingdom will do this really soon.  I would love feedback on my work, and some advice on documentation (which I really hate to do).
On the subject of smocking....Lady Aelfhalen Dracsidth (or Aelfhalen of the Two Willows, as she is also know) made a wonderful smocked blaiut. The bodice and the top third of the sleeves were smocked.  Unfortunately, it took her about 10
years from the time she bought the material to the time she finally finished it.She had seen some pictures of what she thought looked like smocking, and decided that it was smocking, so she started.  I have seen this dress on three different people (Aelfhalen, Baroness Takia Merlone of Rivenstar, and Countess Katherineof Sternfeld).  None of these women are even close in size, however, since the 
bodice is smocked, it stretches to fit, or contracts, and looks really good.

Well, that is my two shillings worth, hope I didn't bore anyone too much.

    Lady Nicolette:
   Glad you had the inspiration to air your views on the subject of arts
 competitions.   I've entered Ice Dragon a few times, and have had some
very nasty comments on my "Judge's Comment Sheet."  (Some that would
surprise you, I think, just by their viciousness.)  Anyway, I've thought about
writing to the people in charge of the Pent this year and asking that only
POSITIVE criticism be given on the comment sheet.  There's a big difference
between saying what needs to be done to improve documentation or method,
and saying that the entire attempt is wrong and shouldn't
have been entered in the first place.
   But I don't think that it is the Arts Competitions which create the bad
feelings, I think it is the way in which they are handled by the judges and the
people in charge.  Ice Dragon is too big, and drains the competitors in their
hectic rush before hand to get 5 things (or more) done.  Smaller, "friendly"
competitions may be the answer.  They would encourage people to do the research
for authenticity (if such is important to them) and to hone their skills.  If
recognition is truly needed, the competitions could be treated like the archery
shoots - winner's, runners-up, etc. names could be sent in to the kingdom and

Subject: Alternatives to Arts Contests

Alternatives to Arts Contests: I

There are a variety of ways of encouraging the arts that may achieve
what arts contests are intended to achieve, without the considerable
problems that have been noted by a number of posters. The following
is one that I have been doing for some years.

As some of you know, each Pennsic there is an in-persona bardic
circle at my encampment every evening for about a week. I bring with
me to Pennsic about half a dozen twisted silver Norse arm rings. If a
performance impresses me enough, I give the performer one of the
rings.

This is, in a sense, a contest in the Bardic arts, but one that
avoids, I think all of the problems of arts contests. Unlike the
usual affair of points for this and that, documentation, discussions
of sources, etc., this "contest" is taking place in an entirely
period context--a wealthy lord rewarding entertainers. Furthermore,
the performances are not being done to and for a judge but to
entertain the people sitting around my campfire. People are not
coming to compete for a prize; indeed, many performers probably do
not know about the prize, and for the rest it is at most a secondary
reason for coming. Rather, they are coming to entertain and be
entertained, and I, as the host, occasionally express my appreciation
for those who do a particularly good job of entertaining my guests.

There is no reason why this way of encouraging the arts need be
limited to my particular example; with appropriate variations, it
could be used for many arts. In order to do such a "private arts
contest" one needs three things. You need an artisan willing to make
the gifts, you need a host with enough status and stage presence to
give them out, and you need a judge with enough expertise to
recognize what ought to be rewarded and enough reputation so that
people will regard the prize as deserved. In my case I play all three
roles, but there is no reason why they could not be divided among two
or three different people.

Jewels are one obvious gift, and the one I use. Scrolls are another.
Garments are a third; in medieval Islam, it was traditional to give a
"robe of honor" to someone the lord wanted to reward. There do not
have to be very many gifts; I give out about one a night.

An essential part of this way of encouraging the arts is that it not
be presented as a contest, and hence that any "judging" that is going
on be out of sight. This has some disadvantages. The degree to which
authenticity is rewarded depends on the degree to which I can
recognize it. A performance that is excellent for primarily musical
reasons, although welcome at my fire, is unlikely to receive a gift
from me, since I am not competent to judge it. A formal arts contest,
by using many judges, standard criteria, written documentation, etc.,
may do better. 

On the other hand, my impression is that things in arts contests
often get judged by people who are not competent, simply because
there are not enough experts in enough fields available. In my case I
think it is fairly clear that what gifts are given for are the sorts
of performances that impress me. In effect, I am giving a contest in
what I can judge, someone else is giving one, somewhere else in
another form, in what he can judge, etc.

Suppose you are a well-known dancemaster, with access to a skilled
jeweler, and want to encourage good period dancing. You have some
sort of tokens made up. You bring one to any event at which there
will be dancing, and present it, with appropriate words, to anyone
who greatly impresses you with how well he dances period dances, or
how well he has translated and worked out a period dance. The
generalizations to garb, armoring, musical performances, drama, etc.
are, I think, obvious.

My one experience with Ice Dragon was a positive one.

The BMDL entered a *lot* of musical performances, and that's what I got the
best view of.  Some of the best entries were well worth the enormous amount
of time and effort they took to prepare -- but that time would never have
been freed up on a casual "let's get together regularly for the next two
months and practice this song" basis.

Some of the entries weren't good at all.  In the more benign cases (and there
were a good number of these) the entrants *knew* this, and were just
enjoying themselves.

Besides (and here performance entries differ somewhat from other categories)
the notion of having a large, knowledgeable, and sufficiently *quiet*
audience can be a major incentive to put in the work a good entry can require
-- and sad to say, there aren't too many Scadian forums other than competitions
which offer this.

but it was succeeded Tuesday evening by SCA Digest #276.  No, this wasn't a
blast from the past; the software was buggy and snarfed the wrong
next-issue-number when composing the digest.  This is what we get for being
a test case for the new program.  The hackers here believe the bug has now
been fixed.
    In the mean time, well, that -should- have been issue #575, right?
Therefore, that is hereby -declared- to have been issue #575, and anyone
who feels punctilious about such things is welcome to edit his or her own
copy to say so.  The next issue, the one containing this administrative
note, should return to the consecutive numbering and be issue #576.

I remember seeing a production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" at the Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford, CT, about 9 years ago.  The set itself is best described

played Puck flipping from bar to bar while delivering his lines....
I must say that it was the best production of that play I have seen.

Subject: Drogin's Mediaeval Calligraphy

Greetings, all, from Ariel.

Marc Drogin's book Mediaeval Calligraphy: Its History and Technique has just
hit the bookshelves again, after a long absence.  This time it's been reprinted
by Dover Books.

You can order it by mail if it's not at your friendly local bookstore.  Price
is $10.95, order number 0-486-26142-5.  The publisher is:

Dover Publications, Inc.
31 East 2nd Street
Mineola, NY  11501

Yo Carolingians!  Barilleri Books, the new bookstore in Harvard Square, has a
whole bunch of copies.  They're 10% off, too.

For those of you not familiar with Drogin's book, this is a must-have.  Drogin
discusses the history of mediaeval calligraphy from AD 400 till the end of
the 15th century, "after which that instrument of the Devil, the printing press,
was invented and changed the course of calligraphic history" (quote his).
Drogin also talks about the alphabets, the materials used, the scribes them-
selves, and even the patron demon of calligraphy, Titivullus.  There are lots
of writing samples, actual bits of documents to look at, and (of course) a
heavy dose of Drogin's humour.

Go out and get this book, or get the acquisitions librarian or your local
Guild head to order it.  Trust me -- this is well worth having.

         Several  people  have  contacted  me  via  this  address  with
         greetings; thanks! Unfortunately, I have only  limited  access
         to the net, and don't tend to see the postings more often than

         questions will forgive me for  the  lateness  of  my  answers.
         Anyone wishing to contact me here is welcome  to  do  so,  but
         please understand that a letter or phone call  may  receive  a
         more expeditious reply.

         To Arval and the College of Heralds: It's probably  not  worth
         posting LoC's to me, as I have not had the time to  be  active
         in the College. Thanks for thinking of me, though.

         For those who weren't at East Kingdom  Twelfth  Night  in  the
         Canton of Marwick, it  was  very  interesting.  The  hall,  an
         armoury, was enormous; it could have held 1000 people  easily.
         They had the tables set for dinner, chairs for court, an  area
         for dancing, and merchants all along one wall, all set up  *at
         the same time*. On the second floor balcony there was room for
         the arts exhibit, and there were side rooms for  the  Royalty,
         Children, and whatnot. If it had been heated,  it  would  have
         been really nice. As it was, most people  wore  cloaks.  There
         were also plenty of gentle lords willing  to  help  keep  cold
         ladies warm... Marwick may well have set a record  for  number
         of feasters: the feast autocrat told me there were  67  tables
         of 8, for a total of 536 on-board. The feast was  interesting,
         though perhaps a trifle exotic  for  some  people,  with  duck
         pate, venison  and  chicken  pie,  pickled  beef,  and  mashed
         parsnips. The best dish was probably the roast pork. I  didn't
         watch all of Court, but I know that Their  Majesties  knighted
         Rhys of Harlech, and made Mitchell McBain and Jessa d'Avondale
         (EK Chroniclers Emeritus as  of  that  day)  Court  Baron  and
         Baroness. There was a lot of entertainment during  the  feast,
         including a delightful performance of Arbeau's "Bufons"  by  a
         dance troop from Settmour Swamp. There was also live music for
         the dancing later. I had a very nice time.

You won't get any major arguments from me.  On the other hand--arts *displays*
probably ought to be encouraged.  Not that they're particularly period, but
that they will expand peoples ideas about what is posssible and what is
period.  The problem then becomes--  How do you keep such displays non-
competitive?

On the whole--what I really prefer is to make things for use.  This does
not bar them from being "art"--consider the thrones of the West (if you've
ever seen them or pictures of them).

On a related, topic--my pet bugaboo is that so many people forget that
the Laurel is for Arts *and*Sciences*.  When was the last time you say
someone elevated to the Laurel for *sciences* within the Society's  
meaning of the term?

I made a sunshade/tarp/half-pavilion for the war last year.  It was a
last minute kind of thing, and I ran out and bought a cotton painter's
cloth the day before leaving.  The best one I could find, as fare as 
fabric/weave/thickness/opacity/availability were concerned, was
unfortunately somewhat pink.  By the end of the war it was white.
(And by the time it got home it was grey splotched with black -- it
rained while I was packing).  

As for linen, I was interested to see in an issue of Spinning (or some
such name) in an article on retting your own flax, that it makes a
difference what kind of water you rett in -- dew results in grey,
stagnant pong brownish, and so forth.  One more variable to take into
account.

   In reply to a question from Niccolette Bonhommie (sp?), asking if arts
competitions are not actually (1) not period, (2) discouraging to newcomers in
whatever artistic field, (3) liable to burn out the artists, (4) encourage a
'merit badge' attitude.

   IMHO (terribly humble, I speak only as observer), _large_ competitions DO
tend to burn people out.  The Ice Dragon 'olympic-level' arts competition is
a huge affair, requiring immense effort to win in most catagories.  But I feel
that a large regional competition is a good thing, IN MODERATION.
   At the most recent local 12th Night (Principality of Aethelmark, East
Kingdom) we had and arts and sciences _exhibition_.  Not a competition, no
prizes, no judges.  Work both completed and in progress was shown, with a
system of cards so that named or anonymous comments could be given.  This was
run by Lady Marion Greenleaf (A&S, East Kingdom, I believe) and went over so
well that at the end of the event the exhibits had to be pulled out from under
the noses of the good gentles perusing them.
   I would put in my two cents for more arts and sciences shows of this sort.
It is not competitive, and there are no clearly labeled winners (encouraging
to beginners), and I believe supportive of experimentation.  Feedback is
given, some works are in progress, and such an exhibition, held on the local
scale, would allow more feedback on a greater variety of work.
   People who worked up their confidence with something of this sort, or with
_small_, _local_ competitions, could if they wished show something on the
Ice Dragon level.  But I think there is a need for lower level competitions
and non-threatening exhibitions, so that the learning/documentation/show
curve is not so steep.

   Incidentally, not everyone goes to big arts and sciences competitions.
Exhibitions can be held so that they do not violate 'virginity', allowing
perhaps a work in progress to be criticized while it is being worked on, or
to simply let a larger number of people see what kinds of things can be done!
More exposure at the local level to arts and sciences is A Good Thing (TM).

   Feedback, anyone?

Subject: Another bit of lint for the gathering dust bunny...

Greetings!

I've been looking and thinking about at the figure Greadan posted and was 
asking about, to wit:
        ____________
        \  /\  /\  /
         \/  \/  \/  

I would recommend a blazon of:  "3 piles palewise, couped." My reasons are
several.  Mostly, there's always variation amongst heraldic artists; also, it
isn't really all that unusual for more than one correct blazon to be possible
for a given emblazon-- it happens all the time. 

Thus, trying to blazon this figure as "a chief dancetty" would (IMHO) too 
likely result in something like:

               --------------------------------
               |                              |
               \/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/

In other words, "too toothy", if you will.

I think the blazon I suggest would help assure a narrow interpretation.  Piles 
are, after all, isosceles triangles by definition.  Issuant from chief is the 
default.  "Palewise" ensures the vertical orientation, while "couped" ensures 
that they don't continue across the field.

It is true that any given heraldic artist, in emblazoning this, might not get 
the proportions precisely as Greadan describes them.  But, that's very 
probably going to be the case anyway.

Anyway, that's my bit of lint!  :-)

Gentles, greetings from Arval!

The blazon problem is solved.  The charge I had posted here last week,
which looked like a saltire couped surmounted by a cross couped
smaller, is legit!  Master Erasimiercz Waspanieski's article "Some
Crosses and Their Forms", from the proceedings of the West Kingdom
Heraldic Symposium, shows the Lotharingian Cross, used as a badge by
the nobility of Lorraine in period.  Turned saltirewise, it is
precisely the charge I described.

I'm going to mention another X word, or X sentence, perhaps. 
Why not make scrolls that look period?

Greadan at the end of his message has this to say about being period:
>(I'm not snarking at you, Cher, really - imagine how you would feel if it

I've got the impression that medieval awards of arms scrolls weren't made
too look beautiful. They were legal documents. The calligraphy and
illumination were done by the church for religious texts. 

If I'm correct then scrolls don't have to look good. If calligraphing and
illuminating all scrolls is to much work, and doing it with only some (say
peerage scrolls) is unacceptable for equal rights reasons (wich i don't
agree that it is) then stop doing beautifull award scrolls at all! 

Find another object for calligraphy. Say, a book of the history of a noble,
a reign or an area. Or, best of all, start calligraping the religous texts.

>Scribal sanity ... is based on feeling like the *medieval* skills of

If you'r calligraphy aren't of use but the medieval was, then there must be
something wrong with our recreation.

No, it's not. The quality in an award of arms is in the gentle of receive
it, not inthe way it is given.

Then don't put ypur award up for display. It's not supposed to be
displayed. It's a legal document. You've received it so that you can prove
that your armigerous if there isn't any wirnesses from the court close and

Greetings from William de Corbie!

Knud Kaukinen comments on my glogg recipe, and says he thinks people
use aquavit, not vodka.
If I understand the word correctly, aquavit means "spiced vodka".
This is pretty much what you are doing with the spices in my recipe:
you are turning the vodka into aquavit.
Using something that has already been spiced means you get the taste
of those spices as well, and there are lots of different varieties.
I strongly advice against it.

But I agree that the red wine should not be *too* cheap. And glogg
is probably *not* a period drink, even if spiced wine is. But it's
*good*.
 
I recently made glogg according to my recipe - actually, I'm drinking
a cup as I write this. The taste is just right. This is what we Swedes
mean by glogg. Definitely.

Greetings from Eleanor MacNaughton.

Nicolette - I must agree with your posting on arts competitions.  Anyone
else?

I'd really like to see regular Arts displays
, but I'm not comfortable
with the competitions.  How about fairs?  Did people display their
latest efforts (rather like today's state fairs) at the local fair?
Work-in-progress displays would really be neat, too - I think I could
learn a lot from seeing the in-between stages of work.  That idea could
also elevate the role of the technical aspects of construction.  (I hope
that's clearer than it seems to me right now.)

Not to change the subject, but ... does anyone know of specific references
to smocking in early period?  I have read in many places that garments were
originally smocked for a better fit, and have also read that the term
"smock" for a simple garment was derived from that practice.  However, 
no one ever seems to give specific dates.  I'm probably just missing a
major reference, but I've been looking this up - and it's really bugging
me.  (If you hadn't guessed, yes, I smock - mundanely.  And I'd like to
be able to bring that skill into my persona.)

Hope someone can help.  (Niccola, maybe?  sp?)

If they don't stain then they won't dye well :-)

The only one I really remember is onion skins which gives a yellow-tan,
I suppose beets and carrots ought to work if you grind them up.

You may have to dye them several times to get the color you want.
Dye it, let it dry, dye it again.

Salt is sometimes used to set the dye.  The first washing is in
cold salt water.

Subject: Scrolls - REply to Lindorm

Greetings again from William de Corbie.

Lord Lindorm Eriksson is quite correct that the medieval documents
which most closely correspond to our scrolls were usually not at all
as illuminated or beautifully written as SCA documents are. They 
were legal documents, grants of titles and lands and arms, etcetera.
The writing was often beautiful, but not always.
 
SCA scrolls are an example of CREATIVE anachronism. We have taken the
illuminations and caligraphy from religious books and applied them to
our legal documents. The combination is truly period in style and
intent, even if nothing quite like it existed in the Middle Ages.

As to the problem with seals that won't fit into frames, the solution
is simple. Seals should not be affixed directly on the surface of the
scroll. They should be suspended in a string or ribbon from the bottom
of the page. You can then frame the scroll and let the seal hang down
outside the frame. Framing may not be period, but seals were fastened
to documents in this way.

Subject: Regional variation in scribes, Western backlog

Greetings to the Rialto from Sarra Graeham (courtesy of Lord Angus):

I have been reading Rialtos in a huge lump, so I've lost names; forgive me.
I believe it was Cait who commented that she did Randal's Ducal and Kathe-
rine's County scrolls, and lavished time on them.  I still stand by my
opinion that scribes tend to too much fanciness on scrolls, but I think
that I am justly chastised about ignoring regional variation.

Cait commented that she spent a lot of time, but rationed it carefully, did
not neglect her other scrolls, and still finished a *month* in advance.
That is the regional variation I speak of.  Scribes in the Middle would
*kill* for a month's warning.  Two weeks warning is considered generous
around here, even for Peerage scrolls.  The East is much better about giv-
ing scribes notice, but there are still Reigns where three days is more
the norm.  Eastern scribes, consider this:  Virtually every Reign in the
Midrealm is like your *worst* Reigns.  There are two ways to deal with this
system; either do scrolls that are less intricate, or give promissories.

To Juls (?) on the subject of the Western backlog:  I have given this a
lot of thought, and if you folks really want to give real scrolls to your
people, the only solution I can see is to forget the backlog.  At least for
now.  You say that you only have 10-20 scribes in the whole Kingdom, and I
suspect that's because scribing is not an exciting business there (how could
it be, with a 1000 pieces of paper hanging over your head?).  We recruit our
scribes because of the small excitements like when a nice piece is presented
in Court and a gasp comes up from the crowd.

I suggest that you get your scribes together, few as they are, and tell them
that from henceforth you intend to present real scrolls in Court, especially
for the AoAs.  Get them to do blank AoA scrolls if you can.  Tell the Royals
that you would like to try out this new policy, and ask for extra notice
whenever possible.  With any luck at all, people will get excited about the
real scrolls, and you might even get offers of help.  And if you can pre-
sent all the scrolls in any given Court, the backlog will not get any worse;
when you have acquired some new scribes, then you can get back to it.

Of course, this requires a small change in policy, that you not require an
AoA recipient to have passed arms before you give them the scroll.  This
has been policy in the East and Middle for several years, and we have not
suffered by it.  We simply leave a space for the blazon and the emblazon,
which the recipient can have filled in later, and the Principal herald
will not sign the scroll (making it official) until the arms are registered.

Subject: Greadan's Blazon

My two cents' worth on the three-triangles-in-chief problem:

My favourite blazons for this one are "a chief indented of three throughout"
or "a chief dancetty of three throughout".  We have put this to Greadan and
he thought them to be ambiguous, but since they were My Idea, I just had to
ask for everybody's opinions on them.

Subject: Group Statistics

Since Ragnar brought the subject up and since the Regnum is completed and
ready for its quarterly mailing to the BoD and the Kingdom Seneschals, I
thought the Rialto might be interested in the following:

Total number of Kingdoms: 12
Total number of Principalities: 9
Total number of Baronies and Provinces: 114
Total number of Shires (includes Dominions, Ports, and Strongholds): 310
Total number of Cantons (includes Colleges, Marches, Rigings, and
Baliwicks): 158  
Total Groups in the SCA: 591 (not counting incipient or suspended groups)

The Kingdom with the most groups is the East with a total of 107.
The Middle has a total of 92 groups.
The Kingdom with the smallest number of groups is the Outlands with 21,
followed by Atenveldt with 25.

Outside of the United States (with groups in all 50 states and the District
of Columbia), we have groups in Australia (19), Canada (Alberta, B.C.,
Manitoba, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan),
England (3), Finland (1), Germany (14), Holland (1), Italy (1), Japan (2),
Korea (1), New Zealand (1), Okinawa (1), Panama Canal Zone (1), and Sweden
(3).

I may enter something in Calligraphy and Illumination someday, just 
because I want to show off (and because there IS good feedback for
that category in the Middle), but I find the 'substitute tourney'

Subject: Shakespeare plays

My favorite has to be the Flying Karamozov Brothers' version of "A Comedy of
Errors".  I saw the "last performance" which was televised (they extended the
run of the play after scheduling the broadcast.)   The lines were so
understandable (thanks to much of the broad acting) that I didn't think they
were the original lines from the play!  I went and looked it up later, and was
amazed how much of the play was used verbatim.  I especially loved the part
where the hefty cook who is chasing after the wrong servant is being
described..."She is spherical, like a globe; I could find out continents in
her"  and "When doomsday comes, she'll burn a week longer than the whole world"!
  (paraphrasing mine) 

I think this is an excellent example of staging Shakespeare to make it
accessible to modern audiences, without losing much of the original flavor. 

(And the juggling was fantastic, of course!)

Dealing with the guy next door
 -----------------------------

Dear Genghis,
	I have a problem. The guy next door is giving me a problem. His house
is much nicer and bigger than mine. I would like to occupy it. The problem is,
he has attack dogs and I can't get through the gate. On top of that, his wife
is bigger than me. What should I do? Would it be all right to attempt a hostile
take-over? Should I only dream about it? I do have lots of friends that would
help me accomplish any advice I might get from you.
						The guy in the Small House

Dear Guy,
	Why enlist your friends' help just to get a puny house? What kind of
stinking wimp are you? Here's what you should do: Get a few large pieces of 
balsa wood. Make them into roughly shaped boxes, and fill them with garbage
bags full of kerosene. Make a simple catapuly, light the balsa wood on fire,
and lob a few of those suckers into the yard in order to take out the dogs.
	Next, you will want to charge straight into the front yard, where your
stinking neighbor will probably be whining and crying about his flaming dogs.
This will slow his reflexes and obscure his vision so that you can decapitate
him with a simple blow of your broadsword. (If you have no broadsword, you can
buy a machete at K-mart. But of course, the broadsword is preferable.) His
wife will be so impressed with your bravery and strength that she will let you
have the house and her virtue.

Nicolette Bonhomme
sends all good greetings unto
the good folk of the Rialto

Good gentles,

Would like to open a can of worms for the Rialto to discuss. Few things
get my blood boiling.  In fact, people often have a hard time getting me
to have a strong opinion one way or another on passion-ridden issues
like politics, religion, etc.  However, when something causes me to get
vehement, I take notice, therefore, I would like to see if anyone else
shares my (likely to be unpopular) opinion in the following:

Arts Competitions:

   - Have nothing to do with the Middle Ages lifestyle that I can deduce
   - Incourage 'merit-badge' attitude
   - Are culprits for people becoming dissatisfied: 'I entered such-and
          such competitions and haven't recieved a (fill in appropriate
          arts award) yet'
   - Are *not* vehicles for helpful commentary - the line between
          constructive criticism and viciousness is, to quote
          a friend, "vanishingly thin"
   - Encourage burn-out: Nearly everyone I know who entered something
          in Ice Dragon, the *large* Eastern arts competition, was so
          burned trying to make the March deadline that they produced
          nothing at all for quite some time after that
   - Are expressly counter to the idea that the joy is in the doing
   - Are discourging to 'starters', people who feel that only the best
          and the brightest have the right to let their work be seen in
          public
   - Are *not* necessary to encourage research and scholarship; I and
          several friends have happily spent vacation days sequestered
          in museum libraries, hunting through extant pieces and archae-
          logical reports and such

What think you?

Subject: Middle Age Dyes (or, if you prefer) Heraldric Colors

I would like to ask for the assistance of people on the net with the
compilation of colors of textile dyes from middle ages (and/or 
renaissance).

I wish to establish heraldric colors for various families/organizations
in my (not quite) AD&D campaign.  To do this, however, I would like to
compile a list of colors (and associated availability, read cost) found
in garments in the 16th century.  I'd like to note that I do not need
to confine this information to Europe -- other cultures, e.g. Japaneese
or Chineese, are equally valid (although, I would like to know what
culture if it is not European).  I am cross-posting this the rec.org.sca
because I know that you guys and gals are the foremost authority on
historic tid-bits from this genre.

I can come up with a few --
  - Yellow, Green, Blue, Orange, maybe Red -- each from readily available 
    plants
  - Brown, Black, and Grey should be readily available
  - Royal Purple -- didn't that come from some shell found in the far east?
  - Burgundy -- from wine
  - White -- did some form of bleach exist, or did rich people just keep
    originally white fabrics clean?
  - Rust -- can't get those stains out today :->
  - Tan -- most cloth just starts out this way

  any others?

Please email me any information that you may have.  I thank all of you
in advance.

Subject: SCA Information for Teachers

This is the answer to a question that hasn't been asked--but should be.

According to Sir Hilary of Serendip, the Registry has information packets
oriented for teachers.  Should a teacher need materials for studying the
Society's period, the Regisrty will send one of these packets in response
to a letter of inquiry.

This--of course--supports the Society's purpose as an educational 
organization, but I think it serves the very good purpose of helping
education in this country as well.  (And others, too, but the US 
probably needs the most help in this area.)

More than that -- because of rationing and the use of film as a
morale-builder, film production in wartime England were under quite a lot of
supervision by the war office; funds generally went to those films which
would be considered patriotic, or good entertainment for the troops.
(Churchill himself tended to do a lot in the final thumbs up/down decision
-- he enjoyed it, apparently.)  Olivier got funding for this by pushing that
it would be a great choice for a patriotic film, with England running down
the field during the last half, with four minutes left on the clock and no
substititue players, and a whole mess of Frog goalies... well, you get the
picture.   Churchill bought it, and the film got made.  (Technicolor was
still not cheap at that point in time.)

Wonderful!  I completely missed that line.  It's *so* nice to know how
far back winning was less important than beating the point spread :-)

>It's kind of obvious that he isn't really mad...

No, but it is clear that he *is*, in fact, melancholic.  This is not his 
natural state, but the death of his father, the marriage of his mother,
and the loss of the crown to his uncle conspire to overturn the 
sanguinity which is proper to his station (and which we see at the start
of the play).  Much of his subsequent behavior is consistent with that
which Elizabethans would expect from a man whose humours have fallen out
of balance in this way.  (Thwarted love or ambition could often bring
about a dominance of black bile -- melancholy.)  The choler Hamlet displays
towards the end of the play is far healthier.  (It also lends credence to
the interpretation that a fair amount of time has passed, since sanguinity
gives way to choler as youth gives way to maturity.)

>Why does Lear split his kingdom? 

That play explicitly portrays his decline into madness and senility, a
the process of adustation (a shift from wet humours to dry ones which
accompanies age) which takes him down the path from a choleric personality 
to a melancholic one.

I can go on about humours for a long time :-)
It's worth remembering that a layman's knowledge of the mental and physical 
effects of the four humours was an intrinsic part of the background of the 
theatre-going public of the time, and that explicit or implicit references 
to them was a rich source of context and expectations for that audience.

(It's also worth remembering that in Shakespeare's plays, everything means
something, but not everything means a lot :-) :-)

Remember, we are using medievel heraldry, *not* what it evolved into
'over the centuries'. A pile is by no means an equilateral triangle,
I have seen the arcane term 'triangle' applies to this charge...  :^)
Piles will extend nearly to the base (I know, there's one, and little
else, on my arms), and will not leave 2/3 of the field bare. The other
idea mentioned, a chief dancetty of 3, isn't quite right either, as the
'notches' would not come all the way to the top edge of the field.

The probably blazon would have something like 3 triangles inverted 
conjoined in fedd, in chief enhanced (uhh, is that the right term
for shoving it all the way up?). If they are to span the width of the
field, you'll need a way to describe that as well, charges don't go to 
the edges by default (except for most ordinaries, of course).

Yes, although I can't think of a good green off the top of my head.
Let's ask Parker..."To dye woollen green, either a blue or yellow dye
may be first given to it, but the first is generally used because the
yellow dye of the stuff would injure the blue bath..."  (Blues are
notoriously tricky: "Blue may be dyed with woad alone, which would
give a permanent but not a deep blue; but if indigo be mixed with it,
a very rich colour will be obtained.  The following is a method:"
followed by over two pages of complex directions.)

>  - Royal Purple -- didn't that come from some shell found in the far east?
Rubens (_A_History_Of_Jewish_Costume_) discusses _techeleth_,"made
from chemicals mixed with the juice of a mollusc similar to the
_murex_brandaris_ which produced the rare Tyrian purple dye ulti-
mately reserved for royalty.  These shellfish were so much sought
after that they were almost exterminated; by Talmudic times [say,
3rd-6th centuries] the _techeleth_ dye had become unobtainable."

How do you get "originally white fabrics" without bleach?  The whitest
sheepswool and flax are still sorta cream, I think.
Wait a minute: Parker describes an eminently period-feasible, if
lengthy (over a month) process for bleaching linen by alternately
steeping it in potash solution and leaving it spread on the grass,
then finally neutralizing the potash with a weak acid bath.  There
are various other, more chemically sophisticated, methods described,
but they all amount to steeping in an alkaline solution.  He doesn't
mention a method for wool.

>  any others?
Cochineal scarlet or crimson.  Parker again:
"Scarlet dying, in general, is a distinct and separate branch of
the trade... part of the apparatus being somewhat different from
common dying, the boiler in which the cochineal bath is made, is
generally of tin or strongly tinned copper, because a solution of
tin is the mordant used in the process, and therefore no mischief
can arise from its being in contact with the same metal....  The
effect of tin in heightening the colour of cochineal was dis-
covered by a German chymist named Huster, who settled at Bow,
then in the vicinity of London, in the year 1543...."

The "Parker" to whom I refer is in full "The Arcana of Arts and
Sciences, or, Farmers' and Mechanics' Manual; containing a Great
Variety of Valuable Receipts and Useful Discoveries, in the Various
Departments of Human Knowledge; many of which were Never Before
Published," by Dr. M. Parker, 1824.  (And I've got the 1824 printing
on my bookshelf, nyah nyah.)

BB13093@pbn33.prime.com (Nicolette Bonhomme) writeth
>(various negative comments about Arts Competitions)

I'd like to flame this, but unfortunately I basically agree with all
Nicolette's comments.  This is partially due to excessive reading of
the works of Cariadoc in my impressionable youth, and partially
because I'm not particularly into contests of any sort.

I can imagine certain sorts of contests that WOULD be period.  Many
events have a particular theme and center around one or two thoroughly
frivolous contests of the sort one can imagine bored nobles inventing
to entertain one another at a party.  Said bored nobles would of
course know better than to take the results of said frivolous contest
at all seriously; they were already better than most of the people
around them, and if they wanted to prove which was better than whom,
they could do that quite nicely with either politics or arms.

One type of contest that is most ESPECIALLY non-period, as Cariadoc
points out, is the documentation contest.  In a nutshell, documen-
tation is not period.  Arguing over the relative reliability of
various 19th-century sources as to what year such-and-such embroidery
stitch was invented, so you can decide whether you've ever seen it, is
not period.  It is perhaps important for our 20th-century selves, so
as to improve the accuracy and consistency of our medieval illusion,
but our period personae cannot possibly do it.

More generally, it must be remembered that the awards and contest
prizes are merely _formal_recognition_ of what you can do; they do not
_define_ what you can do.  Last week I heard with horror a newbie ask
"Do I have to be a Bard to be in the bardic circle?"  I told her (more
or less) "If you sing, play, tell stories, whatever, then you are a Bard.
If you do these things well, then you are a Good Bard.  If people
notice how well you do these things, then you are a Recognized Bard.
That's all a Bard is.  And if you don't feel like performing something
at the bardic circle, nobody will scoff at you."

This attitude may be responsible for my never having _received_ any
awards or contest prizes (save an amazingly ugly "white elephant"
model longship for a saga-telling contest I entered purely because
I'd just written this neat poem, and wanted people to hear it): I'm
here to have fun and learn something, not to win prizes.

In hope that I'm not being TOO disgustingly pure at heart, I am

   Obviously by what you write, and the way you have written it, my posting
gave you a great deal of concern.  While I may agree with the sentiment of
your editorial, I think you have missed the point of the posting.

   'The World According to Student Bloopers' was written by Richard Lederer,
a middle school teacher.  I am sure when he began compiling this article for
VERBATIM, he was not attempting to show a lack of education in his students,
nor was he trying to insult the I.Q. of any student.  Bloopers are maladies
which strike down both beggar and King.  I'll never forget the time I stood
before my entire 10th grade astronomy class and proceded to explain how
'... If the Viking probe had found life on Mars, the ORGASM would have been
microscopic.'  Indeed, the shine in my face rivaled that of the red planet
for a week.
   Also, The Language Quarterly, VERBATIM, is a publication dedicated to
education and helping teachers understand why misunderstandings take place.
Look at the article again and I think you'll see more evidence of 'ignorance
due to peculiarities of language' than to lack of education.  Proof-reading
could have saved several of these bloopers from their embarrassing fate.
( A SIDE NOTE HERE:  Ever try proof-reading your typed copy of a blooper
article?  I must have inadvertantly corrected 5 or 6 bloopers and had to
change them back.)

At any rate, if 'The World According to Student Bloopers' could only inspire
you to think 'What a terrible system we have here...', then I apologize for
posting it where you could see it, but I think you shouldn't question the
thoughtfulness of the blooper-submitters, author, publisher, poster, and
MOSTLY... anyone who thinks it is funny.  Laughing at ourselves seldom makes
the world anything but a better place.

I have a question for any out there with knowledge of Germanic Heraldry.
I have been working on a device, and came across this charge in a Fox/Davies
text. For whatever reason they spent many pages on Germanic Heraldry, but
only gave the blazoning for those charges which could be brought to British
Heraldry, (if only imperfectly). Does anybody know the term for this charge,
and hopefully the rules pertaining to its use and the use of the charge they
give as: Wolfs Teeth.

Well-bleached flax is really white, not cream.  There's a mail-order
house name of Herrschner's which sells (in among ~50 pages of the most
appalling kitschy embroidery kits) "handkerchief linen" in real, honest
white.  

It is possible to bleach linen without using potash or any chemical.
It takes even longer than Parker's version.  It is exceedingly period.
Grow the flax during the summer.  When it's grown, pull it and soak
the stems in the stream for weeks till they rot.  During the fall,
hackle and rett the flax (in other words, get the internal fibres
out of the stem).  During the winter, spin the thread and weave the
fabric.  It is now about the color of cafe-au-lait.  Lay it out in the
meadow--yes, the snow is still on the ground; so what?  Whenever it gets
too deeply covered by the snowfall, haul it out and spread it out on
top again.  Let it get whatever sun there is.  When the snow is gone
and the rains have stopped, sprinkle it with water every day or so.
When it's white enough, bring it in.  It ought to be ready by the
beginning of summer.

In your basic Early Period Germanic tribe, a new king/chief was elected by
the members of the tribe (that is, the free adults, probabably males
only)--but the candidates all had to be from the royal family (which was
originally supposed to be descended from some god or other*).  Later on
the electorate was narrowed to the heads of the noble families, and so
it remained till, I believe, the nineteenth century.  Remember the
Elector of Brandenburg, for whom Bach wrote the Brandenburg Concerti?
He had (along with various lands, money, and perks) the privilege of
helping decide which Hapsburg would be the next Holy Roman Emperor.

So when Old Hamlet died the electors met to decide who would succeed him,
and while Young Hamlet was certainly a front-running contender, they
didn't _have_ to elect him.  In the event, they apparently decided that
Claudius, a mature, sensible man and also the son of a king, was a better
choice than Young Hamlet who wasn't dry behind the ears yet, who was
taking the shock of his father's death very badly, and who was probably
bringing home all sorts of weird ideas from Wittenberg anyway.  George
Lyman Kittredge, in his notes to the Yale Shakespeare series, points out
that Hamlet says "popp'd in between th'election and my hopes" -- not
"my rights."

Moving to a different Germanic tribe, L. Sprague de Camp's** novel _Lest
Darkness Fall_ takes a twentieth-century archaeologist and drops him into
the sixth-century Kingdom of the Goths and Italians.  When it comes time
to make sure the right guy gets elected King, Padway introduces all the
modern conveniences of 20th-century politics, as posters, political slogans,
a ward-heelers' picnic, damaging innuendo, mud-slinging and guilt by
association, *sigh* ...

Subject: Kids, minorities

Greetings!

In reply to Awilda Halfdane's remarks regarding education, humor, etc.:  
firstly, I would be the last to ridicule a student to their face or before 
their peers for the sort of mistakes which made up the strung together history 
of the world.  I think it would be wrong to do so.  However, that doesn't mean 
the lines aren't funny.  They are.  I see nothing wrong in being amused by 
them, as the piece was presented in such a manner as to _not_ indicate 
original authorship.

I am not going to debate Awilda's rationale(s) about education, the value (as
in lack of) of children in American society, daycare, etc., for the simple
reason that there are no simple explanations, pat answers, or ready solutions.
Nor am I at all certain this is entirely the venue for such a discussion. 

However, I would like to say two other things.  

First, my Barony has always attempted to meet requests for speakers from *any*
legitimate group.  This has, at times, included not only schools but such
groups as service groups for the handicapped.  To get us, all they have to do 
is ask-- but they do need to ask; how else shall we know?

Second, about the question of minorities in the SCA:  being in the SCA in 
Dixie, this question has come up a number of times.  The only minority 
represented to any real extent is the handicapped.  I have, however, talked to 
some of the few black members down here.  The answer I kept getting turned out 
to be pretty simple:  for many ethnic minorities, the SCA holds no attraction 
whatsoever.  For example, only one of the black members I have been personally
acquainted with had an interest in Africa or even the Middle East.  The others
are all interested in Western Europe. 

Now, we can all probably think of *lots* of things that *ought* to interest 
gentles of a great variety of ethnic persuasions.  That doesn't change the 
fact that they're not. 

Personally, I have never encountered any form of discrimination in the SCA.  
Stupidity, yes; discrimination, no.  Matter of fact, IMHO one of our biggest 
problems is that we are entirely too tolerant.  Leads to lots of problem cases 
being tolerated instead of booted out _via_ peer pressure or some other means.

All in all, the SCA is lot better than a lot of other places.  So, lighten up 
a little, okay Awilda?  :-)

Subject: Amleth, Blazon

Greetings all from Richard DeLacy,

        On Hamlet, Rev Mom. has a good list of references, all I can add is
that the Saxo Grammaticus book is called the Gesta Danorum.  It is a long
history of Danish Legends, many of which are interesting in their own right,
and only a small part of which are the Hamlet stuff (in its original form,
where Claudius marrying gertrude is not only not shocking, it is expected -
he marries his brother's widow, just like he assumes his brother's debts!)
Dellaforrest's french novel is somewhat interesting, although it is not
entirely clear that shakespeare had read it, Unlike the play by Kid, which
he certainly had and we unfortunately don't.

        And speaking of references, my favorite for being wildly variable
is the Riverside Shakespeare itself.  Great versions of the plays with
some useful notes . . . and other notes that just amaze!  Like a note on
the word "ill":

        ill: not well.

Wow!!!!  is that what the word meant!  (That one is either from Hamlet or
Richard III, I can't remember now.)



        Now the Blazon with the three triangles I have seen somewhere called
"passion nails".  However, I have also seen passion nails to mean sort of
two tetrahedrons, touching at their bases, one regular one pointing up and
one three times as long as wide pointing down. (I know, that's complicated, but
it looks simpler and I am just describing it poorly)


                Yours, Richard

This is not surprising.  German heraldry used all sorts of charges and
divisions of the field which do not appear in English or French
armory.  Blazonry in any language is ideosyncratic, and does not
translate well.  For most of the odd German practices, English
blazonry simply has no way to describe them.

The charge you drew, i.e., the y-shaped piece in the middle, does not
have a name in English blazonry.  We have blazoned it in negative,
since each of the outer pieces is called "a gusset."  So, if the
middle is red and the outsides are gold, the design is "Or, two
gussets gules."  If you wish to use it, I would recommend including
with your submission a reference to the discussion of it in your
source and, if possible, the German blazon.

Wolf's teeth are narrow curved wedges issuing from the flank of the
field, which look a little like long teeth.  If you had to describe
them in English blazonry, they'd be "piles issuant from sinister flank
and enarched."  Happily, you don't.  Wolf's teeth have been used in
SCA armory, and are acceptable charges with that blazon.

I think I may have seen that production. I remember seeing at the Royal 
Shakespeare Theatre where some of the speeches were delivered from a sort 
of flying trapeze/swing affair suspended above the stage. I don't really know
whether or not it was good Shakespeare. Too much of my attention was on 
examining the swing's support system, and working out how they fitted a 
safety belt into the actor's costume. I remember his safety line was 
visible to one side. I assume it was supposed to be behind him. I wish I
could concentrate more on the play and the characters when watching that type
of production, but I also wish director's did not delight in scattering
distractions around their productions.

Right -- as soon as I finished saying, "The Rolls will be coming out
Real Soon Now", they hit my machine. People should note that the data
is actually as of a few weeks before 6 December; it took a while for
me to get all of the data entered, get the list compiled, and send it
off to sca-request...

On a related topic: the Rolls are now around two years old. In that
time, there has not yet been a real re-examination of the data contained
therein. In general, my confidence in the accuracy of the entries is
gradually eroding as time passes. More specifically, I'd bet that a
lot of the Net addresses listed are no longer valid.

*Therefore*, it appears time to do a census for the Rolls. I don't have
time to send mail to each and every person in the Rolls, but I think
that it needs to be done. So, if you have a good deal of energy, and some
time over the next three months, and would like an excuse to electronically 
meet a whole *lot* of folk, talk to me soon -- I'd really like to get an

In the meantime, if your data is incorrect (and I'm sure that lots of

I've only read the book, BROOK'S MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (I think
that's the title), in which a friend of Brook's who is a writer,
was asked to sit in during the rehearsals and keep a record of
what was going on, journal-style.  He talks mostly about freeing
the verse, and the amount of attention that was given to
breathing life into the language.  But also given the amount of
stuff that was being done, I can imagine it overwhelming the
audience.  The guy who wrote the book (and Brook) was also extremely 
struck by Frances DeLaTour's performance (Helena). 

From what I gather, the reviews were highly polarized, and you
either loved it or hated it.  (This was also, BTW, the production
Joyce Grenfell invited Helene Hanff to see.  She loved it. :-)

That's my opinion, too.  I'm one of those heretics who *prefers*
modern dress.  And (aside from using the old saw that "Well, *Shakespeare*
was doing everything modern dress") I still can't see why people
get upset whenever they're not confronted with Elizabethan costumes.
(Honestly.  A few months ago, I saw a set-in-the-turn-of-the-century
production of MEASURE FOR MEASURE [which I hated, since no one
had thought of doing more than plastering most of the main
symbols into the set design], and in the after-play talk-with-the-actors, 
someone actually stood up and asked, "Why didn't you set it in
the period Shakespeare meant it to be?"  Honest.  Someone really did.)

It's been over fifty years since Alec Guinness did his modern-dress
Hamlet, and it was by no means the first (or last.  Richard
Burton's was also modern dress).  It's practically a tradition, by now...  

(not that modern dress ensures a great production.  It's just
that 90% of the productions that stick in my mind were 
modern/non-Elizabethan dress. (The 10% was Derek Jacobi :-). )

A pile (at least in SCA emblazon) should extend almost to the base
point of the shield, so "3 piles" is not a very good description of the
described figure--Freyja's laundromat seems to be describing much
shorter objects.

Can I do better? The diminuative of a pile would probably be skinnier,
but not much shorter (by analogy to "pale").  A better approach would
be to start from a chief triangular, since that extends only 1/3 of the
way down the shield, like the described figure.  But "3 chiefs triangular" 
sounds a bit too odd...

Eureka! "A chief triangular of three."

I think your attribution's wrong, since the Royal Shakespeare
Company did their tryouts somewhere in England before taking it
to London's West End, and then Broadway.  (there's a book called
PETER BROOK'S MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM which follows the
development of the play through first rehearsals up to opening
night.  Lots of pictures, and some good insights into both the 
play and the production.)

Actually, the Olivier KING LEAR, while looking a lot like one of
the BBC plays, wasn't part of the BBC/PBS series.  I believe
Michael Holdern was the BBC Lear.

My public library downtown has quite a few of the BBC/PBS
Shakespeare plays on video tape.  They're pretty easy to find, I
think.

John Barton's PLAYING SHAKESPEARE series, on the other hand, I've
only seen in UC campus libraries (although a friend of mine in
NYC said that the local PBS station there was playing it for a
while.)  If you ever want to learn how to speak Shakespearean blank
verse, I'd recommend watching it.   Ben Kingsley, Ian McKellan,
Judi Dench (she wasn't a Dame then :-), Jane Lapoitaire, Patrick 
Stewart, Alan Howard, Dame Peggy Ashcroft, Michael Pennington,
Michael Williams, David Suchet... they all show up.  It's ten one-hour 
episodes that expands on a South Bank Show two-hour special with Trevor
Nunn, John Barton and lots of RSC actors talking about how to do
Shakespeare.

When they get to pronunciation, it's pretty amazing.  Barton
doing the French King's list of knights from Henry V is heady,
rich stuff.  And the last scene from Winter's Tale, with Patrick
Stewart as Leontes had me in tears.  And Suchet and Stewart did
the infamous shared line from King John so fast, I just gaped.

My lord?
          A grave.

One continuous flow from two different people, but with every

Blame Coleridge.  He was one of the major proponents of the

I saw that special when it came out, and haven't heard a peep

A&E played one of the Stratford, Ontario Festival's TAMING OF THE
SHREW, with Len Cariou.  It was pretty complete text (they even
closed the framework with the Tinker, Christopher Sly, using
Jonson's (?) ending.)

I would say that definitely applies to their AS YOU LIKE IT. (it
was wretched, even *with* Helen Mirren.)  I think a lot of the
problem with the BBC plays, is that they knew those versions were
going to be used as a sort of reference set.  Therefore, they
couldn't be too wild in interpretation, and the whole
"for-posterity" thing sometimes got in the way.  Of all the BBC
comedies, I think I only like TWELFTH NIGHT and TAMING OF THE
SHREW.

I agree that the traditional interpretation of Hamlet as the dreamy,
romantic, undecisive guy in a black velvet doublet is kind of
silly, and that Hamlet's got a damn good reason for not rushing
right out and killing Claudius, but there are a few things said
I take disagreement with.  I think that Shakespeare is always rich in
ambiguity, and too complex to ever be completely held in any single 
interpretation.  And that the biggest problem with staging
Shakespeare are the solid ideas you hold about the characters and
plot that have nothing to do with what the text tells you.

(Oh, and BTW, please don't think I'm learned or anything, because
I'll be popping off quotes.  I've got my Riverside in my lap, and
I've just recently read the play.)
 
>Hamlet himself is not the wishy washy character he is usually protrayed as.
>For one thing,  he's a man thirty years old, as attested by the grave-digger.

This is only *after* he gets back from that long sea-voyage.
Time is relatively compacted, but it's never explicitly stated
how long he's been away.  The question of how old Hamlet is at
the beginning vs. how old he is at the end is vital to any
production.  I like to believe it's been about five years,
simply because of the *immense* change in his character (i.e.
passive to active) and the fact that he's a university student at
the beginning of the play.

Of course, that seems a little long.  And Hamlet himself says,
"this three years.." to Horatio (V.i.139-140).  But remember
what's happened since he's left: Polonius has been hastily
interred, Hamlet's been attacked/rescued by pirates, Laertes has
had the time to come back from Paris, and get the people behind
his cause, and nearly takes the crown from Claudius, while
Fortinbras has given up trying to reconquer Denmark and is going
after poor Poland instead.  Lotsa time involved.

>Second, he is the best swordsman in Denmark (which is the big reason Laertes,
>the number two swordsman in Denmark is so jealous and hostile to him).  

Wrong.  First off, Laertes wants to kill Hamlet because Hamlet
killed his father and (indirectly) his sister.  Not jealousy over
fencing skills.  And he's been planning on the murder for quite a
while.  I mean, Claudius casually mentions that they could
possibly slip in an unbated sword for this fencing match Hamlet's
been dying to have with you...and Laertes immediately says
something about having bought this poison.  

And if you reread the text, you'll see that Laertes is
definitely the better swordsman of the two.  The original
challenge comes through Osric, in the form of a wager between
Laertes and the King.  And they lay odds (V.ii.165-167):

The King, sir, hath laid, sir that in a dozen passes between
yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
laid on twelve for nine...

And Horatio, hearing the odds, says to Hamlet, "You will lose, my
lord."  To which Hamlet replies with an, "I shall win at the
odds." 

>In the final act this courageous, proud man is
>stung to duel Laertes by Laerteas taunts about his skill and courage.

Laertes doesn't do any taunting.  Hamlet asks Laertes for
forgiveness, pleading madness for Polonius' murder.  And Laertes
answer somewhat stiffly, but courteously, that he does forgive
Hamlet, if he can do so with honor.  In fact, it's Laertes who
thinks that Hamlet's taunting him, when Hamlet makes the line
about being but a (pun alert) foil to Leartes's talent.

>He is a man with iron nerve.  

Only after the trip to England, and most of his major action
occurs offstage (i.e. the sea battle.)  Before that he's a 
major procrastinator.  [And after four and a half years of 
college and semi-bad grades, I know about procrastination, and 
sympathize utterly.]

>This is the story of a man deprived of his crown, 

This is also questionable.  

Hamlet says that Claudius, "Popp'd in between th' election and my
hopes." (V.ii.65)   Election?  I don't think that the rulers were
democratically elected, but I do think that popular support had a
lot to do with whether or not someone became ruler.  After all,
the support of the rabble shouting, "Laertes shall be king!" got
Claudius to backpedal fast on not honoring Polonius' death, and
it was popular opinion that kept him from having Hamlet killed
outright for Polonius' death.

My pet theory is that the old Hamlet was an abusive
husband/father, and that Claudius (loving Gertrude and the young
Hamlet), couldn't take it any more and killed his rotten
brother.  I mean, here's his country, complete steeped in war by
the Dane, and he can put everything to rights.

And if you think that's completely wild, remember that he's got
the complete, wholehearted support of the court for his marriage
("...nor have we herein barred/Your better wisdoms, which have
freely gone/With this affair along."), and he had to have some
popular support to get the crown.  Not to mention that he's
stated explicitly that Hamlet's the heir to the crown. ("For let
the world take note/ You are the most immediate to our throne.")

And then there's the Moustrap...

It kind of tickles me at how most people believe the play really
is the thing to catch the conscience of the king.  Look, if it's
really the proof of his guilt, then why doesn't Claudius react to
the dumbshow immediately preceding it?  (All the actions w/out
dialogue.  Poison poured in the ear and EVERYTHING.)  I think
he's too smart to give himself away like that.

Not to mention that the play itself is seen by the unsuspecting
court as an threat by Hamlet upon Claudius' life.  I mean, the
murderer in the play is identified as, "nephew to the king."
Claudius only reacts when he gets fed up with Hamlet's taunting.

But no.  Olivier films it as the dramatic clutch to the heart,
and fall back in the chair of a supremely guilty conscience.
Well, at least it makes the "confession" scene easier.  :-)  But
I still like the idea of an abusive old Hamlet, since Claudius'
greatest crime is that he can't feel remorse for his deed.

>motivated  by pride and
>virtue, to set right a wrong for which he has no proof. In the first scene
>Hamlet is depressed and slovenly.  

Again, depends on how it's staged.  All we know for certain is
that he's dressed in black.  He can be played as angry, moody,
sullen, grief-striken, hysterical, etc.etc.

>He's just lost his beloved father and had
>his mother marry an unfavorite uncle.  

I only take exception to the "unfavorite" uncle. (see pet theory
above :-)  There's no real indication of how Hamlet feels about 
Claudius *as a person*, only as the usurper of his father's
place (In my interpretation.  It's certainly not the mainstream
one, and there's a lot of beautiful ranting by Hamlet that
supports the other view.)

>The ghost rouses him from his depression and calls him to action.  
>But if
>murder was done, then an alert, active Hamlet is not going to be appreciated
>by the murderer.  

And as Orson Welles said, "There'd be no play."  :-)

One of the neatest interpretations I ever saw of the Ghost was
from a clip on the South Bank Show, where they showed Jonathan
Pryce (Jack from BRAZIL) as Hamlet, being *possessed* by Old
Hamlet, and saying things like "List, list O list" in a voice
straight out of the Exorcist.  Awesome. 

>And so Hamlet continues to pretend to be depressed and
>apathetic.  

Ah, the question of Hamlet's madness.  Another big juicy subject.
It's kind of obvious that he isn't really mad (witness Ophelia's
scenes for contrast), but it's neat stuff to conjecture just how
weird he gets inside his head.  I've always liked the fact that
Hamlet's natural state is to speak in verse, and that he only
speaks in prose when he's being "mad."

Again, I have to disagree.  There's tons of ambiguity and room
for interpretation in just about every play.  *Why* is Petruchio 
taming Kate?, Why the hell does Leontes, for no reason, get jealous 
of his wife?  Where the hell does an upright uptight guy like Angelo decide to
go seducing/raping an almost-nun like Isabella?  And why does the
Duke let Isabella think her brother is dead?  Where the hell
does Posthumous get off believing Iachimo about Imogen, and why
the hell does she let him hit her and still take him back?  Why
does Lear split his kingdom?  Who's killing Caesar and why?  Why
does Iago try to split up Othello and Desdemona (is he really
jealous of Cassio's rank?  Or is he in love with Othello?
[honest.  Major argument used for some time.  Olivier talks about
the one time he and Richardson(?) did Othello and Iago extremely
swish and got bawled out by the director. :-]

And as for straight forward about who's doing what and why, try
and get someone to give you a quick synopsis of COMEDY OF
ERRORS.  Or the Henry VI plays...

HAMLET is, however, undoubtedly, one of the more complex plays
Shakespeare's written.  If only from the fact that there are five
quarto versions (one based on an ur-play [whatever that
means--someone out there know?], and two based on that one) and
the Folio version.  One of the "bad" quartos has Claudius
suggesting the poison right off the bat, and later on Gertrude
swears to Hamlet that she'll help him get rid of Claudius.  
Don't you love conflated texts?  [There, Dani, I said the dread
word "conflated"! :-) ]

This is not an easy one, and, remarkably, it has been discussed
several times recently in the College of Arms.  

The charges described cannot be corretly blazoned "three piles".  In
period armory, piles ALWAYS extend all the way across the field.
Three piles are sometimes blazoned "palewise" if they remain parallel,
or "in point" if the two outer ones angle in, so that all three nearly
meet just above the base of the shield.  These two styles of piles are
equivalent: They were used interchangeably for the same arms in
period.  The difference in depiction was probably a function of the
shape of the shield or banner.  One upshot of this research is that
the College of Arms no longer allows charges to be placed below one or
more piles.

The description "a chief indented" is also dicey.  In the standard
heraldry texts, the upward points of a chief indented do not reach the
top of the shield.  Sam'l's suggested "a chief indented enhanced" is
clever, but impossible: a chief cannot be enhanced (moved up), since
it's already at the top of the field.  As it happens, the picture
described was a form of "chief indented" used by early period Scottish
heralds.  In later times, English heralds, at a loss to describe the
charge, often settled on "three piles."  In the SCA, I would recommend
submitting the charge as "a chief indented," and hope that the College
will either find documentation for that form of the charge, or that
we'll come up with a better blazon.  One way or the other, I think the
charge should be acceptable.

Subject: Dear Genghis: An Advise Column (1 of 3)

Dealing with an unfaithful lover
 -------------------------------

Dear Genghis,
	I am a 19-year old Pitt student majoring in communications. "Muffy" and
I have been in the same soroity for two years, and we were best friends from
the time we met at freshman orientation. Last week, I found Muffy in bed with
my fience, "Skippy."
	I have been deeply hurt and don't know what to do. I can't break my
engagement with Skippy because he'll take his credit card back. And I just
couldn't even stand to look at Muffy at the mixer last night. Do you think we
should all go for some sort of counseling? Or perhaps Daddy will let me get
away from it all in the Bahamas. Oh Genghis, I'm so confused!
							Deeply Wounded Buffy

Dear Buffy,
	The solution to your problem is so simple and elegant that when I tell
it to you, I am sure that you will chuckle indulgently to yourself and say,
"Why didn't I think of that?"
	The first thing that you will need is a spear. If you don't have a
conventional spear, then any long piece of sharpened wood will do. I recommend
the pole from one of those flags that the Boy Scouts and American Legion march
with. Now, go to Muffy's house. Ride your trusty steed (or a Harley-Davidson)
around the house at least eight times, while letting forth as might a war cry
as you can muster from your tiny little woman-lungs. When she emerges, leap
from your steed (Harley) and drive the spear through her chest. When doing
this, make sure that the point enters the chest in the center, just below the
sternum, so you can avoid the bone. Make an upward thrusting motion upon entry,
which will penetrate her heart, causing brean death within four to six minutes.
	When dealing with Skippy, use the same weapon, but try to make a quiet
and stealthy approach to his home. Wait until the 14th of the month to make
your attack. After he is dead, tie some stones to his body and throw it into
the river. His credit card bill should be arriving right about now, and he will
have until the end of the month before it comes due. Since you are a registered
user, and not a joint card holder, the credit card company has no legal right
to bill you for charges made on his card. With his death undiscovered, his card
will remain active until 10 days after the due date on the bill, which gives
you almost an entire month to charge on his account and take out cash advances.
Be sure to charge a one-way ticket to Cancun during this time so everyone will
think he ran off like the stinking lilly-livered pusillanimous two-timer that
he was.

Since several people have mentioned this (and there is lots of whitespace
available why not.  Does someone out there have a mundane geography that
includes all SCA groups?  This would save me writing a broadcast letter.  Please
post it if you have such a thing as I imagine others will be interrested.

If I haven't seen anything before fri, I will mail to the couriers as I

Dealing with an unthrifty spouse
 -------------------------------

Dear Genghis,
	I have a problem. My wife is driving me insane. Honestly, she just
won't leave me alone.
	All she thinks about is money. The housekeeper takes care of all the
domestic duties, and my wife still refuses to get a job, because it would
conflict with her aerobics class. However, she certainly doesn't mind spending
my hard-earned money. Every month, my credit card bills are outrageous! I don't
know what she does with all the clothes she buys.
	To top it off, she always complains about her stomach pains. She is 
miserable, and insists on seeing a new doctor all of the time (this is partly
because all the doctors say she is a hypochondriac). I mean it, Genghis, I'm
going crazy. I need your advice!
				Just trying to be a nice guy in Akron, Ohio

Dear Nice Guy,
	Well, nice guy is certainly one way to describe you. Another way to
describe you would be with the term "stinking, snot-nosed, pusillanimous, 
yellow-bellied, weasel-faced, stinking wimp."
	Obviously you haven't thought about your situation very much. Obviously
your IQ is somewhat congrous to that of your average concrete block.
	The solution to you situation is quite simple. Your wife a) spends far
too much money, and b) she is driving you batty with her continual complaints
of stomach pains. Both problems can be solved with one action - disembowel her.
With no stomach, she can't very well have pains in it, and this move will also
slow down her shopping sprees just a tad.

Subject: Family Ancestry ...

I am a new subscriber to the SCA mailing list.  Of particular interest to
me is tracing my family ancestry as far back as possible.  For example,
one family name ("Merritt") I have been able to trace back to 1068 to
a Radnoth Merritt who was a land holder under the rule of William I.  He
was killed in battle in 1068 AD.

I'm interested in contacting anyone with information on the following family
names ... in hopes of tracing their history:

1. Spetz/Spets 
2. Stewart  
3. Ennis           
4. Cochrane/McEachren 

Other families that led to the eventual union of these four names are:

1. Beith     8. Fox          15. McElwain     22. Sills
2. Buck      9. Hanley       16. Merritt      23. Snider
3. Campbell 10. Haslett      17. Nylen        24. Snook
4. Conklin  11. Hughson      18. Petersdotter 25. Warehime/Wareham
5. Crowe    12. Linklater    19. Sands        26. Woodhouse
6. Dobbs    13. Lyon         20. Shewmaker
7. Flick    14. Magnusdotter 21. Sigsworth

If you have any information concerning the origin of these names, the history, 
living members, etc., please e-mail me directly.

Good gentles all:
    It's not Lord Justin's fault.  He sent us the Rolls in early December,
but we got distracted by various things and so have sat on them since then.
Here they are, current as of 6 December ASxxiiii -- 1989 CE -- and we
apologize for the delay.

    SCA-REQUEST@MC.SCA.MIT.EDU 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

			The Rolls Ethereal
			------------------

Well, it's only three months late -- here's the new edition of the Rolls
Ethereal! (And we'll see if I can be a tad more timely with the next
issue.) The Rolls are intended to be a sort of "phone book" for SCAdians 
on the Net, at least those who are interested in being in it. Anyone who 
considers themselves SCAdian, and who has some sort of Use/ARPA/Inter/BIT/
etcNet access is welcome to send in an entry for inclusion. The definition
of "the Net" is broadening quickly; Compuserve and MCImail have recently
added themselves on, and more services are joining every month, it seems...

The SCAnet
----------

Just in case a copy of this falls into the hands of someone who doesn't
already know about it, the SCAnet, as I refer to it here, is the amalgam
of a Usenet newsgroup and an Internet mailing list. Those on Usenet who
are interested can subscribe to the newsgroup "rec.org.sca"; those on Internet
should write to: sca-request@mc.lcs.mit.edu to request a subscription.
Note that these are redundant; things posted to the one should make their
way onto the other pretty quickly. In SCAspeak, the SCAnet is generally
known as The Rialto, the marketplace where we all gather and chat.

How to get into these Rolls
---------------------------

Those who want to be listed should send the following information to the
Editor of the Rolls (currently Justin du Coeur, uunet!inmet!justin or
inmet!justin@uunet.uu.net):

1) SCA Name
2) Mundane Name
3) SCA location (eg, Kingdom & Barony/Shire)
4) Mundane location (eg, city and state)
5) Titles & offices, if any
6) Interests
7) Net address

Some comments on the fields:

-- The only information that *must* be sent for inclusion is an SCA or
   Mundane name, and Net address. All other fields are optional (most
   people supply them, but for the privacy concious...) If you don't
   have an SCA name yet, but consider yourself a SCAdian, that's fine;
   just say so, and send an update as soon as you come up with an
   SCA name; in the meantime, you'll be listed under the Mundane name.

-- Please keep the data short. There is only one line available for Titles
   & Offices. If you have been in the Society for twenty years, and have
   accumulated dozens of titles, you can probably consider yourself an
   honored member of the Order of the Etc. Titles or Offices that you are
   particularly proud of should be listed *first*; if I have to trim the
   line, I give preference to things in the front. Likewise, there is
   only one line for Interests. If you are a Jack of All Trades, just say
   so. Particular interests should be listed first.

-- Don't make too many assumptions about my knowledge. Even if everyone
   in the Kingdom of New Oz knows and respects the Order of the Hippo as
   the highest award around, it's quite possible that I've never heard of
   it, so *don't* abbreviate it to "OHip" without explaining what that
   means.

-- Mundane location does not mean full street address. It is simply
   intended as a general locator, so that people can figure out literally
   where you're coming from. It isn't very obvious on the Net, and not
   everyone is proficient in converting SCA geography to Mundane.

-- For the Net address, Inter/ARPANet format (mumble@foobar.site.domain)
   is *strongly* preferred; this is fast becoming a world-wide standard,
   and is a lot more compact than giving the entire linkage tree from the
   backbone. If you *must* give a bang-address (...x!y!foobar!mumble),
   choose *one* best path, and list that. Again, I'm trying to keep this
   down to one line (thus saving me some typing). Also, remember to
   specify which Net you're on; "mumble@foobar" could be Usenet, BITNET,
   or an abbreviated Internet address.

Also, note that, if you want to be included, be sure to send this information
to *me*. If it is sent to sca-request, it may or may not get in, and if it is
sent to The Rialto, it almost certainly won't. This applies to changes just
as much as to new entries; if you want your changes reflected in the Rolls,
be sure to tell me.

Format of the List
------------------

After giving some thought to the matter, I concluded that there is really
*no* common standard formatter for the Net. Therefore this file is flat
ASCII. The only liberty that I have taken is form-feeds (^L) between
sections. You may format it to your heart's desire (for Unix users, the
simplest thing to do is just say, "pr ethrolls | lpr" (assuming you've
saved this post to the file "ethrolls"); this will give you a perfectly
readable, if not fancy, output). If you decide to port this to some 
fancy formatter like troff or Postscript, I suggest making it available
to the public by announcing to the SCAnet that you're willing to mail
it to people. DO NOT re-post the newly-formatted version to the list;
having a dozen versions of the Rolls posted in two weeks would be a
*very* good way to get us in dutch with the administrators of Usenet,
as well as those at mc.lcs.mit.edu.

The format of a typical entry (I use myself as an example), is:

Justin du Coeur ( Mark Waks )
  Barony of Carolingia, East ( Boston, MA )
  Baronial Dancemaster, Keeper of these Rolls
  Dance, archery, dance, autocratting, dance
  uunet!inmet!justin

The first line is my names, with the Mundane in parentheses. The second is
location, also with the Mundane in parens. Third is Titles and Offices,
fourth is Interests, and Fifth is Net address. Entries are in alphabetical
order by *SCA* name; those with no SCA name are in order by Mundane name
at the beginning. If I do not have Location, Titles, or Interests, those lines
will be left out, so don't be surprised if many entries have only three
or four lines. If I got my formatting software right, everything should
fit neatly into eighty columns; no margins are allowed for.

Multiple Entries
----------------

I have received a number of "care of" entries for the Rolls, where someone
not on the Net is receiving e-mail via someone who is. At the moment, I
am still accepting these, but I ask that this not be abused. *Don't*
send your entire group's names for entry under your address. It's fine
(for now, at least) to send your spouse's or Seneschal's entry c/o you,
but try to keep it down. The Rolls are getting quite large, and if this
gets abused too much, I'll have to cut out c/o entries entirely.

Likewise, I have received several "lists" of people on the Net, where one
member of a group sends information for everyone remotely connected to
the group. I believe that a lot of the members so listed are rather
peripheral, in the SCA or the Net or both. Therefore, I ask that people
send their own entries to me. It's fine to send information for a close
friend while you're doing your own, but any message containing more than
three entries risks being thrown out entirely. I'm sorry I have to do this,
but the only way that I can tell that someone actually cares about having
an entry is having them send it themselves, and it's no fun at all entering
the data for twenty people, suspecting that most of them aren't even active
SCAdians...

Accuracy
--------

There are no warrantees, express or implied, on this information. I'm 
printing it as I got it, this edition, and have made no attempts to
confirm that the Net addresses are currently valid. If your information
is incorrect, or you know *for sure* that someone else's is, send a
correction to me (inmet!justin@uunet.uu.net).

Copyright
---------

Some people on the Usenet are getting a bit picky about this, so let's
make it explicit:

The Rolls Ethereal are Public Domain. You may print it, cut it up, remail
it, or what have you, freely and with no obligation.

Abbreviations
-------------

In most cases, I have spelled out awards and titles fully. However, there
are some titles that are either a) so common, or b) so long, that I felt
it best to abbreviate them. I have probably not been consistent in when
I abbreviate and when I spell out; forgive me if this troubles you at all.
One or two group names are also abbreviated, for the same reasons as awards.
The following are (I think) all of the abbreviations used in this book
(Except for the few where someone did send me something indecipherable,
like "OHip"). I have provided brief explainations, where I know them.
Anyone with a more authoritative knowledge of what awards are for, please
pass it on to me...

AH!  Thaa-aaat's eeasy!

(And anybody seeing the next EK ILOI will understand why I think this
one is easy...)

The term you want is "pile", and in this case "3 piles".  However
according to this book I have in front of me (_A_Dictionary_Of_Heraldry_
by Stephen Friar, a highly recommended book for people interested
in heraldry) the use of "pile" has changed a bit over the centuries.
In medieval times the piles would have met at a point in the base,
and is a very striking design.  (Obviously I like it since I used
3 piles conjoined en point like that on my device)

Later the piles began to be as you've drawn yours, with the piles
not meeting anywhere and only going a little way down the shield.
THe terminology "conjoined en point" was developed around that
time to describe the style of piles I used in my device.

Unto the Rialto, greetings!

Lord Justin asks about events at or near Dayton on the weekends of
January 20 or 27. Digging out the recent Pale shows that the Flaming
Gryphon baronial Twelfth Night is on the 20th (not a real event) and
that Sternfeld (Indianapolis, IN) is having an Archery Event on the
27th. Indianapolis is about a 2 hour drive from Dayton (at least it
is for *me*.) The Autocrats are Lords Valadar and Arundel, farspeaker

From: "S. Gwen Johnson" <sgj@ctj.paladin.aberdeen.md.us>
To: SCA@mc.lcs.mit.edu
Subject: Shakespeare

I have participated in, seen and heard about an awful lot of different
Shakespeare productions, but I must confess that the description of the circus
set with rings and swings and things takes the cake.  Was this production
really good Shakespeare, or was it just a novel and unusual way of staging a
play everyone has seen too many times before?  I have a hard time imagining a
performance done this way in which the stage effects do not overwhelm the play.

After four hundred years, Shakespeare has been done and done to death.  I
understand the urge to try different ways of staging the plays, and feelt eh
most successful ones have been those that used costumes (and sometimes adapted
the language) of another place and time.  Akira Kurosawa is very gfood at
translating Shakespeare into the Japanese idiom.  I've also seen and heard
about other productions...a Romeo and Juliet done in American Civil WAr
uniforms, for example.  I haven't seen this one, but my friend who saw it said
it made the feud between the two families much more comprehensible to him. That
seems to me like a good goal.  

Many productions seem to be just trying to do something wierd and bizarre to
get attention.  this doesn't strike me as useful.  Other productions that try
new interpretations are trying to expand Shakespeare's work, to show how his
tales are universal tales.  Others are tryign to render the tales into a
vernacular that can be understood by modern men.  That is perhaps the saddest
thing, that Shakespeare has become "high brow" stuff that only eggheads can
understand.  The average man puts Shakespeare right up there next to opera as a
cultivated taste irrelevant and incomprehensible to ordianry life.  And yet
once upon a time, opera was also a great public spectacle and all the little
towns in America had their opera houses.  What has happened to take these great
art forms away fromt he massed public for whom they were intended and isolate
them as the property of the educated classes?

And as for my opinion on the true authorship of Shakespeare's plays, well, I
think that debate only arose after Shakespeare had been adopted as the property
of the intelligentsia.  Literature was highly valued by the Elizabethans, and
the writing of sonnets was pretty routine.  Teh average educated man today
would be pretty hard pressed to knock out a sonnet, but in  
Shakespeare's day such writing skills were valued, and more widespread. The
idea athat Shakespeare's plays could only have been written by a upper class,
well educated man smacks of intellectual snobbery that assumes skills and
talents belong only to the rich and well bred.  

There is plenty of other evidence that Shakespeare did indeed exist and write
on demand.  he is one of the translators of the King James Bible.  He has
written numerous pieces in addition to the plays.  The sonnets are quite
voluminous, and there are odds and ends of other poieces as well.  I think it
would be awfully hard for somebody to keep up such a deceit as multiple joint
authorship for the period of years in which Shakespeare lived and wrote.  And
why would anybody want to?  Each of the men proposed as the "real" Shakespeare
was a prominent writer in his own right.  Why would he not want to get credit
for everything he wrote?  Writers *like* to be recognized for theri work.

Occassionally writers choose alernate identities because they want to protect
theri personal lives.  James Tiptree JR, who was really a woman, come to mind,
as do other nom de plume.  I find it conceivable that one person who did not
want public acclaim took on a nom de plume to write the works, but not really.
After all, Shakespeare was friendly with a number of people, had students and a
theatere company, and got married.  He seems to have been pretty public and
accessible.  Another thing that is pretty convincing is that Shakespeare got
his father knighted, and so in one fell swoop became second generation
nobility.  Now if the person who wrote the plays and sonnets wasn't really
Shakespeare, why did he get Shakespeare's father knighted?

Yours in Service.

Administrivia:

Congratulations!  We're the lucky winners in the lottery to choose the
lucky victim, er, test case for the new improved automatic digestifier,
which has just been finished by the small but dedicated cadre of ITS
hackers.  This change should if anything improve the situation for
list members.  Specific differences you may notice:

All messages included in the digest will now include all the To: and CC:
fields they arrived here with.  So if a message was sent to some particular
list member but cc'd to the whole list, or sent to several lists, that will
now be obvious.  For those of us who use undigestifying or digest-bursting
tools, this change will have the beneficial effect of causing each message
burst from the digest to automatically have a legal mail header.

There are now rules governing the maximum size of digests sent out.  If
there is too much accumulated mail, the digestifier will send out the
oldest section as the digest and save the newest section for later.
Conversely, the digestifier also has the ability to produce more than one
digest a day.  The effect of this change is that list members whose sites
have difficulty swallowing very large mail should no longer run into that
problem; on the other hand, if the discussion grows extensive, it will get
throughput in efficient chunks.

The digestifier will now check each included message for lines that begin
with lots of dashes.  Such lines are created by the digestifier to separate
messages from each other, so similar lines inside any message have the
potential to confuse digest-bursting tools.  To guard against this problem,
the digestifier will now change the initial dash of any such lines inside
messages to a space.

If this change causes any problems, please report them to us.

three isoceles triangles coming down from the top of the shield
so that the bases touch and file the width and the points are 1/3 of
the way down the shield?
like    ____________
        \  /\  /\  /
         \/  \/  \/  and then another 2/3 of the shield.  I'm really
stumped on this one.

Also, I find I can't keep from saying this - Mistress Niccola, your
helpful hints grate intensely on this beginner at least.  You are
presenting your opinion as the truth, and it is very annoying.  The
subject of what SCA arts are for, and the emotional approach to them,
are after all matters of diverse opinion.

Subject: Events near Dayton?

Greetings all! A question for a friend: are there going to be any events
near Dayton, Ohio (say, within two hours) on Jan 20 or 27? She's going to
be out there on a business trip, and is hoping to get out to a Midrealm
event while she's there...

This, of course, raises the interesting point that Ragnar's list should
probably include mundane locations, as well as SCAdian ones. I went to
use the list, to see if there was anyone to ask, and realized that I have
no idea of the mapping of SCA location to mundane outside of the East. Of
course, that isn't *precisely* what the list is for, but it would still
probably be a good idea...

Subject: Hamlet

I can't say I have any particular favorite movie version of Shakespeare, mostly
because I feel stage plays are not usually transferred very well to film.  They
all tend to look as if someone just photographed a play that was performed
without an audience.  Therefore my favorite versions have been stage
productions I've seen at the Festival in Stratford Ontario.  I even had the
pleasure of meeting and knowing some of the people who worked there-actors, a
fight choreographer, a seamstress...(The fight choreographer fights in SCA.
Beautiful to watch, but he always loses....what's pretty for the audience isn't
always the most effective in combat)

Probably the thing I enjoyed more than any other was their production of The
Merry Wives of Windsor.  I was in stitches for three acts.  I *hurt* I laughed
so much.  


But my favorite play is Hamlet.  And I am so-ooooo tired of all the weasly
interpretations of Hamlet's character.  Are we such a violent society that we
expect a mature, moral man to rush out and murder soembody with no proof except
the word of a ghost?  Would YOU murder somebody for that reason?  Heck no.
Murder is murder, and you better have a darn good reason.  Spirits wafting up
therough the ground do not comprise good evidence, and never have in an English
court of law.  All of Hamlet is about the search for evidence and the creating
of good reason to carry out an act of vigilanteism.

Hamlet himslef is not the wishy washy character he is usually protrayed as.
For one thing,  he's a man thrity years old, as attested byt he grave-diggers.
Second, he is the best swordsman in Denmark (which is the big reason Laertes,
the number two swordsman in Denmark is so jealous and hostile to him).  He is a
man with iron nerve.  Think about it.  On the trip to England he snuck into
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's cabin while they were sleeping, rifled their
belongings, made off with the edict, took it to his cabin, read it, forged it,
and snuck it back into their stateroom.  When assaulted by pirates he lead the
defense so vigorously that he pursued the villains over the rail and back onto
their own deck--where he was abandoned by his own people who cut the cables.
IUn honor of his courage, the pirates let him live and set him ashore, which is
how he got back to Denmark.  In the final act this courageous, proud man is
stung to duel Laertes by Laerteas taunts about his skill and courage.  This is
not the story of a weak willed, overly sensitive "sweet prince" so many
productions portray him as.

This is the story of a man deprived of his crown, motivated  by pride and
virtue, to set right a wrong for which he has no proof. In the first scene
Hamlet is depressed and slovenly.  He's just lost his beloved father and had
his mother marry an unfavorite uncle.  This is not a particularly happy state
of affairs, but all the characters are at great pains to let us know how
unusual this is.  They remark on such things as him abandoning fencing
practice, to which he was so dedicated, and avoiding his friends, and so forth.
The ghost rouses him from his depression and calls him to action.  But if
murder was done, then an alert, active Hamlet is not going to be appreciated
byt he murderer.  And so Hamlet continues to pretend to be depressed and
apathetic.  Claudius notices and difference, and starts spying  on Hamlet.  We
then have a game of cat and mouse in which neither party has, but is trying to
accumulate evidence against the other.  This is suspenseful!  The prize in this
game is the crown of Denmark, something defintely worth conniving for.  

Anyhow, that's why I like Hamlet.  I think it is full of subtlety that is not
apparent in his other works.  It has multiple interpretations of character and
motive that make it a fascinating twisted tale of personalities.  Most of
Shakespeare's other works are pretty straigth forward about who's doing
what and why.


Shakespeare based his story of Hamlet on an older Danish tale about Amleth.
I've never been able to find a copy of this story and I wonder if anyone could
tell me where to find it.

Greetings!

I'd like begin this posting by commenting on/replying to Rev. Mom's posting
(which I greatly enjoyed reading, btw).

This is the production originally staged at the Brooklyn College of Music, and 
to which I referred in an earlier posting.  It had to be seen to be believed!! 
Soliliquoys delivered while swinging and hanging from trapezes; the white-box 
stage surrounded on it's "edges" by matte black catwalks, which were the 
province of the fairies... wild!

One of the big 3 networks broadcast this at the time, and is another of the 
performances I referred to originally.  A blast to watch!

YES!YES!YES!  Broadcast on A&E and/or PBS (they often share and co-produce;
had you noticed?); staged at Lincoln Center.  I am *absolutely* convinced that 
Shakespeare himself, were he alive today, would have loved their inventive 
presentation!

Absolutely agreed!  Y'know, I really do wish PBS would run "The Shakespeare 
Plays" again (at least locally...).

>*versions* of Shakespeare, not the real thing.  Judge it on its

Again, agreed.  However, I think it should be noted that this in no way 
detracts from the films in any way.  RAN is a masterpiece, IMHO, in its own 
right.  But then, I like Kurosawa!

I, too, think Shakespeare is the sole and true author of the plays.  And my 
pet-peeve type of "no he didn't" rationale is the one which holds that 
Shakespeare was too provincial and/or uneducated and/or uncouth to have either
the background knowledge (for writing such plays as "Julius Caesar" or "Romeo 
& Juliet") or the insight into the human condition the plays display to have 
been capable of writing them.  Puh-leese!  Many of Shakespeare's sources are 
well-known.  As for the other:  the phrase "he's a natural _____" comes to 
mind.
 

ARVAL'S BLAZON:  Master Jed Silverstar, here in Trimaris, has a very similar
compass on his arms.  His blazon is:  "Azure, a compass argent, the principal 
points couped."  In this instance, the "saltire ends" extend to the edge of 
the field, while the "cross ends"  (the principal compass points:  north, 
south, east, and west) are couped.  So, in this case we have at least "a 
compass couped, the principal points ?????"  Is there such a thing as "double-
couped"?  (Frankly, I don't have the time this week to pull out the
Fox-Davies, _et al._, and figure it out.) 

KNIGHTING AGE:  The youngest I've heard of is 18 years old, and I've heard of 
several at that age.  The implied attitude I've picked up is that people are 
reluctant to elevate someone to the peerage who is yet in their minority.

Subject: Shakespeare

One Shakespeare production I'd dearly love to see (if it's available) is
the Shakespeare in the Park version of The Taming of the Shrew with Raul
Julia as Petruchio and Meryl Streep as Kate.  PBS broadcast a special on
this production many years ago that featured scenes from the production
intersperced with interview with the actors that were done backstage
during the course of the performance.  Is a tape of either the special
or the entire play available?

As for the BBC Shakespeare plays, it was my considered opinion that in
general the comedys were wretched because they threw all notion of
pacing out the window.  (My preference for Shakespeare comedys is for a
very fast paced, sparkly production.  Most of the comedys are very
funny, but a great deal of the humor depends on the energy and pacing of
the performance.   Let them slow down and you lose both.. [Note:
previous comments do not necessarily apply to "comedys" such as The
Winter's Tale, which is only a comedy because it has a happy ending..]) 
On the other hand, the slower, more considered pace worked wonderfully
for the history plays [I must have watched Richard II at least 10
times...] because it allowed the audience time to digest what was
happening to the characters, as well as why it was happening..  All
IMHO, of course..

The problem with this emblazon is that a mullet is quite clearly a star,

There may also be a better emblazon (can you think of one Arval)

Subject: Dyes and Patterns

Greetings from Calafia>Caid

Concerning Pat's questions yesterday;

A friend of mine (without access to Rialto) is active in the research
of period dyes and wool preparation (spinning and weaving).
She recommends as *the* primary source for dying info the
booklet in the 'Creative Anachronist' series (either #38 or
#41, she can't find it), which gives excellent information on
not only what herbs and plants produce what colors, but onto
which fabrics they work best. This series should be readily
available from your local arts officer or seneschal.

As far as patterns for period clothes go, I recommend going
to the library (even a small extension library is usually
fine) and searching through the section on 'Costumes'. You
should be able to find at least five or six good picture
books on pre-1400's clothing. Patterns are a bit more
difficult to come by, and as my wife does all of our
costuming sans pattern, I can't help you much there.
For some good pattern ideas that I've heard about, check out
the 'Known World Handbook'. It's about $8.00 and is great fun
as well as very informative.

Have fun on your project.

Subject: student bloopers

  As a teacher of sixteen and seventeen year olds, I often see a great deal of
ignorance.  Furthermore, my students are all disadvantaged students who were
unable to succeed in the traditional classroom setting.  Many of them are
juvenile delinquents.  My job, and the job or the school I work for is to equip
these students with basic education skills and job skills so that they will be
able to support themselves instead of becoming hardened criminals or perpetual
welfare cases.  Student bloopers are amusing, but after watching students with
first grade readin levels buckle down and crawl there way through a text book
and pass their tests with great effort, it its ivery funny.  

I answer questions that are quite shocking in the ignorance of the world.  I
have answered simple questions such as: What's a sawhorse?  And I have
corrected a student who misunderstood a diagram.  In the picture shown, the
light colored car had the right of way at the interesection.  The student
assumed that this 2was a  rule of the road, that light colored cars always hav
ethe right of way.  

I have watched students set themselves up to fail, and defend themselves in
advance of failing because they expect to fail.  When I get a student to
completion it is a great source of satisfaction to me.  I have inadequate
materials and the students all have discipline problems, but in my classroom
students learn things.  It is useless to laugh at the errors of students who
don't know better and should.

I am always very careful not to express humor at my students ocassionally
outrageous reasoning and always squash the ridicule that the students are quick
to heap on one another.

Why do so many students do so poorly?  And why in particular  do so many poor
students and minority students do so poorly?  It's a complicated question, but
I think the underlying cause is that we don't respect and value our children.
This leads to a whole host of social and famial problems that handicap school
age children.  Inadequate foopd and shelter lead to learning disabilities.  No
universal health care, and an emphasis on cure instead of prevention means that
many young shildren are not protected from diseases and accidents that could be
prevented.  Alcohol abuse, drug abuse, lead paint, poor nutrtion, pollution,
and many other contaminats in the enviroments, especially the big city
enviroment, contribute to health problems in children.   I have seen estimates
that claim 50,000 children a year would live instead of sying if all lead was
from gasoline.  Lead in paint is present int he homes of 55% of young
children living in major metropolitan areas.  Lead causes mental defects.  It
is theorized as one of the causes of the fall of Rome--since lead is sweet
tasting, Romans used it asl flavoring.  And since it is sweet tasting, modern
children eat paint chips.  

In Europe, daycare is routine and affordable.  France pays women to have
children and to stay home and take care of them.  Italy subsidizes daycare to
let women go to work.  Sweden ahas generous parental leave policies so that
both parents may stay home to take care of a new born infant.  Europe has a
different attitude about amny other matters affecting society as a whole.
Drugs and prostitutuion are considred a health care issue, not a criminal
issue.  Americans on the average have a higher standard of living when material
goods are measured, but Americans are far behind the rest of the industrial
world in social necessities such as education and child care.  There are Sourh
American countries with better literacy rates than the United states.

This is an issue that ought to concern SCA.  We are an educational organization
that claims to be availible to anyone.  Yet I have seen few  minority members
in the SCA, and I have never been part of a demo or even heard of a demo taking
place in a lower income school, and i have been a member of the SCA for almost
thirteen years now.  SCA is conposed dominantly of middle and upper middle
class white people with at least some degree of college education, and the
people we give demos to are people who resemble us.  I think most of the people
I know in the SCA would be nervous at the very least to come into the school
wear I work and give a demo.  Nonetheless, as my part in battling ignorance,
when school returns to session I will approach the history teachers and see if
they are interested in having a SCA demo.  I hope that other people will do the
same.  We must make a deliberate effort to educate all people, not just the
comfortable, convenient people.

Subject: Ibn Fadlan rides again

Greetings from William de Corbie!

Some time ago, a couple of texts by Ibn Fadlan appeared on the net.
Subsequently, the accuracy of the translation (by Michael Crichton) was
questioned by others. (Sorry, I don't remember who posted any of this.)
I have now found a complete Swedish translation of Ibn Fadlan's writings,
containing two different versions (the longest Arabic one plus Amin Razi's
version). It is by Stig Wikander and looks like a quite serious,
scholarly work.

At a cursory look, I have found no serious discrepancies between this
version and the one I have seen on the net earlier. Perhaps Crichton was
not as diligent i details as he might have been, but his version gives
the gist of the story. 

Below here I will quote some of the historical-biographical notes about
the text. Later, I *might* translate the whole thing into English.
However, I am uncertain about copyright here - even these quotes below
may be a violation... The book also contains texts by Al-Ghazal (a Moor
who went to Scandinavia around 845) and Abu Hamid (another Moor who
travelled extensively, though not in the North).

--- here follows some data from Wikander's book ---

Ahmad ibn Fadlan ibn al-Abbas ibn Rashid ibn Muhammed, mostly known
as simply Ibn Fadlan, is totally unknown except for what he tells of
himself in the journal of his travels. We don't know the years of his
birth or death, nor do we know his profession. It seems he had some
thelolgical education and that he was held in some regard at court,
since he was trusted with a diplomatic mission to the Turkish peoples
- but it is possible that he exaggerates his own importance.

Nevertheless, he was an acute observer, and his story has been quoted
by many other authors. In the 12th century his tale of the funeral
customs among the norsemen in Rus was quoted in Persian by a certain
Nadjib Hamadhani, also known as Ahmad Tusi or Muhammed ibn Mahmud ibn
Ahmad Tusi, in his book "Adjaib al-Machlukat", or "The Wonders of
Creation". This is one of those collections of amusing anecdotes and
fantastic stories that were so popular in the middle ages. In a later
copy of this book, from the 14th century, we also find illustrations.

Another Arab, the geographer Jakut (1178-1229) from Bagdad, has several
more quotes from Ibn Fadlan in his geographical dictionary Mudjam al-
Buldan. Jakut says that Ibn Fadlan describes the whole of his journey
back to Bagdad. But the last part has not been preserved anywhere. A
somewhat better and in some parts more complete version of the text was
found in 1923 in a mosque in Mesched (northern Iran). And finally, the
part about the people in Rus is preserved in an Iranian encyclopaedia by
Amin Razi, written in India around 1600.

A comparison between these texts show that none of them is complete or
original. We only have excerpts and accounts of Ibn Fadlan's writings.
The Arabic text is rather different from the Persian ones. Jakut has
added some material of his own.

In discussing the SCA with folks at work, a question came up I don't
recall ever considering before - the chronological age of people at
knighting.  What do you know about it?  Who was youngest at the
time of their knighting, and who was oldest?  Any ideas as to mean
and average?  And for the question I have considered:  how long had
they been in the SCA, and how long fighting?

I'll summarize if you want to mail to me instead of posting, but
traffic has been slow enough lately we could probably keep this on
the net without a problem.

  In SCA digest 569 Felan shena Thoron'edras suggested adding "Inscribed

whose beautiful work this was.  This sounds like a fine idea.
  I have a wonderful scroll done by Katerina von Halstern (modulo spelling)
that uses a different sort of signature that I think is very clever and pretty.
She draws a tiny delicate boar's head on the front of each of her scrolls.
Once you know her mark, it says as plain as words "Katerina made me".

Many (most?) scribes in the East use maker's marks.  I think putting the name
on the back of the scroll is still a good idea, because most people won't
know the mark of a particular scribe, but it's a little touch that we add
anyway.  (Other scribes will often know, even if no one else does.)  The
list of marks for current scribes was published in the scribes' newsletter
a couple of years ago; it probably ought to be updated sometime soon.

Subject: Crosses and signatures and stuff

Greetings, all, from Ariel.

Arval's graphic looked a lot to me like the flag of England: a Saint Andrew's
cross and a Saint George's cross.  Perhaps it was meant to be two crosses,
rather than a cross and a saltire?

Felan asked about how scribes sign their names.  The answer: any way they want
to!  Many of us use maker's marks on the front of the scroll, or write our
names in tiny letters.  Some also sign the scrolls on the back.  (I have the
good fortune these days to be making scrolls for people I know, so my name
suffices.  I know one scribe who pastes an address label on the back of each
scroll he does.)  Maker's marks don't do the recipient much good unless the
recipent knows the scribe, or knows scribes who recognize the marks.  (Mine
is pretty easy: a crescent moon and a bunch of grapes.)  This is why I exhort
people to sign their scrolls as well.

The other period thing a scribe can do is create a colophon for each scroll
and put it on the front or the back.  My dear cousin Dorothea of Caer-Myrddin
helped me put together a wonderful, period colophon in Latin , which I intend
to use on my next scroll.  If you don't want to go to all that trouble, you
can always just write "So-and-so me fecit" (So-and-so made me") on the back of
the scroll with pencil.

A good example of a period colophon is "Platignum the Ink-Stained made this
during the reign of King Panzer and Queen Bimbelina, on the Feast of Saint
Robert, this 4th day of January, AS 24."  You can add more, of course... as
did the scribe who added "...da Christo mihi potem" (for Christ's sake give
me a drink) at the end of his work.  Other scribes remarked at the hairiness
of the parchment, or how they'd rather be doing something else, or whatever.

I have never yet received a thank-you note for a scroll, but I've been getting
something better: The recipient comes and finds me and thanks me.  All the
recipient's friends come seek me out and tell me what an awesome thing it is.
Sometimes people I don't even know will corner me at an event and sing that
scroll's praises.  This is the kind of stuff that makes a difference, knowing
that the work I did really mattered to the person receiving it.

Do something good for your Kingdom today: feed coffee to a scribe.

Yours for the ink-stained wretches,

First of all, when I was talking about commercial frames, I was talking both
about preassembled ones (and there are some good ones) and about frames
as you can have made from a custom frame shop.  I have a good friend of mine
who is a professional framer, and I've heard her swear a lot about those
wax seals.  Even custom framing is grooved to keep the glass fairly close
to the picture, allowing for matting, and it still is not enough to 
accomodate most of those wax seals.  Deep museum framing is possible but
would be prohibitively costly for many people.
  
I just think that people who want seals should have them, but people like
me who don't should not have to have them.  I can't afford museum framing.

Ah.  My Cousin Ariel, also of Caer-Myrddin, is working on an article

find them at the moment, but maybe Ariel can post a precis for general

The recipe given by William de Corbie for Glogg looks a little strange to me.
All the recipes I have see are based on aquavit, not vodka or brandy.
The caraway flavor is (to my mind) an important addition.
Don't use too cheap a red wine--use a decent jug wine.  If you wouldn't drink
the wine by itself, use it for vinegar, not mulled wine or gloegg.
There is a good recipe (for "Profesorn's gloeg") in the old Time-Life
Scandanavian cookbook.

By the way, is there any evidence that gloegg is a period drink?  I know that
people were capable of distilling alcohol, but is this particular hot punch
that old?  It looks a lot like a 18th or 19th century invention to me.

Message-ID:  <9001111621.aa05889@mintaka.lcs.mit.edu>


Since the Helpful Hints originally began to encourage especially those
artisans whose work I hope to see at Ice Dragon this March, I will
finish them up pretty quickly now.  If there's anything you're sure
I've missed on the general topic of how to be a better new-medieval
craftsman, now's the time to squawk.  Write me c/o Lord Thomas Lake at
<mtg@cornellc.cit.cornell.edu>.  But, for this week:

DON'T BASE YOUR WORK ON FREAKS

Sooner or later you're going to see a real medieval piece that you've
got to have a copy of.  You're going to do your research, look up all
the related items you can find, search out contemporary illustrations-
and discover that your pet project is a freak.  It was a bastard kluge
made by a mongrel craftsman in a foreign land.  But you love it.  OK,
make it.  Once in your life, you can waste your time on a whim.

The rest of the time, though, you should spend your energies on
projects which advance your craftsmanship and benefit your
understanding.  Your goal is to develop the skills and knowledge that
enable you to think and work like a medieval craftsman.  The path to
that goal is to copy real medieval pieces thoughtfully and the best
plan is to copy everyday, mainstream, medieval objects.

In the first place, it's easier to find out a lot about mainstream
pieces.  There may not be many 3-legged medieval stools in museums, but
there are hundreds of contemporary illustrations of them.

In the second place, the mainstream is the best training ground for
your hands and your mind.  The characteristic forms of a calligraphic
hand are those used in the thousands of documents produced for routine
purposes.  The quirky, specially nice piece written by the best scribe
in France for the king may show you the pinnacle of the art, but it is
not the hand that scribe wrote as a beginner.  There is no reason for
another beginner to use it either.

Even worse are those pieces that were just plain weird at the time they
were made.  Look at them for what they can teach you, admire them as
great works of fantasy,, but don't copy them.

It is a fact, sad but true, that the pieces on display in museums do
not necessarily represent the mainstream.  Often they are the very
nice, very decorative, very expensive pieces that were tenderly cared
for and stored while the average pieces were being kicked around,
broken, and discarded.  You have to look to the archeological reports
and contemporary illustrations.  The good news is that the average,
boring pieces described in the archeological reports are often damaged,
so you can examine their structure.  If you're really lucky, they were
made by a middling craftsman working as fast as he could and telling
details of construction will be apparent- details that are covered up
or cleaned up in "nicer" pieces.

Take heart.  If you choose to make the mainstream pieces, it will be
easier, cheaper, and faster than making the deluxe pieces.  The Maestro
has just finished a copy of some pieces of the Roggendorf armor- the
16th century "puffed and slashed" costume harness you have probably
seen pictures of.  He says that he would really rather have made three
munitions-grade armors of the same period in that time, because he
would have learned more about the fit and proportion of armor of that
period.  Take the opportunity to finish a fairly simple project and get
onto the next one to use what you've learned.  Make the chair that Jack
Average Medieval had in his house and stop dreaming about the throne of
France.  Time for that when you've developed the skills you need to
make it easily and with pleasure.

There is a temptation to make the piece which is exciting, unusual,
unique, freakish.  It's bound to attract attention.  It may, by
accident, be closer to a modern esthetic than its quotidian relatives.
It is special.  If you make it, *you* will be special.  Bullshit.  If
you do your best to make careful, workmanlike, authentic, medieval
pieces you will be unusual enough, and I will be proud to know you.

	Greetings, gentles all, from the sunny shores of Caid;

	I'm replying to Felan shena Thoron'edras' questions

	works with the head scribe within the group to lay out the

	personallize every scroll's wording and layout),
	then she hands it over to a talented calligrapher, and
	when it is returned she then goes to work on the painting. In
	all, by the time the scroll is completed at least three
	people have worked on it.  Each then signs the *front* with
	at least an emblem (the head of the group is 'Fletcher', and
	hence he uses a very distinctive arrow), if not the full
	name or initials.  Then on the back each one's name is written 
	out so that when the award is given out the herald may read it to
	the assemblage ('...Calliged by..., Illuminated by ...',etc). 
	Anyway, believe me, all of the people who
	work on a scroll have some sort of identifying mark on the
	front in full (though sometimes camouflaged) view. 

	The most interesting thing that I've found reading the
	discussions is the assumption that a scribe does all the work

Just throwing in my two farthing's worth in agreement.  I got my AoA recently, 
and my scroll has just a little tiny squiggle on it which is probably a 
maker's mark, but no-one I've shown it to has recognized it.  If I'd had a 
name to go on, I would have sent my thanks to the scribe.  So for all you 
scribes out there, put a name on your work!  Yes, most people won't think to 
thank you, but don't make it harder than it has to be for the rest of us!

I don't think this would be appropriate.  On the other hand, it has
become traditional in the East for scribes to put a small maker's mark
somewhere on the scroll.  For example: Walter De Witte frets a quill
through a W in the text.  Gabriella Pisano draws a small burnisher
hidden somewhere in the borders.  Dorren of Ashwell uses her badge, a
peacock perched atop a lozenge.  These marks are generally very small,
and unobtrusive.  Since I know they are there, I look for them, and
often point them out to the recipient of the scroll.

Well, absolutely favorite is the HAMLET I saw at Stratford, which

babble on about that and Jacobi's Richard III and Richard II. :-)
(I spent three months in England on the CIEE/BUNAC program,
working as a typist to support my theatre habit.  I saw 38
productions in all--15 of them Shakespeare.  I'll happily burble
on about it at the drop of a hat.)

>Mine 
>include Nicol Williamson's "MacBeth" and "Hamlet," as well as both Olivier's 
>and Derek Jacobi's "Hamlets".  

I mislike the Olivier HAMLET, simply because I get so tired of
all those panning shots of The Bed, and the whole Jones
Oedipus/incest-complex explanation of Hamlet's hesitation, which
invariably leads to Hamlet kissing Gertrude in the bedroom scene,
and Laertes and Ophelia being a bit touchy-feely for brother and
sister   (grrrrr.).  Excuse.  My prejudices are showing.  :-)

Jacobi's HAMLET is fun to watch, but a little slow.  Still,
seeing Patrick Stewart with curly hair as Claudius is fun.

I prefer the Kozintzev version of HAMLET (tough to find, but with
a great score, and some incredible visuals that develop Olivier's 
work even further.).  Even if "I do think it, my lord." got
translated to "Da."  There's still a clarity and sweeping power
to the visuals and the acting that gets sort of buried under
Olivier's preoccupation with incest in his version.

>love the 30's movie version of "Midsummer Night's Dream" starring Merle 
>Oberon, with Micky Rooney as Puck (*still* my favorite Puck!)  The Royal 
>Shakespeare Company did a really neat version of the same play...  

The RSC's done about twenty really neat versions of that play,
actually.  :-)  Last year they had an exhibit that showed all the
different versions they'd done, as well as Reinhard's numerous
versions.  The Victorian production with Maria Bjornssen (you know, 
PHANTOM OF THE OPERA? :-) costumes and sets was stunning.  But 
the most famous is probably the Peter Brook 1971 production with 
a circus-sortof setting.  (A big white box, with occasional
rings, swings, and a big red feather for Titania's bed.  The
actors dressed in silk clown-suits some of the time, and did
everything from spinning plates to juggling.  Alan Howard was
Oberon, and Ben Kingsley was Demetrius.)

The filmed RSC version is Peter Hall's, and I loved it.  Very
60's, with paisley shirts, done out in the north of England in
September, so it's all very cold and wet and muddy.  Ian
Richardson and Judi Dench cavorted in near nudity, painted green
as Oberon and Titania, and gave performances that all those
Reinhard tinsley fairies could never equal.  Ian Holme was a fantastic
puck, and Diana Rigg and David Warner were great as Helena and
Lysander.  Hippolyta's leather hip boots were a bit much, but
it's a great film.

>What about everybody else?

Well, since you ask.. ;-)

Another version I like a lot is the Joseph Papp MUCH ADO ABOUT
NOTHING that was videotaped, aired, and led to the closing of
the show. <sigh>  EXTREMELY difficult to find.  Sam Waterston's a
great Benedick.  The entire production is set in the era of Teddy
Roosevelt's Roughriders, and the nightwatch became keystone kops.
A really good, thoughtful interpretation.

And for a crazy, good-time, there's nothing to beat the Flying
Karamozov Bros' COMEDY OF ERRORS.  That thing had me rolling on
the floor.

Oliver's KING LEAR is amazing, and with a supporting cast
including John Hurt, Diana Rigg, Leo McKern, David Threlfall and 
Colin Blakely (not to mention Edward Petherbridge as the King of
France), it can't fail, just because you never lose interest even
if Olivier's off-camera.  :-)  [literary tradition has it that
Shakespeare wrote that whole bit with Gloucester's eyes being put
out, etc. so that Burbage could go and take a rest in the tavern
next to the Globe between big rants.  And then had Lear after the
storm appear on stage sleeping, just in case Burbage'd had too much.
:-)]

The Olivier OTHELLO (I forget the director, but it wasn't
Olivier.  It was a film of a National Theatre production) is
notable because Olivier lowered his voice about a fifth, did
a funny accent, his makeup comes off on Maggie Smith (slight, but
if you're looking for it, you can catch it) in one scene, and a
very young Derek Jacobi is Cassio doing a credible imitation of
someone ralfing his wine.  Great stuff.

(Sorry. I took English 117F at UC Berkeley, which was "Shakespeare 
in Film", and we got to see some neat stuff.)

As for pans:

Stay away from the Jeremy Brett MACBETH, and the Timothy
Dalton/Lynn Redgrave ANTONY & CLEOPATRA (unless you're a trekker.
Koenig and Nichols are in it, along with John Carradine, and a
host of other people from diverse careers.)

And even though I like Kurosawa, RAN and THRONE OF BLOOD are
*versions* of Shakespeare, not the real thing.  Judge it on its
own merits, but don't call RAN, KING LEAR or THRONE OF BLOOD,
MACBETH.  And I won't call THE FORBIDDEN PLANET, THE TEMPEST. :-)

Personally, I think he did.  I mean, if it were some conspiracy
by Bacon, Marlowe, et. al, I don't think Jonson would've gotten
quite so pissed at Shakespeare, and given us that wonderful quote
(approx.  My memory's like swiss cheese when it comes to quotes)
about him having that facility of language that flowed so greatly
it was necessary for it sometimes to be stopped.

Yup.  It was great!  I just wish the actress who played Katherine had 
been as good as Cleese.   It's one of the few BBC Shakespeare
productions I really like.  Their TWELFTH NIGHT is another and was 
almost single-handedly saved by Felicity Kendal as Viola.  

Sidenote: The BBC also had Roger Daltry in their COMEDY OF ERRORS.

Actually, English 117T will do their productions wherever they
can get the permission, and whenever they can get the funding.
They did TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA on the steps of Wheeler Hall.
It's a class where you read the play, and then perform it to
understand it better.  They've even done Fletcher and Shakespeare's 
TWO NOBLE KINSMEN.

All the 117T productions are taped and kept down in the basement

Actually,  I think very few of the plays are really one-man plays.
It was mostly a holdover from the Victorian era and the
actor-managers that you got the great-actor-spectacle-connotations.  
Hamlet has four scenes in a row without him showing up once.  Lear 
has a whole subplot with Gloucester, Edmund and Edgar, Macbeth 
has tons of supporting cast,  Richard III is only on stage about 
half the time, and Shylock only appears in (what is it?) five
scenes?.  (sorry. I'm babbling.)

But then with film versions, you *always* have to cut the Bard to 
keep him to a sellable length.  So, all the stuff with Fluellen, and 
the three captains, and the duel between Fluellen and Pistol over the 
leek gets cut down, and you're left with lots of Harry.  

>What I prefer about the Olivier

Definite agreement.  Branaugh's a good visual director, but as an
orator, he doesn't have near the strength, expression, and
versatility that Olivier had.  Branaugh substitutes a lot of
mouth-working and crowd-reaction-shots for honest verbal skill.

The "Once more unto the breach" and St. Crispin's Day speeches
show how wonderful Branaugh is visually, and how general and unspecific
his oratory skills are.  He hollers about the breach, but I had
very little emotional response to the words he was saying.  It
sounded like somebody quoting Shakespeare's line in a shout,
rather than a desperate king trying to get his tired troops to go
and get themselves killed for the greater glory of king and
country.  And I completely missed my favorite line of the St. 
Crispin's speech that Olivier does so well (that part about 
stripping the sleeve and showing the scars).  Branaugh said it, 
I just missed it.

Branaugh doesn't reason you into understanding, he uses a
swelling score, and a louder voice to give a general high pitch
of emotion without form.  A tad annoying.
 
But you've got Ian Holme as Fluellen (and even if the
leek-eating's been taken out, he's still got a great role),
Michael Williams as the soldier Harry talks to and challenges,
(that glove-handing back was a great rewrite/adaptation of the
script.) Judi Dench as Mistress Quickly, Brian Blessed as Exeter (?)
and Derek Jacobi: he of the golden voice :-) for a Chorus.  The 
opening monologue alone was worth the price of the ticket.

Even if Branaugh practically copied the costumes that were used
in his Henry V at the RSC three years ago.  (I'd swear Blessed is
using the same armor :-)

Well, for me, the only time when the Chorus is explicitly "stagy"
is in the first speech.  (Of course, I'm probably wrong) but the rest 
of his function is mostly descriptive, and in film, he can be 
relegated to voice-overs (that's the way Olivier did it, although 
he made the ENTIRE film fade in from stagy to real and back to 
stagy again), the way that asides can become voice-over, and
monologues to-the-camera-speeches.

I preferred having an explicitly present Chorus, but that's
mostly 'cause I like Jacobi.  :-)

Actually, I thought it was Branaugh stepping over his own feet to
*not* do things the way Olivier had done them.  (The simple fact
that "Olivier did it" will cause young British actors to
immediately abandon an idea.  See Antony Sher's YEAR OF THE KING
and the bit about entering the stage, flying.)  Olivier had once
explained his favorite film "discovery"/technique with
Shakespeare: when someone starts yelling, you pull the camera
back.  Branaugh sort of tried to do the opposite by bringing the
camera into extreme closeup whenever somebody whispered.  (I wish
we got to hear his normal voice in the first ten minutes.  The
whispering would've been more effective, then.)

>Zefferelli (modulo spelling).  Yes, the best.

Mild disagreement.  Good, but not the best.  Zefferelli cuts
Shakespeare almost to the bone in his two films.  ROMEO & JULIET
has nearly all of Juliet's big monologues cut by half, completely
removes all references to Rosaline (you know, the girl Romeo was
mooning over and bewailing the loss of her love at the beginning of the
play?), and removes the killing of Paris by Romeo.  In short,
making Romeo a helluva nice guy and a good romantic ideal, rather 
than the semi-homicidal mixed-up complex adolescent he was.  In
my professor's opinion. (OK, so I agree, but I'm not gonna take
the heat. :-)

TAMING OF THE SHREW cuts two minor subplots (the wooing of
Bianca, and the attempt by Tranio to win Baptista over) to 
background during the big chase-scene, and changes verbal skill 
into physical prowess on Petruchio's part.  Good cuts, but sort
of bad for getting a good idea of the text.  Also the wedding
scene was actually shown, while in the play, it's told in a
third-person narrative by Gremio outside the church.  The other
thing I hate (honest, it's the last thing) about SHREW is that
Petruchio always spanks Katherina in that first confrontation.
Pah.  Stage tradition.  Pfui.  By the actual text, there's only
*one* stage direction in that scene and it's "[Katherine strikes
Petruchio]."

Augh.  This is long.  If you sat through all of this, I heartily
thank you, and hope you haven't been too bored by all my ranting.
(except for you, Dani.  You're used to it, and it's all your
fault anyway. :-)

   Greetings....

      While the following posting contains information outside the
 realm of the Society's focus, I think it will be of use to all who
 find scholarly research of our world's history to be their interest.
 Enjoy.


              'The World According to Student Bloopers'
                         by Richard Lederer
                         St. Paul's School
       (Spring 1987, Verbatim, The Language Quarterly, Vol. XIII, No. 4)

     One of the fringe benefits of being an English or History teacher
is receiving the occasional jewel of a student blooper in an essay.  I
have pasted together the following "history" of the world from certi-
fiably genuine student bloopers collected by teachers throughout the
United States, from eighth grade through college level.  Read carefully,
and you will learn a lot.

     The inhabitants of ancient Egypt were called mummies.  They lived
in the Sarah Dessert and traveled by Camelot.  The climate of the Sarah
is such that the inhabitants have to live elsewhere, so certain areas of
the dessert are cultivated by irritation.  The Egyptians built the Pyra-
mids in the shape of a huge triangular cube.  They Pramids are a range
mountains between France and Spain.

     The Bible is full of interesting caricatures.  In the first book of
the Bible, Guinesses, Adam and Eve were created from an apple tree.  One
of their children, Cain. once asked, "Am I my brother's son?"  God asked
Abraham to sacrifice Isaac on Mount Montezuma.  Jacob, son of Isaac,
stole his brother's birth mark.  Jacob was a patriarch who brought up
his twelve sons to be patriarchs. but they did not take to it.  One of
Jacob's sons, Joseph, gave refuse to the Israelites.

     Pharaoh forced the Hebrew slaves to make bread without straw.  Moses
led them to the Red Sea, where they made unleavened bread, which is
bread made without any ingredients.  Afterwards, Moses went up on Mount
Cyanide to get the ten commandments.  David was a Hebrew king skilled at
playing the liar.  He fought with the Philatelists, a race of people who
lived in Biblical times.  Solomon, one of David's sons, had 500 wives
and 500 porcupines.

     Without the Greeks we wouldn't have history.  The Greeks invented
three kinds of columns--Corinthian, Doric, and Ironic.  They also had
myths.  A myth is a female moth.  One myth says that the mother of
Achilles dipped him in the River Stynx until he became intollerable.
Achilles appears in The Illiad, by Homer.  Homer also wrote the Oddity,
in which Penelope was the last hardship that Ulysses endured on his
journey.  Actually, Homer was not written by Homer but by another man of
that name.

     Socrates was a famous Greek teacher who went around giving people
advice.  They killed him.  Socrates died from an overdose of wedlock.

     In the Olympic Games, Greeks ran races, jumped, hurled the biscuits
and threw the java.  The reward to the victor was a coral wreath.  The
government of Athens was democratic because people took the law into
their own hands.  There were no wars in Greece, as the mountains were so
high that they couldn't climb over to see what their neighbors were
doing.  When they fought with the Persians, the Greeks were outnumbered
because the Persians had more men.

     Eventually, the Ramons conquered the Geeks.  History calls people
Romans because they never stayed in one place for very long.  At Roman
banquets, the guests wore garlics in their hair.  Julius Caesar extin-
guished himself on the battlefields of Gaul.  The Ides of March murdered
him because they thought he was going to be made king.  Nero was a cruel
tyranny who would torture his poor subjects by playing the fiddle to
them.

     Then came the Middle Ages.  King Alfred conquered the Dames, King
Arthur lived in the Age of Shivery, King Harold mustarded his troops
before the Battle of Hastings, Joan of Arc was cannonized by Bernard
Shaw, and victims of the Black Death grew boobs on their necks.  Finally
the Magna Carta provided that no free man should be hanged twice for the
same offense.

     In midevil times most of the people were alliterate.  The greatest
writer of the time was Chaucer, who wrote many poems and verses and also
wrote literature.  Another tale tells of William Tell, who shot an arrow
through an apple while standing on his son's head.

     The Renaissance was an age in which more individuals felt the value
of their human being.  Martin Luther was nailed to the church door at
Wittenburg for selling papal indulgences.  He died a horrible death,
being excommunicated by a bull.  It was the painter Donatello's interest
in the female nude that made him the father of the Renaissance.  It was
an age of great inventions and discoveries.  Gutenberg invented the
Bible.  Sir Walter Raleigh is a historical figure because he invented
cigarettes.  Another important invention was the circulation of blood.
Sir Francis Drake circumcised the world with a 100-foot clipper.

     The government of England was a limited mockery.  Henry VIII found
walking difficult because he had an abbess on his knee.  Queen Elizabeth
was the "Virgin Queen."  As a queen she was a success.  When Elizabeth
exposed herself before her troops, they all shouted, "hurrah."  Then her
navy went out and defeated the Spanish Armadillo.

     The greatest writer of the Renaissance was William Shakespear.
Shakespear never made much money and is famous only because of his plays.
He lived at Windsor with his merry wives, writing tragedies, comedies, and
errors.  In one of Shakespear's famous plays, Hamlet rations out his situation
by relieving himself in a long soliloquy.  In another, Lady Macbeth tries to
convince Macbeth to kill the King by attacking his manhood.  Romeo and Juliet
are an example of a heroic couplet.  Writing at the same time as Shakespear
was Miguel Cervantes.  He wrote Donkey Hote.  The next great author was John
Milton.  Milton wrote Paradise Lost.  Then his wife died and he wrote Paradise
Regained.

     During the Renaissance America began.  Christopher Columbus was a great
navigator who discovered America while cursing about the Atlantic.  His ships
were called the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Fe.  Later, the Pilgrims crossed
the Ocean, and this was known as Pilgrims Progress.  When they landed at
Plymouth Rock, they were greeted by the Indians, who came down the hill rolling
their war hoops before them.  The Indian squabs carried porpoises on their
back.  Many of the Indian heroes were killed, along with their cabooses which
proved very fatal to them.  The winter of 1620 was a hard one for the settlers.
Many people died and many babies were born.  Captain John Smith was responsible
for all this.

     One of the causes of the Revolutionary Wars was the English put tacks in
their tea.  Also, the colonists would send their parcels through the post
without stamps.  During the War, the Red Coats and Paul Revere was throwing
balls over stone walls.  The dogs were barking and the peacocks were crowing.
Finally, The colonists won the War and no longer had to pay for taxis.

     Delegates from the original thirteen states formed the Contented Congress.
Thomas Jefferson, a Virgin, and Benjamin Franklin were two singers of the
Declaration of Independence.  Franklin had gone to Boston carrying all his
clothes in his pocket and a loaf of bread under each arm.  He invented elec-
tricity by rubbing cats backwards and declared, "A horse divided against itself
cannot stand."  Franklin died in 1790 and is still dead.

     George Washington married Martha Curtis and in due time became the Father
of Our Country.  Then the Constitution of the United States was adopted to
secure domestic hostility.  Under the Constitution the people enjoyed the right
to keep bare arms.

     Abraham Lincoln became America's greatest Precedent.  Lincoln's mother
died in infancy, and he was born in a log cabin which he built  with his own
hands.  When Lincoln was President, he wore only a tall silk hat.  He said,
"In onion there is strength."  Abraham Lincoln wrote the Gettysburg Address
while traveling from Washington to Gettysburg on the back of an envelope.  He
also freed the slaves by signing the Emasculation Proclamation, and the
Fourteenth Amendment gave the ex-Negroes citizenship.  But the Clue Clux Clan
would torcher and lynch the ex-Negroes and other innocent victims.  It claimed
it represented law and odor.  On the night of April 14, 1865, Lincoln went to
the theater and got shot in his seat by one of the actors in a moving picture
show.  The believed assinator was John Wilkes Booth, a supposingly insane
actor.  This ruined Booth's career.


     Meanwhile in Europe, the enlightenment was a reasonable time.  Voltare
invented electricity and also wrote a book called Candy.  Gravity was invented
by Isaac Walton.  It is chiefly noticeable in the Autumn, when the apples are
falling off the trees.

     Bach was the most famous composer in the world. and so was Handel.  Handel
was half German, half Italian, and half English.  He was very large.  Bach
died from 1750 to the present.  Beethoven wrote music even though he was deaf.
 He was so deaf he wrote loud music.  He took long walks in the forest even
when everyone was calling for him.  Beethoven expired in 1827 and later died
for this.

     France was in a very serious state.  The French Revolution was
accomplished before it happened.  The Marseillaise was the theme song of the
French Revolution, and it catapulted into Napoleon.  During the Napoleonic
Wars, the crowned heads of Europe were trembling in their shoes.  Then the
Spanish gorillas came down from the hills and nipped at Napoleon's
flanks.  Napoleon became ill with bladder problems and was very
tense and unrestrained.  He wanted an heir to inherit his power,
but since Josephine was a baroness, she couldn't bear children.

     The sun never set on the British Empire because the British Empire is in
the East and the sun sets in the West.  Queen Victoria was the longest queen.
She sat on a thorn for 63 years.  Her reclining years and finally the
end of her life were exemplatory of a great of a great personality.  Her
death was the final event which ended her reign.

     The nineteenth century was a time of many great inventions and thoughts.
The invention of the steamboat caused a network of rivers to spring up.  Cyrus
McCormick invented the McCormick raper, which did the work of a hundred men.
Samuel Morse invented a code of telepathy.  Louis Pasteur discovered a cure for
rabbis.  Charles Darwin was a naturalist who wrote the Organ of the Species.
Madman Curie discovered radium.  And Karl Marx became one of the Marx brothers.

     The First World War, caused by the assignation of the Arch-Duck by a surf,
ushered in a new error in the anals of human history.

I've been lurking here for awhile, so I think that this group would be the
most likely to have a solution for my problem.

I'm looking for a pattern for a "Ren Faire" cap - the ones with the small
brim, a crown with a button on top, and usually come with a feather. They're
usually made of velvet, or diamond-shaped pieces of velvet. 

I've searched everywhere I can think of, including several "historical" pattern
makers, and have come up with nothing. Can anyone tell me if this pattern
exists, and if so who makes/sells them? 

Thanks very much for any pointers you can give me.

Oo, oo - DEFINITELY my favorite is John Cleese as Petruchio.  Yes, really,.
Has anyone else seen this one?  It ran as one of the "Shakespeare Plays"
on PBS about 8 years ago.  I love the banquet scene "bru-uck, bruck, bruck
bruck, brk ...."  (chicken clucking).

I first saw this (which is notable for very realistic castle sacking 
scenes and killings, and making MacBeth *drink* the (utterly disgusting
looking) witches potion (and many more than 3 witches, all nude), etc)
in my grade 11 English class.  Since my grade 11 english teacher was
the most utterly typical mousy spinister english teacher you could
ever imagine, we (correctly) concluded that she had no idea what she
had ordered from the Film Board.  It was about a week before she could
get unembarassed enough to discuss the film. (Yes, the utterly uncut
not-for-showing-in-theatres version.) The class thought it was quite
a lot of fun, actually; gory, bloody, and enough occasional nudity to
keep any 16 year old interested! :]

Ah.  Now, the UC Berkeley English Department frequently does small-scale
Shakespeare-in-the-Park productions in Faculty Glade.  Sometime in the late
1970s they did Midsummer Night's Dream set in Berkeley at the height of the
troubles of the 1960s.  Theseus was the Berkeley Chief of Police.  Hippolyta
was a protest leader whom he had under house arrest.  The lovers were
innocent flower children.  The rustics were solid working-class types in
denim overalls.  The elves and fairies were, um, examples of the more
_unusual_ types you could see along Telegraph Avenue--tie-dyed, pot-smoking,
and weird.  Puck was this long-haired, black-bearded apparition who hopped
around like a frog.  They showed it on the local PBS channel one night and
I *wish*  I had taped it....

Greaden in Digest #568 (my gosh, up to #568!)   "An 8 hour AoA looks quite
good; people who can do Peerage scrolls can do them in 5. (THere are some
who can do them in 2 or less, but these folk are the exception.)"

So, can I tell you about this really great scroll I got just last weekend?
It isn't layered with tons of paint or gold leaf.  In fact, except for one
thing it only has a very nicely calligraphed statement.  But the calligraphy is
nice.  And, oh, that one thing.  It is a beautiful capital "A" done in gold
with a tiny bit of vine and leaves trailing off of it.  And what looks from the
distance like a solid red square is actually a checkerboard of 1/8" squares
done in two different shades of red with a little white dot in the middle of
each of the squares of one color.  I'm told that the lady who did the "A" is
fairly knew to making scrolls and spent the better part of an event in the
royalty room making it.  It is classic, simple and beautiful.  Course, it's
also mine so I'm biased.

Which brings me to the next quote
"My own thought on that is 'Where is it written that it's gotta be a scroll?' -
I think we collectively suffer from a modern 'it's not real until it's written
down attitude."Also Greaden in Digest #568

Well, forgive me if this sounds too sappy for words, but I would have been very
happy to receive the award minus the scroll too.  But there is this amazing
thing about this scroll
Looking at it reminds me that
    ....a bunch of people I know took the time to write letters about me
         .....so that two people I only kind of know gave me an award
              ....and two people I don't know took the time and care to make
                  something lovely to mark the event.
Kind of amazing when you stop to really think about it.

This award was "just a li'l ole AoA", but even if it was a "mucking big
peerage", I would be ridiculously pleased with my scroll.  It is what that
piece of paper symbolizes.  The scroll is the candy rose on top of the icing on
top of the cake (speaking of symbols ;-)  (Course, I happen to think my scroll
is pleasing to the eye, so maybe my opinion doesn't count :-)

The calligrapher and artist included their address on the back of the scroll.
Thanks to having my consciousness raised by the Rialto, they're getting a
thank you note.  Geez, my mother would be so proud of me.... :-)

        Arval, shame on you!!!   Actors don't wear helmets in battle scenes
because then you couldn't see their faces!  Now really.

        And as for why they got off their horses to fight in the mud, I seem
to recall from my English Medieval History class some years ago that at the
Battle of Agincourt the French charged up the hill and got repelled by the
english archers, whereupon they decided that since that didn't work they'd
try it again this time without their horses!  (That didn't work very well
either).

        As for Olivier, I am not sure that it is a better production.  The nice
thing about the new play is that there is more than one character.  I love
Olivier and his work is astounding in many ways, but his movies tend to have a
sort of one-man-show feel about them.  Also, the way the new film blends the
reality of the "play" and its constant reminders that we are indeed watching a
play and are not really there with the sense of immediacy that the play has.
Derek Jacobi is always there telling us that this is theater, beggin our
forgiveness for the fact that they cannot put an entire battle on a small stage
while at the same time the battle _is_ there, in full fury.  what supports this
clever dichotomy is the cinematographic direction, whereby we never have a full
panoramic view, but instead are shown tight pictures of individual actions,
much as we would on stage while alway being aware that there is a huge battle
going on to an extent that would be nearly impossible on stage.

        Anyway, there are a lot of great adaptations of Shakespeare to Film -
the BBC's Wars of the Roses,  Olivier's Henry V and Richard III, and one of my
favorites, Romeo and Juliet by (and here's how you can tell I loved it - I
can't remember the director's name) the fellow who does all the work in the
big opera house in NY.   In my humble opinion, This new Henry V ranks up there
with the best of them.

Miscellaneous comments today...

I disagree with Arval about the readability of both Fox-Davies and Boutell's.  
I find Fox-Davies terribly boring, and very Victorian to boot.  It's a great 
reference, though, especially if you have the knowledge to sort out the post-
period data as you go.  Boutell's, on the other hand, I found simple and
clear, as well as easy to read.  And, I read it when I first joined the SCA 
and was getting into heraldry-- *after* I had been given Fox-Davies as a gift, 
and found it unreadable.  Boutell's is still (IMHO) the best for explaining
for the basics of heraldry to a beginner.  It is still the book I most often 
recommend.

RE:  Basil Rathbone's fencing prowess-- if you *really* wanna see something, 
check out "The Mark of Zorro" starring Rathbone and Tyrone Power.  Power's 
mother was an Olympic fencer, and she trained her son accordingly.  The duel 
between Rathbone and Power near the film's end is between two masters, and was 
in no small degree improvised.  All other film duels pale incredibly beside 
this one!

To Greadan:  I realized you weren't flaming me, and your points are well 
taken.  I think we all need to realize that all of the aspects noted during
the course of the discussion on scribes are significantly affected by local 
conditions, such as number of available scribes in a given Kingdom.  Such 
local conditions can unconsciously affect our thinking.

I should like to add that I *very* much like the idea of the scribe(s) placing
their name(s), at least, on the backs of scrolls.  To thank a person, one must 
first know their identity!  :-)

Finally:  my thanks to William de Corbie for both his marvelous Glogg recipe, 
and the witty presentation thereof!

I presume that by "commercial frames" you mean "cheap pre-assembled
frames with precut mats available at 'art supply' stores."  Any
professional framer should have no problem dealing with a wax seal.  I
have not checked, but I suspect that a "do-it-yourself" frame shop
could also succesfully handle the problem.  I don't know how much more
a do-it-yourself framer costs than a budget frame, but for the quality
of work that goes into many of these scrolls, one should put out the
bucks.  

Harald Longfellow

p.s.  Of course, many SCA artisans would be able to make a frame to
match the scroll, probably cheaper than a frame store, since so many
of our artisans undervalue their work when selling (and then when one
comes by who charges a fair price, they get screamed at!)

It is long since I have seen him, and I know not how to find him.  If any have

It may help to know that he is never seen in the company of his sworn enemy,

I see your point about Olivier's work, but I question your conclusion
that the current version is much different.  I think, more than
anything alse, it's a function of the material.  Henry V is very much
a one-man show, much moreso than many of Shakespeare's plays.  Aside
from the low characters and the two or three French nobles, no one
else really matters except Henry.  What I prefer about the Olivier
production is the power and emotion he puts into the speeches.  The
new production is certainly emotional, but most of it comes from the
sheer magnitude of the production, not the acting.

Interesting idea.  The play does give the director a problem: No
matter how realistic he may want to make the production, the Chorus
will intrude and give the play a stagy feel.  The Derek Jacobi role
was a good solution.  However, I felt that the predominence of tight
close-ups was a negative aspect of the film.  It loses the grandure
which could have come from wide views of the battlefield.  It
overwhelms the audience.  This is a style, alas, which we will see
more and more often, since such film is more easily adapted to a
TV-sized screen.

Peace be upon all from Mustapha al-Muhaddith.

I just wanted to append a few additions to Lord Brigantia's excellent
listing of heraldic sources.  I believe that Fox-Davies has also put
out a book called the "Art of Heraldry" which may be of more interest
to Bleydion ap Rhys if he is trying to produces heraldic artwork.  

I personally tend to use a slim volume by Oliver, I've forgotten the
title.  But it has a relatively complete listing of field divisions,
ordinaries and postures for the basic charges.  It is also easier to
lug to fighting practice and dance class than Fox-Davies (which must
mass a good 5 kg).  It was given to me as a Chrismass gift by somebody
who always shops at a remaindered bookstore, so it could be cheap if
it is still available.

I also remember the advice given to me by Firebrand Herald when I
first expressed interest:  "You can trust any author with a hypenated

Actually, the reason the French dismounted to attack was that they had seen
the English men-at-arms sucessfully using this tactic, especially at Crecy.
What the French missed out on was that the English used dismounted knights
to protect archer formations, in a defensive mode. The French, having badly
lost both major and minor battles to this tactic, decided that dismounting
knights was the way to win, at least against the English.

             So much for the French chivalry.

Anyone interested in reading an excellent account of the tactics used at
Agincourt, and esp. what it was like for the infantry, should look up John

Well, a while back I requested generic texts for AoA's.  That was just before
Christmas (and a merry season to you all), so it's taken me a while to get
back to it.  On the other hand, I somehow lost all the saved copies I had.
However, I did get what I wanted.
Personally, the story above is almost scary, in its sheer numbers.  I think 
it would be nice for the scribe to put their address on the back, for that
purpose.  But the back won't be looked at much, other than for checking for
name/address, right?  What would be good is a way for the scribe's name to be
on the front, where anybody can see it when the scroll gets shown to them.
So, as a starter idea:
(Disclaimer:remember, I'm not yet a member, so I don't know if this has been
tried, is against a Kingdom's policies, etc.  If it has or is, I apologize.)
Most of the texts that got sent to me ended with
Done (whatever date) by our hand and seal, (the Monarchs names), 
or variations thereof.  Could the scribe put, just before this,
Inscribed by (the scribe's name)?  I got this from a fantasy book where a lord
was sending a letter.  He was mostly illiterate (could only write his name), 
so he dictated the letter, and had the scribe add the inscribed part.  Why 
he did it in the book I'm not sure, but it seems (to me) a reasonable 
way to solve part of the recognition problem in the SCA.
Ideas, comments?  I welcome anything, and again apologize for my ignorance.

      OK, OK, I know that I am a little behind the times, but being on a

not been on the net sincef

itself long enough for me to type . . .
  
     Scroll wax:  It's a big thing here in Meridies, with big blobs of
wax and seals and ribbons and the whole shebang.  There is one big problem
with sealing wax that I can see:
  
     Once you've put the wax on, unless you get it really flat, the scroll
will no longer fit into most commercial frames.
  
     If someone out there in another Kingdom who uses wax has an answer to
this problem, I'd love to hear it.  Here, with the standard scrolls, most
people don't frame their scrolls.  They throw them in a drawer.
  
     Standard wordings:  I agree with Ariel and other Eastern folk that the
Book of Standards in the East probably had one of the best systems.  There
would be about twenty different ways to open (Be it known, to all whom these

ways of writing the royalty lines (Dick and Jane, King and Queen of the
East; Dick, King by Right of Arms, and Jane, Our Queen, etc.), etc.  You
get the idea.  Then you could mix and match wordings until you got the
feel for how a scroll wording would be put together.
  
     However, I only partly agree with Arval with the Midrealm being the
worst.  Certainly I've found that the wordings are too severe (and dull, I
heartily agree), but it's oodles of times worse when it's combined with a
standard layout (and let'
s not even mention the xeroxed scrolls colored in with magic markers!).
There just isn't the excitement about scrolls here.  It's sad.
   
    Scroll time:  Part of being a scribe is time management.  Sure, I 
spent sixty hours apiece on a matching set of scrolls for Duke Randal of
the Dark and Katherine Stanhope, but I also put out one of the best scrolls
in my career, a Silver Crescent (Eastern ki
ngdom service awards), between
the hours of eleven PM and four AM.  A five-hour Silver Crescent is almost
unheard of, but every scribe has experienced the Great Adrenaline Rush when
for a few brief hours, they were posessed by all the greatest scribes in
Europe or something like that.
  
    But I didn't neglect other scrolls during the period that I was doing
Randal and Katherine's scrolls . . . I just learned to figure out what
part of my day would be spent doi
ng scrolls, what I had to get done, what
had to be done first, etc.  And I finished the ducal/county scrolls a
month before their Coronation and still fulfilled my normal load.  
  
    It's against my philosophy to say "It's just an AoA . . . it's not 
important."  How many of you out there, even you peers, thought that
your AoA wasn't important when you got it?

Message-Id: <5306@tekgen.BV.TEK.COM>

My fiance found this on comp.risks. I thought it might interest SCA folk, 
so I've included it here (verbatim from risks).

    RISKS-LIST: RISKS-FORUM Digest  Thursday 4 January 1990   Volume 9:Issue 57

    The last paragraph suggests the RISKS were the same 700 years ago.

[From The Times (London) Saturday, December 23, 1989 by Simon Tait,
Arts Correspondent]

A seal, which would have been the equivalent of cheque card, passport
and credit card rolled into one for the person who lost it more than
700 years ago, has been found by archaeologists working in Oxford.

Mr. David Dawson, of the Oxfordshire County Museum, Woodstock, where the seal
will go on display, said: "This was a personal seal which would have been
carried round everywhere by the owner.  He would have been lost without it, 
and it is a rare thing to find because it would normally have been destroyed 
on his death."

What makes the small, corroded and fragile 13th-century seal unique is that it
was found in premises known, through records in the Bodleian Library, to belong
to the seal's owner.

It bears the legend `S' ROGERUM COMENORE CLICI, indicating that the seal
(sigillum) belonged to Roger of Cumnor, clerk or priest, who worker as a
lawyer.  The site is on the corner of Hollybush Row in Oxford, on which 
Halls Brewery stood most recently, which is being developed by Grosvenor 
Square Property Developers.

Roger gave two buildings on it [the site] to Oseney Abbey in 1265, during 
the reign of Henry III, according to the Bodleian Library.  The seal was 
found in a ditch between the two buildings.

Mr. Brian Durham, a member of the Oxford Archaeological Unit which made the
discovery during excavations last week, said: "The new find could be a forgery
but the more likely explanation is that it is his early seal, which he lost
when he was actually living in the house.  You can picture him hunting
unsuccessfully for it."

"Since he worked, in effect, as a solicitor, he would have had to alert
everyone to the fact that the seal could have been stolen and used for
forgeries.  Then he would have had to have a different seal made."

Hail fellow fisherfolk, from Gwilym who appears courtesy his Lady wife,
Kasia.

Reading three weeks of postings at one go is a little hard on the head but one
thing stuck out that I should find out and that was getting an address, etc.
for the "Canadian College of Heralds."

With the Canadian Governments usual fondness for weasel words the Canadian
College of Heralds is called the Canadian Heraldic Authority, the Canada King
of Arms is the Chief Canadian Herald and so on. It appears from the address
I was given that the Heraldic Authority is a part of the Governor-General's
personal staff. (For those unfamiliar with British Dominions, the Governor-
General is the Queen's personal representative in that Dominion, with something
approaching vice-regal powers. As the Queen herself is mostly a figurehead,
so too with the Governors-General.)

Anyway, for those interested the address is below:

Canadian Heraldic Authority          Chief Canadian Herald

Subject: Re: Books on Heraldry
Message-Id: <Jan.8.12.23.44.1990.24090@paul.rutgers.edu>

Greetings from Arval!

Bleydion ap Rhys asks for some suggestions on basic heraldry
references.  The most common standard reference on real-world heraldry
is A.C. Fox-Davies, "A Complete Guide to Heraldry" (Bonanza Books).
This books is widely available in bookstores and libraries, and is
owned by a good percentage of the heralds of the SCA.  It is a good
introduction to English heraldry, with some material on continental
heraldry.  It will teach you the names of charges, how to blazon, how
heraldry works, etc.  It is a condensed version of his much longer
"Encyclopedia of Heraldry", which is a WONDERFUL source for research
on period style, but difficult for a beginner.  

If you can find it, an even better introductory work is Julian
Franklyn, "Shield and Crest".  It is out of print, and available only
a libraries.  However, it is readable, and heavily illustrated with
real armory.  One flaw in Fox-Davies' book is that the illustrations
show individual charges, not how they are combined.  Franklyn's
pictures show full devices, many in color.  Every illustration is
blazoned, so it is also a great way to learn English blazonry.

A couple good introductory books on Continental heraldry is Von
Volborth "Heraldry: Styles...".  It is less thorough than the two
noted above, but shows a bunch of interesting styles that you won't
see in the English books.

Avoid "Boutell's Heraldry".  Although it is a reasonably good survey
of British heraldry, it is absolutely the most boring thing written,
and contains a good deal of mis-information.

A good study of the historical role of the herald in European society
is Rodney Dennys, "Heralds and Heraldry".  Many good pictures,
available is bookstores sometimes.

If you are feeling really serious about it, and want to read something
a little more in-depth, try flipping through Parker's "Glossary of
Terms used in Heraldry" or Woodward's "A Treatise on Heraldry British
and Foreign".  Both are essentially catalogues of heraldic usage.
Parker is pretty readable, in small doses, and contains some amusing
anecdotes.  Woodward is as heavy as bread-pudding, but extremely
thorough.  I tried to read it once, and gave up after about 150 pages.

When reading any of this stuff, remember that SCA heraldry is not the
same as mundane heraldry.  We have our own styles, restrictions, etc.
However, medieval heraldry should always be the starting and ending
points. 

Once you get a good grounding in the terminology of heraldry, I
recommend getting Compleat Anachronist #22, "Heraldry."  This essay,
written by Master Marten Broeker and myself, is a discussion of
how to design heraldry for use in the SCA.  I like to think it is
pretty well-written :)  It cost $2, and will be in stock at the Stock
Clerk's office in a few months.

Several Kingdoms have Heralds' Handbooks, which are wonderful things.
The West, the Middle, and Atlantia (in preparation) all have pretty
good handbooks, which are available to anyone interested (I think :).
Other Kingdoms may have them.  Contact a senior herald near you for
information.  

For the more advanced student, some good ways to keep a finger on the
pulse of heraldry (neat metaphors, huh?) in the SCA, are the Laurel
Letters of Acceptance and Returns (monthly, available by subscription
for $18/year) and my own Brigantia Letters of Report (monthly, $12 per
year).  The former letters summarize decisions on names and armory by
the Laurel Queen of Arms, note changes in the rules, give book
reviews, etc.  They are THE best source for heraldry in the SCA today.
However, they do require a firm grounding in the basics.  My reports
are similar in intent, and cover only Eastern submissions, in more
detail.  They come with drawings of each piece of armory.  They are
primarily of interest to Easterners, but are available to anyone.  

Finally, I would like to plug the East Kingdom College of Heralds' new
quarterly newsletter, "Millrind".  It is a ten page (or so) newsletter
containing an assortment of articles, cartoons, and references.
Regular features are "Submission: Impassable", a selection of heraldic
puns in cartoon by Senor Alfredo el Bufon; "Out of the Ordinary", a
series of ordinaries of armory from unusual sources.  It is available
to anyone by subscription for $3.00 per year.  Deals are offered for
contributors.  If anyone is interested, I'll send you the address of
the editor.  I believe that the three back-issues are also available.
Full information will appear in the February Pikestaff.

Heraldically yours,

	Arval.

My first scroll, an AoA, was given to me through a very sneaky number by
then-King Randal of the Dark of the East during his first reign.  I was
the herald at the court, and just as "Being no further business before this
Court . . ." was leaving my mouth, hsl
  (excuse me . . . this damned
computer had a fit) he pulled out a scroll from underneath his cloak and
asked me how to pronounce this name . . . pointing to my name on the scroll!
So I had the honor of having the king read the scroll himself, while I

Greetings from Arval, net.Herald!

Lord Tashuurijn asks for help developing armory for his 13th C
Mongolian persona.

Oof.  This is a difficult one.  It is difficult to fit heraldry to a
persona from a culture which didn't have it.  The Mongols had banners
and emblems of rank, but they tended to be very simple, very
restricted, and associated with the highest nobility.  The horse-tail
banners of the Khans are not really appropriate for an SCA persona,
which is assumed to be minor nobility.  Generally, the best approach
for a non-European persona is to design something European in style,
but using a charge which refers to your own culture.  Remember: A
Mongol in the SCA is thought of as a visitor to the West.  Any armory
he bears would be armory awarded by a western monarch, and, thus,
would certainly be in a western style.

For a Mongol persona, you might use a charge like a scimitar, or a
horse, or a saddle.  You might even use a Saracen's Head, a good
period charge (if gruesome).  The Saracen's were enemies of both
Mongol and Christian, and there was a time when the Pope sent
emissaries to the Mongols in the hope of forming an alliance to defeat
the Saracen.  One might consder oneself an ambassador from the Mongols
to the Pope, awarded arms by some Italian monarch.  You could get a
similar reference by using a charge referring to Prester John.

The weapon you describe sounds a bit too complex for effective use in
armory...We try to aim for simple, instantly recognizable design.
However, if you can document its form, it should be acceptable.

Sorry if this came off discouraging. I think you might be able to do
some neat stuff.  If any of my ideas struck a positive note for you,
or if you want to bounce something off me, please reply.

Well, he couldn't have been, because the baddie in The Court Jester was
Basil Rathbone and he died some years ago.  He also played the baddie in
the Errol Flynn Robin Hood.

Rathbone was hands-down the best fencer in Hollywood.  The problem was that,
except when he was playing Sherlock Holmes,* he was usually cast as the
villain and had to lose fights to actors who weren't a tenth as good as he
was.  People who fence and who watch these scenes can pick out dozens of
moments when Rathbone _could_ have taken Kaye, Flynn, etc., apart and didn't.

----
*Holmes, of course, was an expert fencer.  But I've never seen any of
Rathbone's Holmes movies so I don't know if he ever got a chance to show
off.

Greetings from Arval!

My lady and I went to see Henry V last weekend, and loved it.  It is
grand, splendid, spectacular, and good Shakespeare.  Derek Jacobi
makes a fine chorus.  The interpretation is different from Olivier's
version, but quite valid.  BTW: If anyone out there HASN'T seen
Olivier's Henry V, Shame on you!  Rent it & watch it.  It is better.

However...  Any medievalist seeing the new Henry would have some
quibbles.  If you haven't seen it yet, you might want to skip the rest
of this posting.  It has a few minor spoilers.




Did anyone else notice the following, positive and negative?


Negative:

...The only full suit of armor in the movie was 3 or 4 hundered years
out-of-period? 

...Why don't warriors in movie wear helmets in battle?

...Why did they all get off their horses to fight in the mud?

...Why didn't they show us the French charge.  I know it would have
been expensive, but after that build-up, it would have been WONDERFUL!

...In the scene after the battle, did you notice that two of the dead
bodies twitched?

...Are we really supposed to believe that the King of England lives in
such Spartan surroundings?

...Phooey.  They cut the scene where Fluellen makes Pistol eat a leek.
Olivier's version did that so well.

...There were only two pieces of heraldry used before the battle.
Seems odd to me.

...Where was the English herald?  He's in the script, and should have
been there (Professional jealousy).  And, they cut my favorite line,
when, after one of the scenes between Henry & Mountjoy, Henry tooses
him a bag of gold, saying "Here's for your troubles."  :)

Positive: 

...Did you notice that the treaty signed in the last scene has an
illuminated capital?

...The heraldry in the battle made up for lots of the negatives.  Wow!

...Period tennis balls!!

...I love that they made all the noblemen young, just like they should
be!!  A lot of the play is much more believable when Henry, the
Dauphin, etc. are in their twenties, rather than their forties.

...Was the actor who played Essex REALLY the same guy who fought Danny
kaye in the Court Jester?  No, not really, but he sure looked the
same!


Awaiting your flames :)

King Christian elevated 3 Laurels and a Knight.  After the Coronation
of Jade and Amanda (his 4th and her 2nd), he elevated 1 Pelican and 1 Knight.

The was a short Queen's Champion List in the morning that was won by
Viscount Sir Robert of Wood's-End.  duke Frederick of Holland was named

Many presentations were made to each King.

Royalty also present were the King of Atenveldt, the King of Caid, the

     I can't let such a fun topic die out, so here are a few more
suggested un-historical ideas.

     Rose hip tea is good for vitamin C, so it is good against scurvy.
The Brit. navy suffered until someone had them take lime juice to
prevent it, thus they are now called "limeys". I think some good
herbalist should have gotten them started on their wave-ruling earlier
with the tea instead. We could then call them "rosies".
     Master Kobayashi says the Stirling engine wouldn't have occurred to
anyone, but it isn't that hard to invent a course of events leading to
it. Alternate reality science fiction writers try to do it all the time.
First; know about the Aeliopile, the ancient steam toy. (it was only
good as a toy) Second; remember the reverence for ancient wisdom among
medieaval scholars. Now, assume some wealthy prince wants one as a toy,
and hires a clock-master to build it. (they had some really fancy
clockwork) If neither of them have any idea of what the Aeliopile was
like, they would have to invent something new, and how many of you
expect an engineer with a big budget to make something simple?

Oh, HIM.  Well.  I don't know who Oswald was, but Essex I gather was played
by Brian Blessed (whom I've seen playing everything from King Voltan to
J. S. Bach), so I know the physical type you're talking about.

Cher de Bellevue states that keeping the scribes sane might be regarded as
a reason to support some degree of standardization.  (So far, so good - it
*is* nice to have a formula handy when you are starting/rushed, etc. I was
only objecting to homogenaity of wording, not standardization, honest! :])
Then she mentions the 'X' word. :[

Scribal sanity *isn't* (at least this scribe's, which is tenuous anyway :] )
based on 'fulfilling the kingdom beauracry's need for nice looking bit of
paper'; it is based on feeling like the *medieval* skills of calligraphy
and illumination (each of which is a complex of skills, rather like such
terms as 'armoring' and 'embroidery') are of use to one's liege lord and
fellows.  Quite honestly, the day the Crown of the Midrealm gives out 
*as a scroll* a photocopy of *anything* (in Ealdormere, anyway :] )
I stop working for the scribes office, deeply insulted.

There is a need for fast bits of paper, yes; these are called promisories
and trying to use them like scrolls is really lowering the quality
of an AoA, something I feel serves no one well.  An 8 hour AoA looks quite
good; people who can do Peerage scrolls can do them in 5. (THere are some
who can do them in 2 or less, but these folk are the exception.) The complaint
is with the idea that there is something out there that just causes scrolls
to happen, rather than to being asked to produce so *many* scrolls.
The numbers issue is a seperate concern, and that gets into the issue
of award density and several dozen other things.  My own thought on that
is 'Where is it written that it's gotta be a scroll?' - I think we collectively
suffer from a modern 'it's not real until it's written down' attitude.
(The numbers issue would probably go away if most Royalty was aware of the
number of scribes, and the number of hours per scroll, in a given region.)

There is also something to be said for the An Tir system of giving you 
your AoA as a promisory automatically, and then arranging to have it
done as a scroll when you pass arms. 

(I'm not snarking at you, Cher, really - imagine how you would feel if 
it was decided not to take off points for the use of synthetic fabric
in the garb categories of A&S competitions.)

On the subject of scribery, I have a painful story to relate.  As you
may have read, I was moved by the stories of overworked scribes, so,
when I received my award of arms, I found the address of the scribe
and wrote a thank-you note.  She promptly wrote back to say it was her
third thank-you note, and she was very excited to receive it.  By her
husband's count, she has done over *ONE THOUSAND* scrolls.  Ouch!

Perhaps it wouldn't be a bad idea for a scribe to put an address as
well as a name on the back of the scroll?  What think you?

Greetings!

My curiosity is aroused, what with all this talk about Polanski's "MacBeth."  
Does anybody know if it's available in the US on cassette (so that it's 
rentable)?

The new "Henry V" hasn't hit Gainesville yet, but I'm watching for it.  One 
thing that a number of critics have noted in comparing this film to Olivier's 
version, is that Olivier's film was made during WWII.  Olivier's treatment of 
the play was therefore (allegedly and accordingly) geared somewhat towards 
rousing public/patriotic support for Britain's war effort.  I'll be interested 
to see how the two films compare to me.

What are some of other gentles' favorite Shakespearean performers/
performances?  (I always find the answer to that one interesting!  :-)  Mine 
include Nicol Williamson's "MacBeth" and "Hamlet," as well as both Olivier's 
and Derek Jacobi's "Hamlets".  I also enjoyed (much to my own surprise) 
Richard Chamberlain's "Hamlet," which a lot of people forget and which was a 
great critical success at the time.  I'll watch damn near any version of 
"Taming of the Shrew", including the send-up done on "Moonlighting."  I also 
love the 30's movie version of "Midsummer Night's Dream" starring Merle
Oberon, with Micky Rooney as Puck (*still* my favorite Puck!)  The Royal 
Shakespeare Company did a really neat version of the same play, as did the 
Brooklyn College of Music in the early '70s (one literally had to be a gymnast 
to be in that one!)

What about everybody else?

For that matter, there's Ye Olde Argumente about the "true" authorship of 
Shakespeare's plays, to wit:  did he or didn't he?  And, if he didn't, who 
maybe did?  Can we ever be sure?

Subject: Let there be glogg
Message-Id: <900109222705.20.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

Greetings from William de Corbie!

I want to introduce you, dear gentles, to glogg. Everyone should have lots
of glogg. Glogg is a blessing unto mankind. Once you have had a true glogg,
you will understand.

What is glogg?

Glogg is the best drink in the world. Glogg is essential to anyone living
in Sweden or some other place where winters are cold. Coming in from the
freezing white world of snow and wind, breathing white fog, with ice in
your beard, there is nothing like a big cup of really hot, strong glogg.

Actually, glogg is spelled with two dots above the o, and the o is pro-
nounced like the vowel in "birth", or the French "eu".

Some ignorant people think that glogg is just "mulled wine", or similar to
the German "gluhwein". That is like comparing crystal to clay. Most Swedes
buy their glogg from the state-owned monopoly alcohol company. Theirs is
quite good, but for the real glogg lovers it is not quite lethal enough.
It only holds about 18 percent (per weight).

There are many different recipes, of which I will only give you one. But
it is among the best:

Mix 10 g whole cardamoms,10 g whole cloves, 25 g whole cinnamon sticks
with 1 litre vodka.
Leave standing for 3-4 days.
Strain the vodka. Mix with:
1 bottle cheap red wine, 1/2 bottle non-vintage port
Add syrup sugar made from 250 g castor sugar and a cup of water.
Add 10 cl brandy and the juice of 1/2 lemon.

(Some people prefer to use brandy instead of the vodka. In olden tymes,
the spices were put in the wine, which was heated. Then, lumps of hard
sugar were placed on a grille above the pot and burning brandy or vodka
was poured over them to add sweetness and strength. I doubt that this
procedure improves anything.)

Serving: Have your servants prepare the glogg while you take a long walk
through the snow, in temperatures well below freezing (-20 centigrade is
about right). Make sure you are really cold and that you long intensely
for warmth and comfort. 

Meanwhile, the servants should heat the glogg until it is real hot but
not boiling. Then pour it in small glasses or cups containing a few
almonds and raisins, and provide a teaspoon for eating the almonds &
raisins. There should also be Swedish pepparkakor (ginger bisquits) to
nibble on.

Have the servants give you the glogg at the gate of your castle. Your
fingers should be so numb that you can hardly hold the cup - then it will
really be great. Drink one cup there, proceed inside and have a second cup
as soon as you have taken your winter garments off. Sit down in front of a
roaring fire and have another 2-3 cups. If you don't have a fire, a hot
sauna will do.

Enjoy!

William de Corbie
