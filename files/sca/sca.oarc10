Milord Fred,

I have attempted to reach you via email and farspeaker, to no avail.  This
machine has been suffering from a split personality and has not been allowing
me to get my mail out.  We were discussing 1) Your offer to get info on the
Marklanders for my map of atlantia, 2) a contact person so that I could get
hold of the Marklanders myself.

Thank you for your cooperation.  BTW, I expect to be at the Baron and Baroness
Lochmere tourney shooting to be the Baroness Champion.  It's in Owings Mills,
Maryland.  

Yours in Service,

Unto all who wrote asking for a copy of Chainmail Mama, fear not, it's coming.
I hope to get to the copier this weekend (I failed to reach it last weekend)
and put them in the mail.  I have attempted to send email to everyone I've
received a missive from, but most of my mail has been coming back to me.  If
you don't get hard copy in a about a week, let me know, as it should be out by
then.

As promised, I'm putting another song on the Rialto.  It's an oldy but goody.


Seven Old Ladies

Chorus:
And it's oh dear, what can the matter be?
seven old ladies got stuck in the lavat'ry,
they were there from Sunday till Saturday
Nobody knew they were there.

Verses:
The first old lady was Jennifer Prim,
She went in on a personal whim,
She got herself stuck betwixt bowl and the rim,
and nobody knew she was there

The second old lady was old Mrs Humphrey,
When she went in, she made herself comfey,
When she trid to get up, she couldn't get her bum free,
and nobody knew she was there.

The third old lady was Chit Chester's daughter
She went in to get rid of some water,
She very near drownded, for the rising tide caught her,
and nobody knew she was there.

The fourth old lady was skinny Miss Boulder,
She sat on the throne, there was no one to hold her,
Quick as a flash she was up to her shoulder,
and nobody knew she was there

The fifth old lady was old Mrs  Craper,
When she went she couldn't find the paper,
the only thing there was a bricklayers scraper,
and nobody knew whe was there

Teh sixth old lady was old Mrs Mason
She had to be quick, so she used the basin,
And that was the water that I washed me face in !
And I didn't know she'd been there.

The seventh old lady was old Mrs Bender,
She went in to adjust a suspender,
She got herself entangled with the masculine gender,
nobody knew I was there.

Yours in service to musical mayhem,

I would like to express my pleasant surprise at all the requests that are
arriving for the reference materials I offered. It is always nice to find
other people who are actively pursuing knowledge in the SCA. Mistress Cher
and I are putting together a listing so that materials can be mass mailed,
please have patience we will send all soon. (Cher don't look at me like that...

who called me, and whose name I have forgotton, please remember that in
the mundane world there are such things as time zones. Yes, it REALLY was

I have been asked by their Excellencies Baron Elom and Baroness Ara of An
Crosaire to enlist the aid of the People of the Rialto in locating Viscount
Guthram of the Wastelands and Viscountess Ursula Katze (mka: Ken Purdin and
Collie Collier). They were last seen speeding off towards Texas, although
rumour has it (he does does he?! :) that they may not have gotten the brakes
to work untill they reached California. Their friends would like assurances
that they are still alive, active, etc.  We greatly appreciate any assistance.

BaShem HaShem HaRachmon. Unto the Gentles of the Rialto may this missive find
you in good health and spirits. MaAyt shel- Yonatan Moshe Bereb Avram Yitzhak.

Gentles, I must crave your indulgence the following discussion is unpleasant.

I have been asked by several members of the peerage and general members of the
Barony An Crosaire to inquire as to the ability of local groups to bar or
remove disruptive members from attending meetings.  For the past 2 years a
situation has continued in the Barony with a few members who attend meetings
specifically to verbally attack, slander, and harass other members. These
individuals have been asked to keep their comments civil, but they
invariably do not. They have physically attempted to intimidate disagreeing
members (short of actual violence). The Crown has been most helpful, but
accurately sees this as a Baronial matter and would like to leave it to
the Barony to handle. They have agreed to back the Barony in whatever course
is necessary. Are there any hard and factual instances that may be used for
precedent -- emphasis on fact, the individuals believe in court actions as
a viable means to harass/intimidate.  The situation has gotten bad enough
that at least one victim may seek civil redress. The Barony is already
taping all of its meetings as a means of securing an unbiased account, but
one of the "problems" has already altered his personal copy of the tapes
and attempted to pass it off as the real thing. Luckily, the individuals
he tried this on already had copies of the uncut original...  As I said,
very very unpleasant.
I apologize for airing this on the Rialto, but I was commanded to place this
before you. I thank you on behalf of the Barony.

The winner of the Trimaris Spring Crown Tourney, held this past weekend at the

is unknown to me, and who is squire to Sir Riekin ap Gruagach.  Llywellyn's
consort is Mistress Elina Thrymsfostra, who is mundanely sister to HRM Baldar
Longstriter, our Reigning King.  All in attendance seemed to be truly in
agreement that the best fighter on the field prevailed.

Also, a mundane note:  please be aware that pretty much all of the Univ. of
Florida's mainframes underwent a massive crash over the weekend, and are just
coming back up.  Anyone who attempted contact with anyone down here probably
had the mail bounce or black-hole.

(b) a bibliography of Medieval (and Earlier) Jewish superstitions and
beliefs concerning magic (gets complicated linguistically :)
(c) a bibliography of Early and Medieval Christian Monastic Communities
and (d) A discussion concerning the setting up of Eruvin at events and
other concerns of the more orthodox among us (thanks to Yaakov Hamizrahi

A warning is hereby issued unto all...

The infamous Lord William de Corbie is back on the net after a
two-week vacation in Israel - where he visited many Holy Places
Where Shorts Are Not Permitted, saw some nice but unreadable
Hebrew calligraphy, traveled throughhe Intifada-land with
stone-throwing Arabs and gun-firing Jew had 2 flat tires in 
the Judaean Desert, climbed Masada at 4:30 am, bathed in the
Lake of Genesaret, ate Kosher food and generally had a fun and
somewhat weird time in a very different land.

It was quite a great feeling to stand at the very spot where
the crusaders breached the walls of Jerusalem in 1099, to see
the swor Godfrey, to climb Belvoir and see the mighty castles
of the Johannites at Acre. 

But now I'm back in the Current Middle Ages. So beware!

Regarding the "true history of Michael of Boarshaven" that recently appeared
here, I would suggest that anyone who desires more information on Michael
and his times should contact Baron Daemon de Folo of the Barony of Wurm Wald.
Baron Folo was of course present throughout Michael's reign and did compile
a history of it. It was kind of Dame Enid to share her memories of that time,
but I can honestly say that her account is not at all what I remember.
In as much as I am the Johnnae llyn Lewis that Dame Enid mentions as
receiving her AoA and Fret at that Festival of Maidens,
(by way of correction I was at that time Johnnae of the Hawks Flying),
I was most certainly around prior to, during, and after Michael's reign.
Having joined the SCA in August, 1973, in what was then the Shire of Wurm Wald,
I was privy to the local scene in a way that Dame Enid was not. Michael's
reign has become such a part of Society folklore since those days of 1976
that it would be almost impossible to sort out the various versions of the
truth that people thought at the time or have come to believe since.
Baron Folo's published account does a very good job of capturing what
went on when in Michael's reign; there are of course at least a few of us
"OLDE WURM WALDIANS" around that might be asked in person. Around a campfire
some evening at a War or summer event, ask us and we might tell you what we
remember. A glowing campfire is more of an inducement to memory than this
glowing green screen that sits before me.

I Remain, Sincerely,


Lady Johnnae llyn Lewis

Subject: The Reason for no Minors at Pennsic

This shall be short, for the reasons that minors are not allowed at Pennsic
have been discussed many times.
Minors (under 18) are not allowed at Pennsic for MEDICAL reasons, not for
Behavioral reasons.  If you are under 18 and are injured, no matter where you
are in America, you can NOT be treated for ANYTHING until your legal
guardians/parents give the ok.  A note from your parents putting other adults
in charge does not make the other adults your guardians.
It`s not my idea, it`s the law of the land.

Subject: minors at Pennsic

Unto Saethydd O'Shrewsbury and the good gentles of the Rialto, Li Kung Lo
sends greetings! Milord, I feel that you (and many others) misunderstand the
proscription against minors at Pennsic unaccompanied by their parents or legal
guardians. First, this has been in effect since Pennsic XVII (last year).
Secondly, it is not the opinion of anyone within the SCA, or even necessarily
the opinions of the Coopers which make this necessary, but rather the opinion
of the Cooper's attorneys, based on requirements of mundane law. First of all,
a minor under Pennsylvania law is anyone under 18 years of age. There is a
special category called "emancipated" minor, who is treated as an adult by
law, and could attend Pennsic alone. The problem is largely that in
Pennsylvania (and many Eastern states) medical care *cannot* be given to a
minor without the express written (and specific) consent of his/her legal
parents or guardians. Many states have a provision for the appointment of a
temporary guardian, and it is simpler in some places than others. In some
states, a simple notarized letter would do, but in Pennsylvania this requires
a court proceeding and a fee of *several hundred dollars*! This means that
your Seneschal, etc. cannot generally do this thing. 
        If you (any unemancipated minor) shows up at Pennsic, chirurgeons
cannot treat you without risking their licenses and leaving themselves open to
lawsuits. Furthermore, a hospital emergency room cannot admit you or treat you
medically, except for basic life preservation. Such limited care may result in
your being maimed, disfigured, or disabled for life, and the Coopers would be
liable for all your losses for allowing you to be there in the first place.
The SCA is also potentially liable for the same reasons. 
        I'm sorry, but it doesn't matter whether you drink, raise hell, or
not. If that was a reason to deny entry to Pennsic, our overcrowding problems
would be solved, and I could camp on Tuchux hill! What does matter is that
while in Pennsylvania without your parents, you are basically a runaway, and
you cannot receive medical treatment because your parents might be Christian
Scientists, etc. I am truly sorry, but I only work here...

                                            In Service to Chirurgery,

Good gentles, please forgive me if some of my comments and additions seem a 
little out of date with what's going on with the Rialto.  I'm not on alt.sca,
and receive the Digests in a "bundle".  I promise that nothing here will have
cobwebs on it, though.
 
Mustapha mentioned a book of period games.  It was written by the Baron Beyond
the Mountain, Salaamallah the Corpulent, and some other people, and I believe
you can get it from the SCA Stock Clerk or from Raymond's Quiet Press.  Also,
Salaamallah did a Compleat Anachronist issue on gaming a few years ago, and you
can order a reprint from the Stock Clerk (see TI for a list).
 
If anyone else besides Lindorm Eriksson is interested in runic typefaces for
the Mac, let me know.
 
How to feed a fighter (Nicolette?): I guess the first thing you have to decide
is whether you want to cook AT ALL, not even hot water.  There are a number of
good things you can create just by adding hot water, such as instant oatmeal,
soups, and backpackers' meals (the last aren't very good, but they're certainly
convenient).  Also, the best outdoor meal I had recently was two hot sausages
wrapped in a big hunk of French bread.  You could do the same with cold cooked
kielbasa, but frying two sausages doesn't take much.
 
Here's my shopping list for what to feed people who are too tired to cook:
 
Instant Gatorade (our favorite period drink!)
Bananas (not exactly common in the Middle Ages, but they have lots of minerals
to replace the ones you've just lost)
Fruit (grapes are always popular, but apples and oranges are good)
Cheese
Cold cooked chicken
Summer sausage or kielbasa, or cooked ham
Bread -- I prefer a nice wholegrain loaf 'cause they keep longer
Cookies -- things like Digbie cakes keep well and are easy to make ahead of time
 
To Barony or Not to Barony (Awilda): Ooh, you are in a spot, aren't you?  I've
seen two would-be Barons in my "extensive" SCA lifetime, and neither one ever
really did get what he wanted.  The first time, the shire fell completely
apart over the issue.  The second time, everyone in the shire united and said
"No, we'd rather be a Province"... and the person who wanted to be Baron never
did lend much energy to a Provincial effort after that.  Funny about that, huh?
 
Until Provincial awards are listed in the Order of Precedence, I can't see any
reason to go Province unless you want more bureaucracy.  You have to have the
same slate of officers as a Barony, but you don't really get all that much in
return.  (Anyone in Mountain Freehold or Myrkfaelinn have a better-informed
opinion than mine?  Please tell me what life is like in a Province.)   
 
The people who live (or have lived) in Baronies are better able to tell you
the advantages and disadvantages thereof; I never have.  I'm admittedly biased
against forming a Barony because of the two cases of tin-hat fever I've already
seen, but lots of places do it and survive.  (Kale, Steffan, or anyone else
who's been around long enough: What do you remember about when Patri was made
Baron of Carolingia?)
 
As for communicating with the Crown: remember our long and drawn-out debate
on letters of dis-recommendation?  I believe that your writing the Crown about
your misgivings falls under the same topic.
 
On the whole, it sounds as though you would be best off staying a shire until
you all can come to a consensus about what you really want.  Best of luck.

Subject: Becoming a Barony

I'll bet that the prospect of becoming a barony has destroyed more
thriving shires than anything else. (The remnants of my original shire
are lying around somewhere east of here...)

I have two comments on the problems of becoming a barony.

The first is that there is no rule saying that once a shire becomes a
particular size, it *has* to become a barony. If enough people in the group
feel that it won't survive the process, you can *stay a shire*. It is,
after all, a better option than bad feelings and a broken shire.
(The Shire of Seagirt (Victoria, B.C.) has long had the population
necessary to become a Barony but prefers not to go through the hassle of
choosing a Baron and Baroness. They are quite proud to be An Tir's oldest
shire.)

The other comment I have is that the Baron and Baroness are the
representatives of the crown and as such are (technically) chosen by the
crown to represent them in the barony. (Gosh darn! I've left my Corpora at
home. If I get the following wrong, someone correct me.) In practice,
a Baron/ess is chosen by the residents of the barony and presented to the
crown as a *candidate*.  The crown has the right to reject or accept the
candidate.  So if there's a stalemate in the choice of candidates,
why not present them *all* to the crown and agree to go with whoever the
crown chooses? (Just a thought.)

Subject: Eating at Pennsic

Master Robyyan's comments about finding someone else to cook for you
remind me of my my favorite times at Pennsic, when I would round up
all the miscellaneous squires, etc, and promise to cook for everyone
in return for $1 per meal and help toting and fetching... I haven't
been able to do this in two years, what with pregnancy and whatnot,
but I hope to revive the Northmark Inn at some future time (but I
doubt I'll have Master Robyyan to kick around anymore, now that he's
married and gone away...)
 
At any rate, I work on cooking things that don't take a whole lot of
time but provide a lot of good nourishment. Breakfasts run the gamut
from sweetrolls to eggs and meat. Lots of OJ and other fruit juices.
I've become partial to oatmeal and cream of wheat, altho Robyyan
convinced me of the value of using the instant kind, and cleaning up
the pots from the long-cooking stuff reinforced that idea.
 
Lunches are usually available from 11 am to 3 pm, and consist of
some sort of roll and different varieties of lunch meats, cheeses,
fruits, etc. THis way the fighters and folks who are up and about
early can get their chow whenever they wan t, and the later risers
or brunchers can also get fed. Sandwiches mean I don't spend all day
over the stove, and can leave notes on what's available in case I
want to get out of camp for a bit. (My proudest moment over a lunch
came when a Western Duke of some repute "forgot" to eat breakfast
and got hit by the sun while over-doing it fighting, and I was able
to produce fruit and cheese and sandwiches for him while he
recuperated in the shade.)
 
DInners can be anything. With enough coolers and a grocery store
within 20 miles I can attempt anything, and usually do. I've done
chicken stir-fry in 3 different hot-nesses, massive pots of beef
stew, steaks, roast chicken, etc. The rules are: Start cooking about
4 pm, but don't expect people to be ready to eat before 8. (*this
works out really well, because everything takes longer to cook than
you'd expected, anyway.*) Make sure you have a lot of liquids on
hand -- not alchohol, but juices and lemonade and Coke and bottled
water. Remember that once the sun goes down it gets COLD, and these
folks will want a hot meal in the evening.
 
Try to get the dishes done before it gets dark.
 
Make someone else wash the dishes.
 
And, what bart and Robyyan will never believe, but which I've come
to believe myself very strongly in the last year: Make time to take
care of yourself. Make or let someone else cook at least one night
while you're there, and don't try to be perfect. Whatever you do
will be good enough.

Well, I've waited a seemly amount of time and it looks like no-one
else is going to tell you how our crown tourney went, so...

At the An Tir May Crown Tournament, held in the Barony of Lions Gate
(Vancouver, B.C.) on May 20-21, AS XXIV (1989), Sir Tjorkill Kanne won
the tourney for Companion Master Hlutwige Wolfkiller - defeating Duke
Sir Steingrim Stellari in the final round.

(Aside: Sir Tjorkill is male, Master Hlutwige is female.)

There were approximately 56 fighters in the lists.

All hail Their Highnesses, Tjorkill and Hlutwige!

 Re: No Minors at Pennsic(Without their parents.)

     Being a minor myself, I dislike this rule, or at least how I
may have inadvertantly mis-interpreted it.  I BELIEVE I noticed someone
say that it was Allready , or GOING to be put into practice that no
minors would be allowed at pennsic without their parent's accompaniment
...This Of Course depends on where you are living, and what you
consider a minor, being 17 I consider myself a minor.  If this is
true, I would not be allowed to attend pennsic.  Not that my parents
wouldn't enjoy a sweaty week miles from home surrounded by thousands
of people, who they would consider weird, It's just my parents AREN'T
members of the S.C.A., and have no interest in it what so ever!.
    I hope I've not totally mis-interpreted what ssomeone has said?
Though, personally, I won't actually be going for a year or two anyway
as I don't have the money/time.  I would assume that in a case like this
that a senechal, or other officer of the minor's Canton could act as a
temporary legal Gaurdian?  Would this not be more appropriate.  Though
of course, I can see both sides of the arguement, but I know it does not
apply in my case, as though I've brewed both Mead & Ale, I only drink
enough to taste how the batch has come out.  Personally, if I were
going to spend all the money to go down to pennsic, the time to go to it,
as well as suffering through the problems encountered in any mass
gathering of thousands of people, I would certainly not inebriate myself
to the point of intoxication, as it mean missing out on everything
happening around me.

        Personally, I find anyone who would do this, quite un-Adult.
Though, I can understand why some might want to do this, I think that
it would just ruin the reasons behind pennsic.  (Not to mention give the
S.C.A. a reputation of a bunch of milandering drunks!)


 *Sorry* my good gentles if i've inadvertantly offended any of thee
who make it a practice to get sloshed.

Subject: how other people do it
Message-ID:  <8905271516.aa03851@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

I don't particulary think of myself as a Civil War reenacter (American Civil
War for you Europeans), but well, I was with the Fifth Michigan Regiment Band
for five years, and we did do some big events, including camping events, so
here's how we did it:  Our parents sat on us.  I four parents weren't with us,
somebody else's parents sat on us.  We behaved ourselves, and were, when it was
felt occassion warranted, subjected to bed checks. You may be able to do this
to a hundred and fifty high schoolers, but I doubt five thousand partying grown
ups at Pennsic will stand for it.

The biggest  Civil War event I ever attended was Greenfiled Village
Muzzleloaders Festival, put on by the Henry Ford Museum.  About a thousand
participants would camp at the adjoining campground for the night, and would
walk up to the  Village for the day.  It was  about a mile walk to the
Village, and once you were in the Village, you could easily walk a mile and
ahalf if you were going some place far away, like the riverboat.  (And you
think Pennsic's big? *snicker* you ought to try marching for miles in a wool
uniform in 110 degree heat. We had a group of support people who followed
along behind us to pick up the bodies as they fell)

Greenfield Village dealt with the problems we've encountered in the following
way: The campground had no showers or toilets.  If you wanted em, you walked a
mile up to the dormitory.  If you were smart, you figured out the short cut
across the parade ground (where the shooting was done during the day) and it
was a lot quicker.  The dormitory had several barracks that participants could
use if they didn't want to camp.  Camping was free, I think the dormitory cost
a dollar a person a night.  Dormitory had not many toilets: whne people were
getting ready for the ball there was a line out the door just like you see at
Pennsic. But they were flush toilets, and they always worked (city sewers are
good for something). Showers were group showers, just like you had in high
school, or in the military. There weren't a lot of them.  Basically you didn't
take a shower unless you needed it.  You'd think after marching all day in
sweltering heat in uniform everybody would need it, Henry Ford didn't see it
that way.  Nobody complained.  It was accepted as the normal course of events.

Behaviour problems:  No alcohol allowed on site, period.  You could drink
discreetly, but not many people did.  If you were seen violating the rule by
camp security they would politely inform you of the rule and wait for you to
pour out your drink.  If you were inebriated they would politely offer to walk
you to your tent.  You were not allowed to say no.  If it seemed to be a
serious problem, they would take your name and group affiliation and call up
whoever was head of your group-bandmaster, parents, colonel, whoever.  And that
person was gotten out of bed to to come collect you and explain to the camp
security why you should not be put on a bus and sent home.  And they did put
people on busses and send them home.  It happened to an underage drinker who
got totally wasted who was part of  our group.  And if there were several
people from your group who were problems, your group could be put on probation,
and if that wasn't adequate, they would tell your group to leave.  And they
would bar you from ever participating again.  This rarely happened.  If a group
got put on probation the people who were enjoying the event and behaving
themselves made darn sure the trouble makers stayed out of trouble.

the public: The public was invited, nay encouraged to attend.  They paid
something like seven dollars for the day, or could buy a weekend pass.  There
was a clear distinction between those who were participating, and those who
were watching.  Particpants were in costume, public was not.  Public was
ushered out at the end of the day. Certain facilities were labled "Participants
only"  These were changing rooms, some restrooms, some prep areas.  

Greenfield Village handled about as many people for Muzzleloaders as Pennsic
handles.  But I don't think they had anymore flush tiolets on site that the
Coopers have.  And they only brought in a few portapotties for congested areas
(the parade ground, which was the center of activities).  And there was no
first aid, each group brought their own medical officer.  And there was no
store, unless you went into town.  And no laundry, check cashing, or other
service.  you got a place to lay your head, period.  And this is a large, well
respected museum witha lot more bucks than the SCA.

Other places I went were pretty much like SCA events 50-250 people was the
normal turn out.  Because shooting guns was involved, they were invariably
camping events. Showers were rare luxuries.  Swimming holes were non-existant.
Tiolets ranged from a three hole pit privy to a cinder block outhouse with
flush toilets, three each for men and women.  When new people experessed dismay
about the lack of showers, old people told them, "So what.  You don't need to
shower this weekend. Don't worry, everybody else will smell just the same."

I think Pennsic is wonderfully well equipped!

The trouble with Pennsic facilities is many people come to Pennsic who never
camp any other time, and they expect the same amenities they get in a hotel, or
at home.  Sorry folks, it ain't so.

I have also been involved in orgainizing other things such as Howell Challenge
Balloon Festival, and have seen other things being organized (my mother was on
the board of the Chamber of Commerce for our town.)  A rule that the Chamber of
Commerce decided to adopt was: NO ALCOHOL.  They had formerly had a beer tent
to raise money.  As problems increased, they decided to forgo the income in
order to keep their events safe and family oriented.  Drinking in public was
not allowed (people had started bring six packs to the free concert on the
lawn).  A lot of people were upset about this.  They were told they could drink
at home if they wanted to, but if they were drunk or drinking in public, it
would not be tolerated.  And they did something clever: they got the National
Guard to handle parking.  That's all the Guard did, they were not responsible
for security or anything.  But with a bunch of guys with MP on their armbands
wandering around, it helped people behave.

There are a lot of things that happen at Pennsic.  A lot of people go there
because it's CARNIVAL and I can do anything I want! The only way to change this
is to prohibit or restrict certain kinds of behaviour.  No minors without
parents is one such rule that's already been implemented.  No public purveying
of alcohol is  a rule that may or may not be implemented. 

And I hate to suggest it, but strict control of alcohol may be the only way to
control some of the undesirable behaviour that occurs.  Another thing that
would help would be a VERY visible security force.  I don't know what Pennsic
security does use as an emblem, which shows it isn't very visible.  Something
like a black tabard with a argent mailed fist would get the idea across.  And
signs ought to be put up Explaining what the emblem means, and indicating where
the nearest guardpost was.  And security could do things like they do in other
places, such as picking up drunks and taking them home if they can figure out
where they live, or dropping them off at the chirurgeons if not. People with a
problem would be able to find security to help them this way.  

And now I can hear the people screaming in protest.  But it is coming to this.

  If you are not into opening cans and heating their contents as a way
to get hot food at an SCA camping event, you can try this trick (apologies
to whomever I picked it up from; I can't remember who you are):
  Cook a stew or soup at home ahead of time and freeze it in convenient
quantities.  Use your frozen food as the ice for your cooler for the first
couple of days.  When the frozen food gets near thawed, buy more ice and
heat up the frozen food.
  This technique supplied me and 2-3 others with dinner for a couple of
days at Pennsic 5-6 years ago.

Subject: Laurel apprenticeship

Gentles:

A possibly late comment on the recent discussion on Laurel apprentices/
associates/squires (fill in your own term).  I have been apprenticed to a 
Laurel for close to two years.  I did not enter this relationship with the 
hopes or intentions of ever becoming a Master of the Laurel myself, rather to
try to become the best dancer I possibly could.  Under my liege's guidence, I 
beleive my skill has improved.  By taking me as an apprentice, the Laurel 
provided me with a concrete example of skill to strive for.  Further, the 
nature of the apprentice/master relationship often goes further than the 
art or science in question.  Much of the Society's greatness is from the
tradition of honorable service, both to groups and to individuals.  This is one
way which I choose to live in the Society.

On the vexing question of barony vs province; Lady Orianna puts quite
neatly the difference in the question of baronial status vs the
baron/ess individual.  Having lived both in a province that went
sour (and eventually folded) as well as a Barony that flourished
and survived transitions from one set of hats to another -- and
knowing of others who also survived, IMHO bad politics between
persons is not limited to brass-hatism (pun intended 8-}).  Baron/esses
_have_ _no_ _power_, except to poison an atmosphere, it takes the
seneshal to really mess up a group into dissolution.  At least that
was what ended up factionalizing the former province.  It should
be possible to allow that delightful english statement [Her Majesties
_Loyal_ Opposition] in a Barony.  If the person(s) selected cannot
produce people willing to say that they are their Baron/ess'
loyal (!) opposition in that the populace has people who may oppose
this or that thing the civil service attempts, then the selected individual
should not wear said brass hat.  Should the above situation arise,
then the truly loyal Baron/ess (loyal to the populace) will gently
step down.

This is a suggestion in response to Orianna's posting "Thank you
Marion"  Those of us who are dedicated to the society, or some aspect of it 
tend to send tribute to California each year.  Our little yellow cards
do seem to indicate a certian level of interest in the SCA.  For 
the not so large sum of $6 per year, couln't a MEMBERSHIP in the society
be a factor in controling the numbers of those not interested in 
any part of the SCA, except for the parties at Pennsic?  I realize that
I may be disturbing a hornets nest, but I know of no other society
or association that does not require or suggest membership in 
exchange for privileges and/or benefits.  Of course, a tightly 
enforced bureaucracy wouldn't do. (So, if your membership lapsed in May
and you haven't got your new card yet, you could still attend Pennsic.)
If a person can afford a weeks worth of camping fees and related
expenses, he or she could certianly afford Associate Membership.
Planning ahead can not be too difficult, most people do have to schedule
vacations from work, etc.  For that rare new person who gets involved in 
the early summer and really wants to go to the war, perhaps correspondence
with the autocrat, or other designated person, would be allowed. Or a
letter of introduction from a baron, etc. or senechale.  Or maybe 
new people might have to wait til next year.  This last point 
will be a problem until policy is set-I don't pretend to have 
the issue sewn up into a nice, neat package.  The worse that can
happen is that no net effect will be felt at Pennsic-everyone
will become members, and the "problems" will still exist.  But
the Society as whole will benefit from the revenus and expanded
official membership base.

(my apologies if this is a duplicate -- I couldn't remember if I sent it
once already)
My Lady,

You seem to imply that becoming a Baron or Baroness (when I use Baron/ess
in this message, I mean strictly Landed Titles!) is something that should
be given as a reward for working hard for a group.  Unfortunately, that has
been the downfall of a lot of *Founding* Barons or Baronesses.  Because
they were the big movers and shakers in their group, they were chosen as
the ideal first Baron/ess.  Then, when their egos got in the way of the
good of the group, nasty things happened.

What you need for a Baron/ess is someone (or two someones) who everyone
gets along with, everyone agrees are good workers, and are generally
well-liked.  Also someone who can arbitrate a dispute, negotiate, and is
good at diplomacy.  Someone who takes the responsibilities of being the
Crown's representative to the Barony, and the Barony's representative to
the Crown, seriously.  Someone who will recognize people for doing good
work, for helping the Barony in whatever way their talents allow, and for
creating an even (yet fun) environment for the group.  Someone who won't
let the tin hat go to their head, yet feels that the duty of the hat far
outweighs the actual tonage of the pretty metal bonnet with pearls.
Someone who, when they think of that person, people outside the Barony will
have a good impression and will value for their opinion, becuase your
Baron/ess *is* your group.  They are the visible and physical manifestation
of your group and will determine to a large extent the perceptions others
have of your group.

I must admit, the most "successful" Barons and Baronesses that I have met
are ones that are generally well-liked by the majority of the group.  They
may not be the hardest workers, the most charismatic leaders, or the most
vocal.  The last thing your group needs on such a momentous change is
someone who will take the hat and the power (what there is -- and they only
have as much as you give them) right to their heads!

Good luck.  I hope that this helps.

Disclaimer:  This is my own opinion based on observations of other groups
and their respective figureheads.  I welcome differing observations only!

From: Orilee_J_Ireland-Delfs.wbst845@xerox.com
Message-ID: <890525-023549-11678@Xerox>

I would like to thank Marion for her reasonable, common sense response to
the Pennsic uproar.  I admit to a certain amount of "panic" myself, but her
calm statements certainly cooled me off.

One of my arguments to people who have expressed the desire to find another
site for Pennsic has been --only if you can find someone who will support
4,000+ people the way the Coopers have.  How many other campgrounds have or
can access the mundane support people that the Coopers can?  Think of all
the background activities that go into Pennsic: cleaning the portacastles
on a regualr basis, supplying them with the necessary consumables, cleaning
the permanent bathhouses and supplying them, providing the ability to cash
checks, purchase certain necessities (popsicles!), supply and deliver the
haybales for the archery field and bridge battles, provide the haywanes for
the camp bus, provide the go-carts for the chirurgeons, etc.  I think I
could go on, but you get the idea.

My next question would be, if the SCA purchases a permanent Pennsic (and
other events) site, who is going to supply/support/purchase all of that?
How many SCA gentles are willing to spend *their* Pennsic cleaning
portacastles?  (Of course, it makes for great punishment, but soon everyone
would be too good and the portacastles wouldn't get cleaned, ....or the
person in charge today had to get his armor inspected and couldn't get to
the job on time... you see the problems inherent in this.)

I think that those of us who remember the smaller wars need to  readjust
our mind set to deal with a larger war.  We have certain set ways that
simply won't work with a bigger war, and we need to readjust to go along.
Personnally, I can't think of any way to decrease the size of the war,
unless it would be to set a limit on the number of people who camp and
require advance reservations (not for camping space, but for the privilege
of camping).  Anyone who doesn't make reservations either doesn't come or
has to stay someplace else and day-trip in.  I certainly haven't heard any
of these complaints about TYC or the Argent Anniversary, and they deal with
double or triple the number of attendees.

I agree with Maestra Niccola to a certain extent:  I wish there were some
way to keep the folks who come to Pennsic just to party and have a good
time in a place that doesn't care if you are under age and drunk every
night.  Restricting the under age to being accompanied by a parent will do
it in part (although I still don't agree with it for other reasons), we
still have a group of people coming to Pennsic who have no inherent
interest in the SCA at all, make only a passing stab at garb because they
have to, and are a threat to our enjoyment of the event (just one
unfortunate incident could put more restrictions on the event.  In the SCA,
we have a certain recourse to punishing those members of the SCA who cause
us harm (us as in the SCA has an entity), but if they aren't members, what
choices do we have?)

I would like to know how other recreation groups deal with this.  Is it
because other groups are stricter about the recreation aspects of their
organizations that they automatically weed out those who aren't interested
in the group?

I'm sorry this got so long.  I will shut up now and let you all continue
on.  Thank you for your patience in reading this!

Someone from Myrkfaelinn may beat me to this, but...

Myrkfaelinn is a Dominion (the only one in the Known World that I know of).
It is the size of a Barony but has no titular head and does not give
awards.  It is a unique phenomenon within the East Kingdom.  Since it is
not my place to spread the tale of Myrkfaelinn, I will let someone from
that fair land do so instead (if they so wish).  (Myrkfaelinn was my first
introduction to the SCA, which may say something about my view on life).

Nicollette Bonhomme asks about easy camping food for fighters that
don't have energy to cook at the end of the day.  Some ideas that
Fern and I have used:
  hard cooked eggs (prepared ahead at home) - peel and eat
  cold vegetable pieces (wash, peel, chop, etc. ahead at home)
  cold cooked chicken (cook ahead at home)
    (you could do other meats too, but I don't eat meat that came
     from 4 legged animals, so we don't do it)
   cheese hunks
   good bread - not Wonder, but something solid and unsliced, preferably
      whole grain of some kind
   sandwiches (many can be prepared at home)
   quiche or other kinds of pie to be eaten cold (prepare at home)
You'll notice that almost all of these require some planning ahead,
and preparation at home before you go to the event.  They should
all keep quite well in an ice chest for a couple of days without
any problem.

Preparing hot food is somewhat more trouble, especially if you want
something more in our period than opening a can and heating it.
But there are lots of soups and stews that can be started either
at home and heated on site, or started in the morning and left to
simmer all day.  We tend to not want to do much cooking, and usually
opt for one of the cold selections listed above.  The biggest hint
is to plan your menu ahead of time, and prepare as much as you can
in the week before the event at home in the comfort of your own
kitchen.

Of course, another plan is to find someone who likes to cook while
camping that doesn't fight, and arrange a deal with them.  Something
like "I'll buy the groceries if you'll cook dinner for us"... :-)

On the topic of meeting at Pennsic:
The last posting I recall said that we would meet Friday for a
cocktail hour from 6:30 to 7:30 or so.  We would decide where later,
when people had a better idea of what size encampments they would
have, and Arval (at the Herald's Point) would be a pointer to where
we will be.  There was no further comment, so I guess thats what
we'll do.  Is it later enough to discuss where yet, or should we
wait a bit longer?

Here's a nugget of Myrkfaelinn history from Arval (I had heard snips of
it, but not the whole thing):                         -Gwdaiuwen
----------------------------Original message----------------------------

Oh, I thought you'd know.

When Myrkfaelinn was borne, it was still traditional (and indeed,
required in law) for each new shire to swear fealty to the Crown of
the East.  The King at that time was Asbjorn.  Since the primordial
Myrkies were all Old Norse students, they wanted to hold the ceremony
in Old Norse, to which request Asbjorn agreed.  The ceremony was
conducted in Norse, the charter was signed in Norse, and the fealty
was sworn in Norse...with one catch: Myrkfaelinn swore fealty not to
the Crown of the East, but to Asbjorn, King of the East. (Note:
Asbjorn still remembers this ceremony with a chuckle, and was pleased
ot hear that we do, too!)  This has been the basis of many of the
standard Myrkie claims not to be obliged to have anything to do with
the East.  On the other hand, if Asbjorn ever shows up, Master John
has vowed that he will fight for him, no matter who he's fighting
with.  Myrkfaelinn as a whole should feel the same.

So...if Asbjorn DOES show up, he should be treated as Myrkfaelinn's
overlord, and treated royally.

Subject: Lyme Plague


Unto the good gentles of the Rialto Li Kung Lo sends greetings! As the season
of camping events (and Pennsic) is upon us, I would like to call the attention
of all and sundry to a very real plague that is sweeping the knowne world, and
offer some advice on the prevention of this crippling disease.
        Lyme disease, named after Lyme, Conn., where it was first identified,
is caused by a microorganism called a spirochete, and transmitted by the bite
of an infected tick. It is most common in the Northeast, the upper Midwest,
and the Pacific states, but has been reported in 43 states. The tick that
transmits the disease in the East and Midwest is called Ixodes dammini, and is
about the size of a pinhead, although it may enlarge several times when
engorged with blood. In their early life stages, they live mostly on mice, in
the intermediate stage, on medium sized beasts ( skunk, raccoon, possum, cats,
dogs, etc.), and in its adult stage lives mostly on deer, but they like humans
a lot.
        Being so small, you may not even know you have been bit, and the
disease can be very difficult to diagnose. If you get the disease, symptoms
may not appear until days or even weeks after. This beastie is most common in
June and July, especially in New York and New England. Here follows a list of
signs and symptoms, and then some advice on how to protect yourself:

Warning Signs:
1) A rash, especially one in a ring or "bulls-eye" shape around the site of a
bite. This may appear days to weeks after a bite, but not in all cases.
2)chills, fever, headache, dizziness, fatigue, stiff neck. These are flu-like
symptoms, but in this case are likely to occur without the respiratory
symptoms often associated with the flu.
3) Swelling and pain in joints, especially the knees. This can lead to
arthritis and irreversible joint damage (wheelchairs, etc.)
4) somewhat less common- weakness in legs, facial paralysis and numbness.
(these neurological effects may also be permanent and irreversible)
5) a variety of cardiac arrythmias.

        If you've got this kind of stuff, see a doctor now! Better to waste a
few bucks on a blood test than live with long term IV antibiotic therapy and
permanent disability. Are we scared yet? This is a hard disease to prevent,
but there are some things you can do that will improve your odds:

1)Put a tick collar on your cat or dog, and change it when it is worn out. If
they go outside, check them out visually for ticks. Don't let them on your
furniture and don't sleep with them. Your cat or dog can also get Lyme Plague,
with all the same lovely symptoms, and the Vet bills can be quite high.
2)Avoid tall grass and low brush as much as possible.
3) Visually inspect your body for ticks when you have been outdoors or before
bed at camp. Look for moving freckles. If you find a tick, grasp it with
tweezers as close to the mouth as possible and gently pull it off. (Note for
old-time medics- Fire and oil are passe techniques. If you want to know why,
ask me about it sometime.)
4) Wear tightly woven fabrics that cover as much of you as possible, and when
feasible, tuck your pants into your boots. (I *know* this is incompatible with
lots of garb)
5) Always wear an insect repellent containing DEET (most of them), and for
extra protection, spray your clothing with permethrin(sold as Permanone). For
nice garb, test a swatch first.
6) Wherever possible, shower after exposure to brush, or at least before going
to bed.
7) Never wear sandals or go barefoot outdoors.

        Believe me, I know just what a pain all of this is, but so is Lyme
plague. If you can't do it all, at least try to do what you can live with. The
number of confirmed cases is increasing geometrically. Good luck and good
health to all.

                                        
                                        In Service to the Society,

Message-ID:  <8905251323.aa01510@mintaka.lcs.mit.edu>

Another helpful hint from Mistress Niccola... Orlando
---
A further, and important, addition to the helpful hints for making the
objects of the Middle Ages.

MAKE FULL SCALE WORKING DRAWINGS BEFORE YOU START

Full size. Two or more views for 3-D objects. With details of the tricky
parts.

If you have ever been surprised (or disappointed) by the size or shape of
a finished artifact, you should find it easy to take this advice to
heart. If you have never been surprised, you either already make working
drawings or you are not evaluating your own work critically enough when
you're finished.

Your brain informs your hands. Whatever idea you have in your head about
an artifact is going to come out through your hands. If your idea about a
helmet is of a large round object, you are going to make a large round
helmet, even if you hoped you were going to make a gracefully curving,
sharply crested barbute.

It is not surprising if your ideas about medieval objects are not just
like the real ones. After all, you live amongst furniture made of
skinny, straight-sided sticks set at right angles to each other, you
drive cars that look like somebody chopped the last foot off them, and
every year the fashion designers pick new colors for you to look at.
Naturally, you are not going to share the Gothic esthetic. And if you
aren't careful, you are going to make an object that looks as much like
1989 as it does like 1389.

Your drawings are your opportunity to find out what's in your head and to
adjust it. (Fortunately, you are likely to draw the same thing you're
likely to make.) Draw your project out full scale. (If it has to fit on
some part of your body, like your head, get somebody to trace around you,
then draw the object right over the tracing.) Your drawing really should
contain enough detail so that you do not have to consult your references
while you are actually at work on the project. Not that it ever works out
that way.

Look at your drawing. Look at your photographs and photocopies and
sketches of the real thing- the medieval examples. Correct your drawings.
Leave them for a day. Look again. Correct again. Get somebody else to
look at them. Correct again.

By the time you have finished a series of comparisons and corrections,
you will have a better drawing and, more important, a better idea about
the object you want to make. And, because you have compared it to your
examples of medieval artifacts in the planning stages of your work, it
will be a lot closer to those examples than if you had leapt in convinced
that you knew what you were doing.


The most important benefit of making working drawings is internalizing a
medieval esthetic about a specific object. There are, however, other
benefits as well:

You can solve problems of construction on paper which would be time-
consuming and frustrating to solve in your costly materials or on your
carefully-made piece. What joint will you use? In what order must the
pieces be assembled? Where will you place the hinges? Can you finish the
seam without ruining the garment?

Your drawings also give you something to compare your piece to as you're
working. Hammer a little, pick up your helmet, hold it up to the drawing
and compare the curve at the back of the head. Because your drawings are
full scale, it is easy to do.

Your working drawings with the the details of construction and the
dimensions and so forth will, finally, save your project if (heaven
forbid) you put it away long enough to forget what you're doing. I took
down a project last month that I hadn't touched in five years and found
myself with grossly inadequate plans, a half-built hurdy-gurdy, and a
half-dozen carefully shaped pieces I still can't identify.

Make the drawings. It's hard to admit you're not perfect and can't just
make a thing out of your head , but it's a lot harder to work with only
the vaguest notion of what you're doing.

Message-ID:  <8905251250.aa13539@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>


My thanks to the gentles who have responded to the question of becoming a
province or a barony. The suggestion of a limited period for baron is a good
one, and one I support.  But people have also pointed out two flaws: We can
then fight about who gets to be "Founding Baron/ess"  and then every two years
we can fight about who gets to be baron this time.  Which I think is likely to
happen, the core people in the shire are survivors from  a nasty break up of a
larger group several years ago.  

Now I pose the second question,  What do I tell the royalty when they want to
know who I favor for baron and why?  Both canidates have good points and bad
points.  Do I discuss the bad along with the good?  I think that in at least
one matter the negative is important, and has a serious disqualifying effect.

To: Mistress Cher de Bellvue, Barony of An Crosaire, Kingdom of Trimaris
    ( claris!ames!mailrus!uflorida!CRF%gnv.ifas.ufl.edu )

UNTO THE MOST NOBLE MISTRESS CHER de BELLVUE are sent the most earnest
and sincere greetings of Ld Jhanos shaKhan al Carin, of the Shire of
Starhaven, Kingdom of Trimaris.

I pray you wouldst here my plea, and respond in the affirmative as it be
your wish.

We have a common friend, Mistress Mistress Baroness Baroness Atalaya la
Sanadora, of the honoured Shire of Gleann Duhb. I prithee to attend this
request, as Her Redundency has, in most probability, issued an order to
the house guard for my immediate harm! HerSelf had, as can be documented,
issued an order for all in attendence to "mess with him", meaning myself.
As I, only in appearance of course, have ignored Her Adaquacies requests
to attend the House of Phour Pheons, ALTHOUGH, I have a very good reason
for my untimely departure from the Known World.

If you wouldst be kind enough to forward the attached message, I would
be forever indebted to your kindness.

In Service to Trimaris and the Dream...

Jhanos

Subject: A little more regarding barony

Unto the gentles ethereal does Ellethel send greetings!

Seeing some of the other responses regarding Awilda Halfdane's query about
going barony or province, I found I have a few brief additional remarks to
make. First, in Dawnfield we did not consider very much the possibility of
baron/ess with limited term of office and periodic elections. Depending on
the mood of your group this could be a solution; or, it could just lead to
infighting around every election. One problem it does not resolve is who
gets the title Founding Baron/ess, which goes to the first baron/ess of a
new barony. Perhaps this could be resolved by having both a baron and a
baroness, at least for the first term (you're lucky the two candidates have
opposite gender (please don't bring up the issue of same sex co-barons :-)).

Another observation I would make is that my understanding is that the
Province of Ostgardr is a special case in their having a Viceroy and
Vicereine (sp?). The Viceroy/reine rule the capital of the kingdom on behalf
of their Majesties. Other provinces, such as Mountain Freehold and
Myrkfaelinn (sp?) have no Viceroy or other baron substitute, and are run
only by a seneschal. This does not prevent their giving awards, but my
impression is that it is rather less medieval, but those groups seem happy
with their arrangements. I would agree with the sentiment that what matters
is that the group still be able to pull together and work together, no
matter who wears a tin hat, if anyone.

The best maxim I have found for SCA participation (not at all original): If
it isn't fun, don't do it.

Well, I've said my piece and will try to avoid further postings even
approaching a political nature.

Nicolette Bonhomme
sends all good greetings unto
the visitors to the Rialto

     For many of us, the season for camping events is just beginning.
This is one of my favorite aspects of the Society.  This summer is
likely to be different for me, though, as I am beginning heavy list.
Can other campers on the Rialto make good suggestions for no-muss,
no-fuss period food?  What can be made ahead of time?  What requires
the least amount of preparation on site? The other person I'll be
traveling with is also a fighter, and I suspect neither of us will have
any extra energy at the end of the day for cooking.

     If people wish to send directly to me, I can summarize the results
for the general populus.  Thank you!

     Also, what happened to the discussion about meeting at the Pensic
War?  It appears that so many people are doing so many different things
that we might benefit from an early-evening "cocktail hour" get-together
directly after dinner but before any other parties/meetings/etc. get under
way.  This would allow even those with prior commitments to show their
faces, as it were.  I believe that it be a fine thing to meet you all,
and am looking forward to it.

                                        In service to the barony,

B'Shem HaShem HaRachmon. Unto the gentles of the Rialto may this missive find
you in good health and spirits. MaAyt shel- Yonatan of the too long name.

I must apologize for the screw up in a recent digest. The general bibliography
I sent was supposed to cover two digests, but through an error in lag time
came out in one. This was an inexcusable misuse of space that could have
been used for better purposes and I truly apologise.
In several not so distantly past digests several individuals had voiced
concern in their ability/desire to create period names and persona. This
was and is an all too frequent problem and the references I sent to the
digest were my attempt to aid the Society in general and these people in
particular. Richard DeLacy suggests, quite rightly, that e-mail is more
apropriate for responses to these problems. In my zeal to assist I bored
Richard (and undoubtedly several others). Be assured that I will refrain from
inflicting such damage again, and I thank him for letting me know. My
name is long in the opening as is period for my persona, just call me
Yonatan if you prefer. The name is mine and the whole mess does appear as
written on my birth certificate. Did make picking a persona easy....

Kale says hi.

Tim the B.O.D.E. asks about commentary at tournaments, to make the
fighting comprehensible and therfore interesting to non-fighters.

In Carolingia, we discovered we had this sort of problem.  Specifically,
we have an annual tourney where the ladies of the barony choose a Ladies'
Champion for the year, based on the quality of fighting that day.  It
transpired that most of the newer ladies, and quite a few of the older
ones - oops, I mean longer-time members - didn't know good fighting from
bad and so didn't watch the fighting much and so didn't know how to choose
a Champion.  As a former Ladies' Champion myself, and a Deputy Knight
Marshal charged with making fighting more interesting to more people, I
tried to think of something.

At the beginning of a tournament I would get a couple of experienced
fighters together, have a herald draw people's attention, and go over
some basics of SCA combat: "This is a killing blow." (bong!) "This is
a tip shot: it connects, but doesn't kill." (ding!) "Here's how you
block: it's how you don't get killed." (whack!)  And so on for five
minutes or so, showing hook shots, feints, combinations, a couple
different weapons forms.  At the end, the fighters fight two *quick*
bouts, one "good" (fast well-aimed blows, fancy-looking combinations,
showing courtesy to the opponent) and one "bad" (rhino-hiding, grappling,
lots of knee shots - the fighters always have fun with this).  The idea
is to keep it short, and give them enough exposure that they can ask
intelligent questions later if they're interested.

We try to do this twice a year at least: before the first tourney in the
fall, to introduce the new crop of recruits (Boston is a big
college town, we have at least four active college groups at any one
time, and recruiting demos make up a major chunk of our fall calendar),
and before the Ladies' Champion Tourney in the spring, since the fighting
is to be judged by a lot of ladies who have never judged fighting before.
This practice has received some very favourable feedback.

I rather like Tim's idea, to take this further and provide running
pre- and post-bout commentary during the tourney.  The only drawbacks I
can foresee are: the difficulty of getting a fighter experienced enough
to provide good commentary who's willing to sit out that day, and the
feeling of tying people down who might want to go do something else.
(Like what?  See Cariadoc's answer to Ragnar Thorburgsson's original 
question.)  But I think I'm going to try it sometime.

Has anyone else tried things like this?  Things unlike this?

Message-Id: <612025021/kee@A.NL.CS.CMU.EDU>

While I agree with Richard that the story of Michael of Boarshaven was
very interesting (and makes a good cautionary tale, too) I must
disagree with his position that the bibliography placed on the Rialto
by Yonatan was an inappropriate post.  That was hard Arts and Sciences
information, easy to page past if you weren't interested (it was REALLY
easy to scan and see where it ended, due to its special format), and in
my opinion it was a legitimate use of this forum.  Select bibliographies 
really pack a lot of bang (information) for the buck (space) and ought to 
be encouraged (though not necessarily as a matter of everyday posts.)

I agree that it could have been a better option to advise of its availability 
and then mail privately, but that's really a judgement call.  I don't think 
it was unreasonable to post it, because it wasn't that long (compared to, 
say, some of the endless hand-wringers on the subject of Pennsic) and it was 
easy to scan past it.  That's precisely the kind of information that
students of the Arts and Sciences need.  I hope all you local MoA/S's
out there will grab it off the net (whether or not you are personally
thrilled by Islamic studies), print it out, give copies to your local 
Near Eastern personae, and keep a copy in your files in case someone
comes to you for help on that topic later.

I suspect that one of the reasons Yonatan felt that the Michael of
Boarshaven story was best sent privately is that it was so painful to
live through for the people who were there, and touches on matters of
personal honor.  However, it's been so long since it happened, and it
makes such a good fable, that I think it was good that Tim posted it.
I see that my position in this regard is very much like Richard's and
hope he will forgive me for disagreeing on the bibliography-posting
issue.  (My name only has 5 syllables too, and it's not even in any
furrin tongue.  However, if Richard would like to try more syllables I
am sure that Lord Arval will sell him some, cheap! ;-)

Subject: on becoming a Barony
From: Orilee_J_Ireland-Delfs.wbst845@xerox.com
Message-ID: <890524-095111-9069@Xerox>

My Lady,

You seem to imply that becoming a Baron or Baroness (when I use Baron/ess
in this message, I mean strictly Landed Titles!) is something that should
be given as a reward for working hard for a group.  Unfortunately, that has
been the downfall of a lot of *Founding* Barons or Baronesses.  Because
they were the big movers and shakers in their group, they were chosen as
the ideal first Baron/ess.  Then, when their egos got in the way of the
good of the group, nasty things happened.

What you need for a Baron/ess is someone (or two someones) who everyone
gets along with, everyone agrees are good workers, and are generally
well-liked.  Also someone who can arbitrate a dispute, negotiate, and is
good at diplomacy.  Someone who takes the responsibilities of being the
Crown's representative to the Barony, and the Barony's representative to
the Crown, seriously.  Someone who will recognize people for doing good
work, for helping the Barony in whatever way their talents allow, and for
creating an even (yet fun) environment for the group.  Someone who won't
let the tin hat go to their head, yet feels that the duty of the hat far
outweighs the actual tonage of the pretty metal bonnet with pearls.
Someone who, when they think of that person, people outside the Barony will
have a good impression and will value for their opinion, becuase your
Baron/ess *is* your group.  They are the visible and physical manifestation
of your group and will determine to a large extent the perceptions others
have of your group.

I must admit, the most "successful" Barons and Baronesses that I have met
are ones that are generally well-liked by the majority of the group.  They
may not be the hardest workers, the most charismatic leaders, or the most
vocal.  The last thing your group needs on such a momentous change is
someone who will take the hat and the power (what there is -- and they only
have as much as you give them) right to their heads!

Good luck.  I hope that this helps.

Disclaimer:  This is my own opinion based on observations of other groups
and their respective figureheads.  I welcome differing observations only!

Message-Id: <89May24.161450edt.5271@gpu.utcs.utoronto.ca>

To Lord Ragnar of (Kitchener).  Most of the suggestions I would have
made about non-fighting activities have been made already.  I
suggestion about scheduling that I learned from last Hare.  If you
do run other activities, try not to let people book themselves for
more than one thing, ie. EITHER  troll OR kitchen OR fighting OR
quest OR Games OR child care--but not in several places, even if
the events are nominally spaced two hours apart.  Various things
will conspire to trash the schedule, and you want to avoid a small
group of people trying to people in multiple places at the same time.
Also make sure to have more than one floater, and at least one aide-de-
autocrat.  (Avoid having your spouse/posslq/best friend be any of these
things, and whatever you expect this person to do, ask them specifically
and don't assume...)
 
One more thing: Feast of the Hare is traditionally (for 11 years now)
the Saturday closest  to Remembrance Day.  It is booked for Saturday
November 11/89 in Skraeling (Ottawa, Ontario).  Crown Tourney is
booked for Oct 28 in Trinovantia (London, Ontario).
 
It would be easier for our people to attend your event,
and we would consider it a great courtesy,
if you would schedule your event for the latter part
of November.  (Last year Trinovantia held an event in this timeslot,
I believe- but there are no traditional events in the latter part of
November that I know of.)
 
Vale!

Greetings!  A resident of our fair Shire was interested in your request

to send it to your e-mail address, but there seems to be some difficulty

Greetings unto Owain of Shrewsbury from Erin Widfare of the Shire of
Isenfir,

This is my first time using e-mail, so please bear with me!
I am using our Seneschale's account (Jean Cooper, jlc5f@virginia.edu).
I also have a Welsh persona, and am greatly interested in any
information you or any other gentles can give me.  What part of
Wales are you from?  I just realized that 'information' is not very
specific.  Life, language,good literature, info on Caernarfon/
Anglesey, Welsh sailors/trading, things like that.
  My teacher, who also has a Welsh persona, is also interested in

The Crown Province of Ostgardr is unlike other provinces in that it has a
titular head, the Viceroy and Vicerene.  The Province of the Mountain Freehold,
for example, has no such office.

Provinces are far more common in other kingdoms - the East has just those 2.

Subject: Going Barony

In response to Awilda Halfdane's remarks concerning her group's possible
advancement to barony status:

Dear lady, some four years or so ago I was a member of an exciting and
rapidly growing shire in central Pennsylvania called Dawnfield. The group
split down the middle on whom they supported for baron. It was very messy
and ended up causing a number of people to leave the Society, probably
permanently, and the group has now splintered into three separate shires
(Dawnfield, Blak Rose, and Silver Rhyll (I hope the spelling is correct)).
Fortunately, I moved away at that time and avoided additional personal pain,
but it was still very painful from a distance to see ones friends destroy
each other.

I saw a similar thing happen when the Baroness of Settmour Swamp decided to
retire. There was vying for her successor, which caused deep ill feelings
between several ladies, and a number of folks still play mostly other games
(MSR). Settmour Swamp resolved the issue by keeping their baron but having
no baroness.

These things eventually blow over, but they take years, and it is very
distressing to the parties directly involved or those who know them
personally. On this point I stand firm: a group should not go barony unless
there is a single obvious candidate. Province is, of course a different
option, though it does eliminate the fun of baronial pageantry and court.

The problem I have outlined is by no means unique. A related problem, that
kingdom seneschals have assured me is quite common, is for a new barony to
end up with baron/ess-seneschal wars, because the new baron/ess was probably
a long time group seneschal used to running things and is not prepared to
let someone else do it and make their own mistakes.

Perhaps it would be useful for the group to gather and have a discussion of
these matters (you'll have to judge whether it would be worthwhile). You
really need strong consensus -- majority alone will not do.

Yours in seeking the dream ---

      Well, although this will probably arrive long after most of the
 discussion on this topic has passed, I will still add my 2 pence since
 they were asked of me...
      I have no direct experience with living in a Province.  However, I
 have lived (and still do) in two Baronies, one in Calontir, and one in the
 East, and it seems to me that living in a Barony gives ME more of the
 flavor of being in the Middle Ages.  Having one or two people who can
 represent the group in a medieval setting enhances the magic of the SCA.
 I truly cannot imagine living in an SCA group that functioned like the
 city I live in mundanely, which is how I assume a Province is run -
 someone has to have the final say, even if it is supported by some kind of
 council.  IMHO - YUCK!
     But, as I said, I haven't lived in a Province - I don't know what its
 like.  It may have advantages over being in a Barony.  But, remember, as I
 said above, someone must have final say.  This is likely to be the
 seneschal in the absence of a 'figurehead', and if the Seneschal is one of
 those Certain people who are in the running for Baron/ess (which they tend
 to be in a group converting from Shire to Barony since they are usually
 among the movers and shakers of the group), then you haven't avoided that
 particular pit.
      It would seem to me that both options must be put before the entire
 populace of your group.  The decision between Province and Barony will
 flavor your entire continuing interaction with the SCA - and its not a snap
 to change from one to the other if you decide you don't like your choice.
 Hold an election - present the choices and what they will mean to your
 populace and let them choose.  However, I don't think that that the
 personality of the possible Baron/ess should be a factor in the choice.
     Next, after the group has chosed between Province and Barony, if they
 have chosen Barony, have an election for Baron/ess.  Here in Bhakail, we
 just went through that a year ago when our former Baron migrated to the
 wilds of the North.  It is impossible to avoid hard feelings in something
 like this, but at least you have the advantage afterward of knowing that
 the entire populace has had a chance to voice their opinion in choosing.
 You should try to avoid the trials of a certain other northern group who
 took several years (as I recall) to elect their Baron/ess - establish a
 set of election rules that will force a winner with a minimum of
 re-election runs.  Also, to prevent (in some manner) your fear of
 tin-hat disease, set up your Baron/ess to a limited term - in Bhakail,
 the figurehead is only in place for two years.  Of course, if they keep
 going like they have been, we will probably not even need to hold
 elections next year, but then that was the way with our previous Baron
 as well - but it allows for the removal of a person or persons who are
 not doing their job or are abusing their position in the normal course
 of things, rather than making a massive fuss about it and calling in
 the King and stuff like that.

    Well, I hope that my comments haven't been too out of line.  I do
 realize that they are rather democratic for a Medieval Recreation Society,
 but then, I'm sure that the majority of the SCA wouldn't have it any
 other way.....

Subject: Camping Events

Somewhere in Digest 339-341, Ellisif asked about camping events and her feast
reservations.

S&M War has lately been in the 300-400 person range (375 last year), so I guess
it's probably about the same size as your event.  (War of the Roses is slightly
bigger, right, Diablu?)  We've found that for the most part, people will eat 
the Saturday night feast, even if they brought their own food for the rest of
the weekend.  For that reason, I think your guess is probably closer in line
to the actual numbers than is your cook's.  (If your cook can't handle more
than 250 -- due to lack of resources or whatever -- you folks had better talk
now.  There's nothing more traumatic for a cook than finding out that he/she
has 100 more mouths to feed than expected; this is why advance reservations
and closing dates are a good idea.  Off-board is always welcome at the door.)

We served 325 people out of the 375 who came.  The food was nothing fancy, but
there was plenty of it, and I didn't hear any complaints: cold cooked chicken 
and sauces, stew, bread and apple butter, lemonade, fruit, and cheese.  We
rented a two-burner propane monstrosity from a local rental place, and cooked
two pots of stew on it.  Everything else was either done ahead of time or cut
up and served on site.  As long as your kitchen is near water and the cooks have
plenty of tables and coolers, you should be okay.  As far as staff goes, we had
five people preparing the chicken and the sauces ahead of time, and two cooks
for the day (along with 2 or 3 kitchen gofers who showed up that day to help).
Serving was tougher; you'll have to make sure everything is easily accessible.
This year we may try two serving lines.

Good luck with your event; send me email if you want more information.

My Lady Awilda,

Becoming a Province will not solve the problem of "Who will be 'Baron Bigshot'?"
It will only change the question to "Who will be 'Viceroy Bigshot'?"  As a 
former long time resident of the Crown Province of Ostgardr (never could spell 
it) and a current resident of the Barony of Concordia of the Snows, I don't 
see any difference in the political problems between the two.  I think that what
is most important to the health of the group is not who the cerimonial Head
Honcho is (I tend to ignore them in general anyway) but that the group as a
whole can work together regardless of who 'Baron Bigshot' is.  (and if I'm 
wrong I'm sure someone will let me know at length) 

On another note:

My Lord Tim,

I like the idea of having someone doing the play-by-play (blow-by-blow?)
for a tourny.  Ithink that would generate more excitement for the
spectators and make fighting more understandable to non-fighters
(although I have been trying to explain fighting to my ladywife for 
years with no success)  I can see it now  "Good morning ladies and
gentles and welcome to The SCA's Wide World of Tournys"

oh well enough for now

Greetings all from Richard DeLacy,

        I am writing to you to beg a slight difference of opinion with Milord
Yonatan Moshe Bereb Avram Yitzhak (whew!).  Milord recently posted a few
missives opineing that the story Tim the Bizzare and Oddly-dressed Enchanter
(whew!) wrote about the reign of His Excellency Michael of Boarshaven was
inappropriate for posting to so public a forum as the rialto, saying that such
a story should be privately e-mailed to those who were interested.  And yet
Milord Yonaton has also posted long and somewhat tedious lists of resource
books to that same rialto.  Now it is just my feeling on the matter (and what
do I know?  After all I have only five syllabyls in my name :-)  but that story
was certainly of far more interest that those lists.  The story was well
written and entertaining as well as thematically important.  More importantly
it was both interesting and important to the vast majority of people on the net
(or at least the handful I asked) which those lists were not.  Thus it seems to
me, with all due respect, that it is those bibliographies that should have been
held and distributed only to the individuals who asked.

Ragnar Thorburgsson asks about things to do during an event for
non-fighters and non-archers.

When I look at fighting, I see 2 guys in armor hitting each other.
One guy hits the other's leg, he goes to his knees, the first guy hits
his own leg, HE goes to his knees, eveyone claps.  Eventually one guy
gets hit hard and falls down, and everyone claps again.  I'm sure that
I could get more out of it, but how?  Is it impossible for spectators
to get anything out of a fight?

I would like to listen to Lord Howard of Cosell. :-) Seriously, could
it be made workable?  I can go to the A&S competition and listen to an
artisan explain the art in front of us; I can go to an arms merchant
and ask about the pros and cons of various of the knives before us.
Could it be done for fighters?

I envision someone with a slightly elevated view, with 3-6 listeners
just in front of him.  He would give almost "sotto voce" comments,
ideally just loud enough for his listeners to hear, but not so loud
that others can hear (especially the fighters).  Quietness would be
critical.

There could be a few minor notes just before the fight, such as "Sir X
is famous for his polearm technique", "Lord Y has been doing well in
tourneys lately", "Z is squired to Duke W", "Here's a sword-and-shield
against a 2-handed sword.  It's important to get inside the 2-hander's
reach".  Only facts of a reasonably public nature -- nothing that
would give one fighter a major personal advantage if overheard: "Oh,
Lord A is fighting.  At the last Maidens, I used Moonwulf's Maneuver
on him and really cleaned his clocks".

There can be comments during the bout (if the fighters give
permission?).  The post-fight comments would perhaps be the most
valuable of all: "X dropped his shield for a moment, allowing the
fatal shot", "Y did well with Florentine -- he used mobility to get
his opponent".  These would be notes that would instruct me in what to
watch for in future fights, while the current one is fresh in my mind.

Could this be made workable?  Would anyone other than me be interested
in this?

Greetings!

About a week ago, someone asked why the nine of diamonds is known as
the Cruse of Scotland.  I couldn't find the original article, so I'm
posting this generally.  Sorry.

I came across the answer quite by accident yesterday in "The Highland
Clans" by Sir Iain Moncreiffe of the Ilk.  On 13 February 1692,
British government troops massacred the MacDonalds of Glencoe after
having spent the previous night billeted at their seat.  The attack
was arranged for political reasons by John Dalrymple, Master of Stair,
a minister of William of Orange.  Dalrymple's arms include a saltire
charged with nine lozenges (diamonds), hence the epithet.

Ain't heraldry wonderful!

B'Shem HaShem HaRachmon. Unto the gentles of the Rialto may this missive find
you in good health and spirits. MaAyt shel - Yonatan Moshe bereb Avram Yitzhak.

Let me make a very short clarification as to my concerns governing public
history. Hal Ravn is absolutely correct that ignorance of past problems and
their solutions is an excellent way to ensure their repetition. My concern
was that the answers to some (but not all problems) are better dealt with
privately on a need to know basis. This does not mean that individuals
should not ask, but that the answer should be through private mail. I
responded to the question by private mail twice and publicly once (as a
outside verifier for a short, accurate, recital of the facts by an unbiased
person). Frankly, the Michael B. situation had no answer or solution. The
only thing to be learned was that there are some individuals whose heads
and fantasies of power increase when they become monarchs, nothing new
ther History (past and contemporary) is filled by such unfortunates.
Identification of "problem" people (suggested in past digests) who are
likely to fight for a crown and having a friendly Duke (or other) to
take them out is only useful if they can be "identified" (whose criterion
by the way?) first. Michael was a "wild-card" that went from acceptable t
o very much less so. We coped as best we could (zero sum game). The only
benefit the discussion of this case produced was a removal of some
undeserved debris attached to one of the principal victims (yes, this is
worthy in and of itself, which is why I verified the account). In depth
discussion of Michael per se is less useful, and probably libelous.
I have lived in five Kingdoms since AS 5, and will be moving to my
sixth shortly. The most pressing issue (the one that underlies the most
real problems I have seen/experienced) is one of tolerance and empathy.
The healthy proliferation of the Society and its continuance through
the next ten years is directly tied to how well we (myself included)
manage to accomadate and accept widely differing viewpoints and modes
of expression. Authenticity police, blatant party animals, and the
problems surrounding Oaths of Fealty are all directly tied to these
issues.
Yes, lets mention the problems and get the answers, but let's also
separate the chaff from the wheat and get to the real issues. So, raise
the questions publicly if you can't get a good local answer but expect
that your best answers will probably come from private mail. If there
IS a lesson to be learned or a technique to be shared, by all means get
it into the Rialto (quick!!!!) -- but lets keep the unavoidable/untrainable
personality pishers to a minimum.

I have received several inquiries for more information, of a general sort, for

law, calligraphy, architecture, arts and crafts, medicine, philosophy,

Subject: Event Help
Message-ID:  <8905220024.aa17158@mintaka.lcs.mit.edu>


Unto Ragnar Thorburgsson and the good people of the Rialto, does
Mustapha al-Muhaddith send his best wishes for Peace and May Allah
shine kindly on his upcomming event.

Congratulations on your project and may you have good fortune with it.
However, I feel you are falling into a trap, common of first time
events, and that is that every event must contain something for
everyone.  

An event which contains and tourney and archery and a feast afterwards
already contains much, and does not need to be packed with other
activities.  The tourney, with its requisite Heralds, Marshals,
Mistresses of the Lists, Water Bearers and Chiurgeons will already use
up a substantial portion of your resources.  Adding further to that
list archery and activities for other non-fighters would greatly
strain the resources of a large Barony, not to mention an incipient
Canton.  It is better to do a little bit well, than to strain to do
everything and have it come apart at the seams.

The tourney can be of some interest to the spectators, especially if
the Herald is good.  A good herald can not only set the mideval
atmosphere at the tourney (especially by loosing obviously modern
terms like "On Deck" from his vocabulary) but can make the tourney
much more interesting by explaining to the audience what is going on.
If you have a small tourney (as it seems you are likely to do) it can
be helped along by providing challenge forms at the list table and
having most bouts be challenges.  Figure out who your herald is now
and have him/her start practicing, and find someone to spell him.

Other things that will help make the tourney more interesting to the
spectators are:  1) providing them with a shady place to watch the
tourney from and 2) having somebody (preferable a fighter) in charge
of periodicly chasing the fighters standing around in armour in front
of the spectators either to their knees or to a designate arming area
(again preferably shady) somewher out of the line of sight.  Finally,
things like backgammon sets, commet balls (a ball with a tail added),
bocce sets and other medival games may be provided.  However, unless
you have the manpower, don't feel you must entertain them, they are
perfectly capable of entertaining themselves, they can gossip, sing
songs, embroider or tell stories as suits their fancies.  

A few other pieces of advice on other proposed activities, especially
those proposed by Ellisif Flakkingskvinne:

-Merchants:  Make sure you have somebody in charge, and that that
person talks to at least one merchant beforehand to get some idea of
the kinds of problems that merchants can potentially cause and how to
avoid them.  (Some site require delicate negotiations in order to
allow merchants).
-quest and arts compentitions:  these take too much manpower and
should be left for a different event.  
-gaming tournaments:  require lots of manpower.  Far better just to
have a non-fighter who knows several medival games and is willing to
teach to anyone who is willing to learn.  Somalah  (spelling) has put
out a book of period games, anyone out there have a reference?
-classes:  Unless you are at some kind of university or schola, very
few people will probably want to attend.  This again should probably
be at a specially dedicated event.  
-dancing:  I think of this as an evening activitiy.  Fighters are out
of armour during the evening, thus bringing the ratio back towards
even.  This also requires the presence of a resonable competent dance
master and several competent dancers to get things started.  If you
don't have them in the local populace, maybe that is something you can
import from the Barony.  
-entertainment:  I think that this is again best done in the evening
(although not during dinner unless by one performer of known quality
and brevity).  A bardic circle is best run in either a quiet corner of
the hall, or better yet in another room which is more intimate and has
good accoustics.  Have an expericence performer check out your hall,
it may be accousticly dead.  Holding a bardic circle in the evening,
or holding a semi-announce but informal bardic contest during the
afternoon, may attract singers and storytellers to your tourney, and
once there they will practice their arts without any prodding from
you.  Plays and ensemble performances also work, but Ellisif's
suggestion of making sure that people who do not wish to be
entertained have somewhere to escape to is excellent and should be
well heeded.  

One more piece of well meaning advice for first time Autocrats:
DELEGATE!  DELEGATE!  DELEGATE!  Make sure you have competent (or
trainable) people in charge of all of the major activities (including
set up and clean up and gate keeping), who are responible for finding
their own crews.   If all you do as autocrat is the budget, arranging
for the site and making sure that all your deputies know who each
other are and are talking to each other on a regular basis, then your
event will run smoothly without you help, and you will be availble for
damage control when they don't.  

May Allah, the Compasionate, the Merciful smile on your upcomming
event and all your ventures.

	--Mustapha al-Muhaddith
	  (Russell Almond)

P.S.  The series of sylables "feastocrat" is not a work but rather a
ludicrous contraction of two other words.  It should be burried in a
deep hole somewhere and replace with the more palitable "kitchen
autocrat" or the perfectly good period word for chief cook: "chef."

Subject: Regalia

Recently someone from Ealdormere posted a message regarding regalia for the
new principality. I offer a few points.
(1) Study the regalia used in the real world. There is a new color video
version of the film "A Queen is Crowned", a documentary on Queen Elizabeth
II's coronation. It's very good. It's available from Publisher's Central
Bureau, among other sources.
(2) Work your totems, heraldic badges, etc. into your coronation ceremony. If
your group's badge is a wolf, place a wolf's pelt on your new prince. If it's
a deer, put antlers on the guy. Work up a legend of the founding of your
people "from the shrouded mists of time" and work your totems into it
(remember the Capotiline Wolf of Rome? -- that sort of thing).
(3) The reason for all this is to set you apart from everybody else. We're
supposed to be twelve separate countries, people, let's remember that! Okay,
so we're all confederated, but to me here in the East, An Tir and Meridies are
supposed to be *different countries* with strange inhabitants practicing odd
customs I can't understand. It doesn't have to be Ireland vs. China, it can be
England vs. Portugal -- both part of Christendom (read: the Society) but still
quite different.
(4) Two excellent examples of how to do this are Calontir and Outlands.
Calontir has their "group-persona" act together very well, I think. Good
esprit-de-corps, lots of regalia, the badges and liveries are seen everywhere,
those wonderful coordinated uniform tabards -- excellent. Outlands did an
amazing job of "being a different country" at the Pennsic War courts last year
-- completely unique "schtick".
(5) Local branches can and should do this too. Carolingia emphasizes it's role
as a center of culture by presenting a rose to the queen at coronation "in
token of her patronage of the arts". Bridge has a holy relic: the True Shield
of Camelot (ask me later), which can be displayed on solemn occasions. Be
creative!

Subject: Re: Corpora

Recently, Ricky Connell (sorry, I missed the SCA name) wrote about choosing an
SCA name, and his perceived difficulties in doing so.
My lord, denying someone the opportunity to have a made-up name is not going
to
cause anyone any difficulty. You can't have the persona of a real-life person
in the SCA. What we mean by "made-up name" is a name that was just
spontaneously created by the SCA member instead of being constructed from
period elements. For example, even though there may not have been anyone
well-known who was named Steffan ap Cennydd, the name is constructed properly
for period Welsh. On the other hand, Snorgleflarth of Gazoo is a (rather
blatant example of) a made-up name. There is such a wide world out there,
spatially and temporally, that no one should have to make up a name from
gibberish.
Choosing a persona need not be difficult. You don't have to research your
character down to the point of deciding what he had for breakfast on Dec. 14,
1302. Just find a place and time you like, pick an appropriate name out of
that culture and you've done all you ever *have* to do. Anything beyond that
is gravy. Now, having done that minimum research will probably prompt one to
do more -- that, in fact, is the true "educational" aspect of the SCA -- but
it is not required. The point is that, with a real-world base ranging from 5th
century Picts to 16th-century Japanese, why would anyone want a name out of
Fantasy (their own or someone else's!).

Subject: How to keep people busy without really trying
Message-ID:  <8905220959.aa28711@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>


Assuming that you are a small group, you're not going to wan to do anything
wlaborate to keep people busy while the fighters bash each other. You just
won't have the man power.  Asking people from other areas to teach workshops is
excellent, they get to do all the work, all you have to do if track them down,
get them to agree, set a schedule, and find a place for them to do it.  

Gaming on an informal basis is also good.  But something that might also work
is to hold a "Gaming Medeivally" class.  Someone willing to explain some of the
period variations of chess-and who makes the people in the class play one of
the variations is good.

Another one I particularly enjoy are riddles and questions.  The easiest way to
do it is to type up a list of riddles or questions and pass them out.  you
don't have to do anything.  The questions or riddles should be so obscure, nobody
can answer them by themselves.  They have to go around *asking* for help.  In
this way they are obliged to talk to other people and find out a little about
them.  If you do this right, you can make the questions appropriate to the
skills of some of the people you know will be attending.  Questions ought to be
sort of medeival trivia, questions like, "What King and Queen went around
knocking the tops off castles towers as a way of demonstrating their power to
rebellious nobles?"  And "Who kidnapped Richard the Lionhearted and what was
his ransom?"

Riddling was a very popular sport throughout the Middles Ages.  Books of
riddles can be found in the library.  There are even scholarly studies of the
history of riddling so you can pick out period riddles.  Or you can make them
up.  Oldest riddles were in verse.  A few period riddles: "What has two
backbones and  thousand ribs?"  And, "What does every lady keep below her belt
that if she lose it, she cannot get it back?"  "What has one hundred nails and
four souls?"

I have thought of other ideas, such as kite making and flying contests, but I
don't know if it's period for European personas. I haven't done it, but I would
enjoy it, so I think it's worth a try.  Mask making, and other things creative
that you do during the day is nice too.  Think of games children play,  many of
these were oringinally played by adults in the Middles Ages.  Games like
"hoodman blind" and "duck, duck goose" are period.  Note that in the adult
versions of these games, chasing after members of the opposite sex and kissing
them is a popular variations. These games allow non-fighters to run around and
work up a sweat and expend some energy.  Kids can also be incorporated.  

Improvisation is another idea.  If the event has a theme, a prize can be
awarded to whoever does the most appropriate thing based on the theme.  This
could be writing poetry, doing a scroll, a dance, a story, or  anything. 

By the way, if someone could send me an explanation of how to play "Comets" or
"Firepots", I would greatly appreciate it.

The One, True, Sacred, Official, North Woods Version of the Origin of the Cry
of Hoo-bah

Some years ago the King of the Middle was sitting on his throne in the Barony
of the Norht Woods when some dancing girls were brought into court.  They
danced in the Eastern fashion in which the faces are veiled, but the bellies
are not.  The King and his gentlemen were quite appreciative,a nd the King was
moved to cry "Hubba, hubba!"  The Queen thereupon fixed him with and icy glare
and asked, "What did you say?"  The King, realizing that his life hung inthe
balance quickly covered himslef.  "Hoo-bah, hoo-bah! I said Hoo-bah!"  And his
gentlemen came to his rescue, also crying out "Hoo-bah,"  which has been the
Midrealm's way of cheering ever since.

The One True, Slightly Confused, Official North Woods Version of the Origin of
the Cry Pooh-bah, as told by an Eyewitness

Some years later it happened again in Northwoods.  For some uneplained reason,
some unkown gentles (But one of them was Athelhawk) decided to make a gift of a
brown bear to the Barony.  Since the emblem of Northwoods is a wolf devouring
the sun, and the emblem of the Middle is a dragon, no one knew quite why they
picked a bear, but they did, and it was duly brought before the populace, who
cheered, "Hoo-bah",  whereupon some gentles cried, "NO! Pooh-bah!"  And
someone else quipped "Pooh-bear!"  Duke Sir Merowald de Sylveaston was in those
days living in the North Woods, but soon after he traveled into the land that
became the Kingdom of Trimaris, where, being a silly person, he introduced the
cheers in their new form.

Subject: Coopers info (Pennsic discussers, please read); LONG
Message-Id: <611845612/kee@A.NL.CS.CMU.EDU>

Here's some mundane-type information about the Coopers and Pennsic in
general that several people have suggested I make available on the
Rialto.  I've been living in Debateable Lands for nearly 6 years, and
these are things that I've picked up mostly by hanging around and
making myself useful now and then, as well as by doing a bit of real
research into various topics (such as mundane attitudes toward
campgrounds in this area.)  Probably some part of this information has
appeared here in other guises, but I think a lot of it hasn't.  It's
going to sound a little disconnected because it's compiled from mail
conversations that I've had with various people, but I think that it is
nonetheless readable, and it's certainly timely.  My assumptions in
posting this are that we are mostly reasonable human beings; if
anything I say here appears to imply otherwise, please try to interpret
it as reasonably as you can.  The rumors seem to be getting out of
hand, and since the Rialto has been partly responsible for their
creation and fast propagation, it seems like a good idea to post some
hard information here.

Re: the "game" of who (Coopers vs. SCA) does what to accomodate Pennsic:
 
The game has always been a series of compromises.  The Coopers have
mundane obligations of which most Pennsic-goers seem unaware (see
the next paragraph down) and inconsistent expectations on the part 
of the autocrats from one year to the next have meant that the SCA has 
not been in the best position to put forth its own interests in a
consistent way.  For years the Coopers have requested a permanent Pennsic 
Committee to deal with as an SCA interface, and this is now being tried 
on a trial basis.  (Up till now, the political will within the Midrealm 
and the East to institute such a committee was lacking.  This year's 
autocrat has instituted it; it includes representatives from at least 
4 Kingdoms, the Coopers, the autocrat's staff & the Corporation.)
If this became a permanent thing, then we could actually have continuing
legal contracts with the Coopers from year to year, with improvements 
and other obligations spelled out, because there would be a stable SCA
authority to hold up our end of the bargain.  (This is something that 
many long-term mundane campers have, in the form of a lease or a deed.)
 
The Coopers are not just in the Pennsic business.  They are also in the
business of running a family-operated mundane campground.  As an
established presence in the area, they have obligations to their
regular campers, who have in recent years become increasingly
inconvenienced by the ever-earlier Pennsic arrivals.  Western
Pennsylvania is not a land of transients.  Even in Allegheny County,
where the big city (Pgh) is, over 70% of the residents were born there. 
Much of the Coopers' business is with long-term (entire-summer and hunting
season) campers who have been going there for years.  They live in a web
of mundane obligations which can in some ways be compared to the feudal
obligation structure in the SCA.  The War takes over their lives for a
good chunk of the year, and I can certainly understand why they feel a
need to draw some kind of limits to the extent to which the War can be
allowed to disrupt the actual mundane operation of their campground.
Yes, they are well-compensated for their time and I, like many, have
tried to figure out just HOW well.  But there are some things that
money can't buy, and peace with their mundane campers is one of those
things.
 
Thus, if SCA people want to come early and camp like the rest of the 
"paying public", that is fine with the Coopers.  Like the rest of the
"paying public", when it is time to clear the site for Pennsic, they
will have to clear the site.  I don't find this particularly unfair.
When one camps there mundanely, one has to wear clothes at the swimming
hole and camp in one of the regular numbered sites.  Sometimes early
Pennsic arrivals fuss a lot over this.  Making a clear demarcation
between when Cooper's is a mundane campsite and when Cooper's is the
Pennsic site will, I hope, cut down on the inevitable friction between
what the Pennsic campers expect and what the regular campers expect.
 
In connection with our being the Cooper's major source of income, that 
does not mean that we are their only obligation (as explained above), 
or that they would prefer to concentrate solely on Pennsic.  If they
absolutely HAD to choose, I'm not at all sure they'd choose us, but I
know they would prefer NOT to have to choose--they'd rather keep us, 
and keep us happy.  It makes good business sense, and they are honest 
people, though not immune to greed.  (Disclaimer:  I don't know any of
the Coopers personally; I observe their behavior and learn what I can
about the conditions under which they operate their campground.)
 
Re: physical limitations of the Coopers' site:
 
I recommend to you Awilda's excellent comments regarding land, wells
and septic systems.  With no municipal water or sewage available, the
sanitation options are more limited than most Pennsic campers will ever
realize.  Every year the call goes out for more bathouses and flush
toilets; every other year or so another one gets built, but due to
septic requirements they must be carefully spaced out.  Each such new
facility costs about $20,000 to build, even with labor provided largely
by the Coopers and their relatives.  The porta-potties that so many
people deplore are the only way, short of a sewage treatment plant,
that the campground can accomodate 6,000 people for days on end.
(Municipalities float bond issues to build sewage treatment
plants--this is not a realistic option, at least not using current
technology.)
 
Yes, they need to get more water buffalos this year, and yes, maybe they
could try to put in a new bathroom at the rate of one a year instead of
one every two years, but those must remain as far apart from each other
as the current ones are.  The drainage field has to be carefully
managed to meet state and local sanitation laws.  Also, to be able to
build at a faster rate they will have hire outside labor, which will
drive up costs enormously, and they can hardly be reasonably expected
to sink a huge amount of money into the speed factor to accomodate us
for two weeks out of the year--unless we help (presumably by putting
money into the building fund.)
 
[Cariadoc, if I have made any economically-unsound assumptions I am
counting on you to set me straight, y'hear? ;-]
 
I also think that there needs to be a larger covered space than that
afforded by the Barn, and this means either enlarging the Barn,
building a bigger one close by, or renting an enormous tent as was
done at the TYC.  I suspect the last option is the cheapest one in the
short term.  Then the fight over where THAT would be pitched would
probably end up being a battle royal, and nobody would be pleased with
it until it had been there long enough to be a "tradition" (about 2
Pennsics, by my reckoning. ;-)  Let me not borrow trouble by belaboring
this point at any more length.
 
Re: the building fund and the $5 fee:
 
Obviously a delicate topic, this was one of the features of the
compromise arrived at by the Pennsic Committee at its meeting 3 weeks
ago.  The Coopers did NOT request the $5 fee, or ask that it go into
the building fund.  The creation of the fee was the compromise arrived
at to discourage campers from grabbing more land than was justified by
the number of people in a group, and also to discourage land speculation
on a grand scale; both of these practices, while they can be considered
features of a free market, are generally agreed to be unfair (in this
context) by those who do not practice them, which constitutes a large 
majority of Pennsic campers.
 
The fee was argued for and against; putting it into the building fund
was argued for and against; the Committee, not the Coopers, made these
decisions and they made them because they saw a need to protect against
abuses.  These abuses in fact exist and are not hypothetical.  If you
would like to make reasoned arguments against the fee, please feel free
to do so, and feel free to send reasonable letters on this score to the
Pennsic Autocrat, whose address will appear (if it hasn't already) in
your Kingdom newsletter, or certainly can be had by asking on the
Rialto.  (I don't have my "Pikestaff" here at work, or I'd post it.)
 
The building fund does have uses which appear pretty legitimate to me,
some of which are mentioned in the last section of this post, and
others which can be inferred from what we all know to be the needs of
the Pennsic War.  This doesn't mean that the site fee is justified;
obviously there is more than one side to that question!
 
Re: space to camp, crowding of facilities: facts & suggestions
 
Camping space:  There has been more land available just about every
year for the past 5 or so.  The Coopers have leased their neighbor's
cornfield for parking and battle space, so as to move camping into the
space formerly used for those things.  This year, the Woods Battle has
been almost totally moved onto newly-purchased land farther up the
causeway, and partly into a chunk of Moraine State Park which borders
on the old battle area.  Much of the former Woods Battle area will be 
available for camping this year.  There will be a second swimming hole
downstream for people who prefer clothes, and there will be camping
allowed all through that area, as I understand it.  It looks to me
like, the more people who camp in the woods (and get all that lovely
shade), the less the need for ANYONE to have to camp next to the
parking lot, and get all that awful dust and noise!
 
[In this connection, I can't resist mentioning that the BMDL's own
Random Wronghand was the first to take seriously the notion that the
SCA might be able to fight in part of Moraine State Park's land, and he
was the first to contact the park rangers about this, which was about a
year ago.  His initial contacts met with great success, though a later
administrative mixup meant that we had to cancel a BMDL fighting practice
scheduled there last summer.  Since then negotiations have been taken
over by Pennsic staff, not by the BMDL, and evidently they also have
been successful.  I hope that all goes well for this new twist to an
old game!]
 
I agree that scouting out some kind of backup or alternate site would
be a good idea.  More to the point, in alleviating the current problems
of the current site, I think that Cher of Bellvue has an excellent
idea in encouraging people to consider camping or motels close by and
making a short commute to Pennsic.  That would take some of the load
off the site, especially in terms of camping space and showers, which
are two of the sorest points there are.  This certainly wouldn't do
for everyone, but I'm sure there are those out there who would find
that they actually prefer it (I know some of them who already do!)
 
Re: The SCA (or some private group of SCA friends) buying its own site:
 
Awilda's comments about the problems of the SCA developing its own site
are certainly on target.  Yet, I think that perhaps Eastern Ohio would
be a good place to look for land, despite the inherent difficulties of
the SCA's doing Pennsic on its own.  Land is cheaper there, and of much
the same character as it is in the area of Cooper's Lake.  It's in the
same general central region between the Middle and the East.  Ohio's
mundane laws are generally less restrictive than Pennsylvania's.  It would
take YEARS to bring this off, but if the SCA continues to grow at the
current rate I think it will eventually become feasible--with some good
legal and business minds at the helm.
 
That doesn't mean that Pennsylvania, Western New York or the extreme
northern part of West Virginia wouldn't also be good places to look for
land.  I didn't say that and I don't mean to imply it.  Since at the 
current time any holding forth on this topic is of necessity highly
hypothetical, I won't waste anyone's time doing more of it.
 
-------
 
This ends my comments.  If anyone would like to send me mail about
this, I can't promise to answer it, though come NEXT WEEK I would
probably try to.  Basically the best of what I have to say is outlined
above, and I don't consider myself obliged to defend against every fuss
and flame.  However, I do want to encourage people to bring a positive
attitude to this discussion, because once the ball gets rolling it's
the positive viewpoints that make real progress happen.  It sure looks
to me like the ball is rotating at relativistic speeds already. ;-)
 
I thank everyone who has read this far for their patience!
 
This has come to you more from my mundane persona than my SCA one, and
thus I will sign myself mundanely,

Subject: Unarmoured Training

Good Day Gentles
  I am sligtly disturbed  at what I see  as an "Acceptable" method of training
while unarmoured!   Should anyone get  the opportunity to see  His Grace, Duke
Syr  Laurelen  Darksbane, or  His  Excellency,  Earl ( Iarl ? )  Syr  Emrys of 
Gwyntarian (perhaps at Pennsic), ask them to recount the tale of Emrys's early 
training  in single sword  and the resulting  trip to the *HOSPITAL*.   It was 
in about A.S. 18.   The details basically were that a very small piece of duct
tape that was sticking  off of the  end of his blade  swept across  Laurelen's
eyelid causing a "paper cut" that required micro-surgery and the use of an eye 
patch for about a month.  They were working **VERY** slowly at the time but it
doesn't take much!   This occurred between two seasoned veterans,  not rookies
and was just a freak occurrence.  But, then again, how difficult would it have
been for the helmets to be put on to avoid the whole situation?   The moral of
my tale is a simple one... *** DON'T SWING ANYTHING AT  ANYONE NOT WEARING THE
PROPER  PROTECTIVE GEAR !!! ***    If you want to  practice unarmoured,  fine, 
practice unarmed as well; NO PROBLEM.

  P.S.  That was  probably the fastest  turnaround time  I have ever witnessed
from a hospital emergency room! 
      Accident Occurs ... 
      Go to Hospital ... 
      Get Treated ... 
      Make Arrangements for Surgery ... 
      Return to Fight Practice Site   
      Elapsed Time = 45 Minutes!
  After all, how often do two stapping  young fellows dressed from head to toe
in twelfth century  Knight's garb wander  into the average  hospital emergency 
room responding to the the nurses questions...
      Nurse:    "What Happened?"    
      Laurelen: "I got hit with a sword."
      Nurse:    "a WHAT? "
      Laurelen & Emrys: "a sword."
      Nurse:    "Who hit you?"
      Emrys:    "I did"
      Nurse:    "O.K. the Doctor will be RIGHT WITH YOU!!!!!"
  Yet another tale  that is much funnier  many years later than it was on that

Subject: Pennsic Land Appropriation

  Greetings good gentles!
  As time for Pennsic approaches snd many missives have been passing by on the
subject of appropriating land it  has occurred to me that a slightly different
viewpoint might be in order here.
  I ask if, perhaps, The War HAS outgrown the SCA?   I say this because I have
seen most of the lands that  Their Excellencies,  Baron & Baronnes Cooper hold
sway over and they are  *TRULY VAST*.   To give you an idea,  the area that we
use ( From the top of the  "Hill North of the Main Battle Field" to the "Woods
Road  Along  the  Lake" )  is only  about 25%  of  their  lands.   There  is a 
*considerable*  amount of  unused space  north of  the "Hill North of the Main 
Battle Field". If you ever find anyone who has been on "The Hayride from HELL"
(Look in the  BM Debatable Lands,  or the Barony of the Cleftlands),  they can 
possibly tell you what it's like.   So in answer to the question of  "Has  The
War outgrown  Cooper's Lake Campground?"...  the answer is a resounding  "NO".
  So, what is the problem?  Think about how enjoyable it would be to hike back
to camp from the Woods Battle to, say,  another half a  mile beyond the  "Hill 
North of the Main Battle Field".   I'd be willing  to bet this wouldn't excite
many people.   I know  I had a hard time getting back to my camp at the corner
of  Howard's Fenway  and the  Great Eastern Highway  after the Woods Battle of
P. W. 11 where the temperatures soared to over 100 degrees Farenheit!  That is 
just the  beginning  of the  trip  I described  above!!!   The  "hay wagon bus 
service" has been a great  help in moving things about since those days but it
can't be relied upon to be everyone's personal pack-horse.  These are problems
that would be present no matter where the war was held.
  We've come  a long way from  the forced march from  Scotland to  Hastings to 
join each  other in battle  but it won't  be much different  as more and  more 
people join us at The War.  
  As far   as determining  who gets  what land,  I am  in  agreement  with the 
original postings staements...

Subject: Persona
Message-ID:  <8905221856.aa25435@mintaka.lcs.mit.edu>

Kale says hi.

I think people are meaning different things when they use phrases like
"doing persona" or "being in persona", and sometimes this can lead to
e-arguments that are confusing as well as confused.

At one end of the spectrum, "in persona" means anything to do with
the SCA-as-medieval-society (as opposed to SCA-as-*medievalist*-
society).  When we're in medieval garb, using our medieval names,
in the group that's ruled by kings not administered by branch
officers--the things we're doing are done "in persona".  When some
people on the Rialto talk about banishment as being a punishment
"in persona", they mean a punishment inflicted *within* the medieval
game, not something done to the mundane person (which expulsion from
the club would be).  Hilary of Serendip may not "do persona" in any
of the further senses of this article, put I assume she respects the
Crown as more than a funny hat, and I myself have seen her wear garb.

Further along, "having a persona" means picking a time and place within
the SCA's boundaries (or "just visiting"), and taking your name, your
garb, your accessories from that culture.  Some people don't do this at
all, others are kind of fuzzy about it ("from the North", instead of
"Brittany, 1485"), and most of us bend things a bit: we all know Vikings
who own at least one Cavalier outfit, or Tudors who dress barbarian for
the war.  This is the degree to which I myself "do persona".

Next (though of course these are not separate pigeonholes, put general-
izations along a spectrum) is persona as described in Cariadoc's Miscel-
lany: immersion (only as intensive as the individual cares for) into
the life that a medieval person of your chosen locale, time, class,
age group, etc., would have *lived*, the little things like: do you use
money? what kind? how do you tell time? what is your lord's title? and his
lord's? who makes your clothes? how much washing is healthy for you?  I
consider this level, persona as a field of study, to be the sort of thing
that sets the SCA above a costume party; I regard it as an ideal level,
though I admit I fall short.

At the far extreme are those who compile a 14-volume autobiography of
their persona, heavily footnoted with one volume of bibliography.  This
is, of course, ridiculous. :-) But there are those...

There's lots of room here for different amounts of interest.  But I think
you have to fall *somewhere* on this spectrum to claim you're playing our
game at all, and I've let you know whereabouts I fall.  Anyone care to
refute? flame? expand?

Appendix:  Around the middle ranges of the spectrum I set up, there creeps
in the idea of "talking forsoothly" as part of "being in persona".  You
know, saying "farspeaker rune" to sound more medieval than "telephone
number", or "dragon" for its atmosphere even though "wagon" (or even "car"!)
would be perfectly good period English.  I suppose conciously modifying
your speech shows you're putting some effort into the act, but I think it's
counter-productive: I'd rather say "wagon", and pretend there are horses,
than say "dragon", and treat my friends as if they got here in the belly
of a fire-breathing reptile.  This, I'm prepared to get flak on.

Subject: Names
Message-ID:  <8905221913.aa25039@mintaka.lcs.mit.edu>

Kale says hi.

If a name is documentably period, and it sounds period, fine, no problem.
Similarly, if it *sounds* out of period, and it *is* out of period, only
the bearer and her/his close friends will object to the flushing sound.
But in between are problem areas.

Names that are period, can be documented, but *sound* wrong.  This includes
the "Bubba Goodgodson" (or whatever it was) cited recently on the Rialto,
or good ol' Tonkatoy (are you still out there?): I believe these can be
banned as bad theatre, if not outright rules hacking.  But what about names
that are forbidden by our rules for reasons other than outrageously mundane
sound, but are perfectly valid given period naming practices?  For example,
Thor Odinsson is illegal, unless you can throw thunderbolts etc.; but what
about Thor with some other surname - there are sufficient period examples,
but I have been given to understand you just can't take the name of a
divine being.  But see my own case, below.

Then what about names that are undocumented, but have "period ambiance"?
(the issue on the table, er, Rialto)  The problem here is, who decides
what sounds good?  Suppose someone decides they want a name that "sounds
Norse", but not finding one she likes in the literature, she decides that
Njala is "obviously" the feminine form of Njal.  Well, it isn't; it's the
dative (I think - I started this example without my Gordon's - silly of me
- well, the argument is still valid so I'll press on), and the diminutive,
and (hence) the nickname for the saga, but it's not a woman's name.  But
I'm just an expert (maybe) on the language - if Njala's whole barony thinks
it sounds fine on her and contributes to the period ambiance, am I just
an old fart picking nits? (mixed metaphor there, sorry)  Who decides?  And
under the circumstances, is it inherently evil to ask for documentation?
But again, see my case, below.

This also brings up the question of using 20th century fantasy literature
to document medieval-sounding names.  I have some philosophical problems
with the practice, and a few very specific disagreements.  But maybe I'll
save them for another time - this is getting too long already.

So, a case study: how I got my name.  (with thanks to Kwellend-Njal and
Cariadoc for giving me a context)  I decided on an early-period Scandinavian
persona; then I figured that I wanted a name that echoed my mundane name (at
least visually).  I found the name "Kali" in Orkneyinga Saga (twice, actually)
and chose that.  But halfway round the world from the Orkneys, Kali is a
Vedic death goddess (with lots of other connotations, some benign, I know);
she even appears as a major character in Roger Zelazny's _Lord of Light_
(excellent book).  I just *knew* that no one would have ever heard of
Jarl Rognvald Kali, but *everyone* would assume that I was naming myself
after what's-her-name.  So I chickened out, and adopted a variant spelling,
modelled on the Swedish nickname Kalle (nickname for Karl) but totally
unjustified linguistically.  The name was eventually approved by Laurel
(I had long problems with a device, and back then they were approved or 
not as an inseparable team), but with a request for documentation.  I
never gave any.  

So, was I overly cautious?  Arval: if I were to submit the name 
Kali to the College, complete with documentation from Orkneyinga 
(two different individuals, mind - it's not unique), proof of 
masculine gender, and making no claims to immortality, would pass?  
Anyone else: if you saw the name Kali would you just assume the 
bearer is taking a Vedic goddess' name, and if so how hard a time 
would you have given me?  (Not that I'm going to change it now -
it's on too many scrolls - but so's I know what the rules *are* 
before I claim to have broken them.  I can live with the fact
that our friends in Nordmark think of Donald Duck every
time they see my name.)

'Nuff said.  Hoping for feedback.

Subject: There We Were

First, to clarify: yes, David, this is the book you saw. By the second section,
Cooper's Lake (and, indeed, much of Butler County) has been purchased by the
SCA and made into "Pennsicland", a Disney-style theme park except for August,
when the mundanes get chased out so we can have the War. In general, it is
a direct mathematical extrapolation of where we're going. It is both funny
and a little scary, because so far, it's been quite accurate. There are three
parts to the story. The first is an issue of the Predawn Leftist (Yosef's
homebrew newspaper), describing the 34th Pennsic War (about six pages); the
second is a book called "There We Were", which describes the 45th War (about
30 pages); the last volume is "There We Were -- the Conclusion" (or something
like that), and is an SF story about the 260-somethingth War (also about 30
pages).

I have spoken with Yosef about it, and he doesn't mind if someone types it
in for the Rialto community. However, I'd like to suggest some ground rules
(assuming someone decides to undertake this project). First, don't send it
off as a lump to the Rialto. Either a) make it available through mail and/or
FTP or b) send it *gradually* to the Rialto (one chapter a week probably
wouldn't increase our volume very much). Second, please please *please*
remember to give credit (or blame) where it is due, and include an 
acknowledgement in each piece...

Finally, about the speculation that a Kingdom of the Lakes would interfere
with Pennsic -- not according to Yosef. By the 45th Pennsic, the East and
the Midrealm are fighting on the same side anyway...

Message-ID:  <8905221750.aa12834@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>


Early this year Dame Enid posed tot he Rialto a question she had a about how to
handle a certain problem in  her group.  I am afraid I am about to encounter a
similiar problem and would appreciate other people's advice.

Our shire has been large and successfull.  A Certain Lord  has suggested that
we ought to ask for an upgrade in status to barony.  Most people think an
upgrade is a good idea.  here's the sticker:  There is no general concensus
about who should be baron/ess.  The Certain Lord has given many years of
service and feels he should be baron.  A Certain Lady has given many years of
service and has her adherents.  Others find that these two canidates have flaws
they can accept in an officer, by not in a permanent ceremonial figurehead, and
support Somebody Else, but Somebody Else is not technically a member of the
group, even though he has given long hard service.  (His mailing address is
elsewhere).  Some others want a barony but have No Preference for baron.  Some
want a province, and thereby avoid the whole sticky mess of who's going to get
to be Baron Bigshot. 

It has been suggested that Certain Lord and Certain Lady should be Baron and
Baroness together, though they each have significant others.  I have serious
misgivings about both canidates.  In particular, I think Certain Lord has a
severe case of "I want to be a Baron.  I deserve to be a Baron, therefore we're
going to be going to be a Barony."  Certain Lady I don't know as well, but I
have the feeling that she likes Being Important.  In other words, I'm afraid
that the two front runners for ceremonial figurehead would get bad cases of
"brass hat disease". I've been around too many cases of the disease to want to
want to be around it again.  In case you can't guess, I favor becoming a
province.

Some questions about province status have been raised.  It is my understanding
that a province is exactly like a barony except it has no figurehead.  I
understand that it is customary for provinces not to hand out local awards, but
that this is not a legally distinction.  Certain Lord assures me that while it
may be legally possible for provinces to hand out awards, It Just Isn't Done. Certain
Lord also insists that being a barony is far more prestigious than being a province.  
What do other people feel about provinces?  Are there some unwritten rules
about provinces of which I am unaware? What do people living in provinces think
of them?

I am concerned about my shire and what happens to it.  I am sure a point will
come in which people of the shire shall communicate to the Crown about this
matter.  Shall I write to explain why I do not want Certain Lord and Certain
Lady as my baron/ess?  Or should I just shut up about the matter, not rock the
boat, and stay on good terms with everybody?  My gut tells me that I should
speak my mind, my conscience tells me that I have no right to promote
factionalism within the group. 

I would appreciate any input on this matter so that I can  deal with it before
the battle lines are drawn, and hopefully, prevent battles from occuring at
all.

Subject: re: activities for nonfighters/feast at camping events
From: Orilee_J_Ireland-Delfs.wbst845@xerox.com
Message-ID: <890522-190309-6332@Xerox>

To Ragnar Thorburgsson,

I attended a Twelfth Night celebration in Septemtria one year that had a
number of activities for everyone, including the fighters.  Most
particularly, I remember a tug-of-war tournament.  This worked well for the
fighter-types since it was very physical and required muscle and they had a
great time showing off.  (The winning team probably weighed as much as the
rest of the hall combined -- they were quite impressive).

A quest or, rather, a scavenger hunt that we used at Sergeant's and
Yeoman's this year for the children consisted of a collection of cards
(business card sized) with things written on them, like A Seneschal, A
Knight, a member of Barony X, etc.  The children wrote their names on the
back of the cards, then had to find a person matching the description.  At
the end of the day, the cards were collected and the person with the most
correctly identified won.

For Lady Ellisif,

A Stumper!  Most camping events that I attend serve a feast in the evenings
(Myrkfaelinn, Thescorre's Pax, War of Roses in Concordia).  I have had good
experiences and bad experiences. 

(I don't eat the feast at War of Roses because after three years of paying
for a feast that was always served late and with raw meat, I gave up.
However, both Thescorre and Myrkfaelinn serve wonderful outdoor feasts.  I
do also remember a camping event in Canada that served a horrendous feast
and, when asked how we liked it and we told them our opinion, was told "
well, what do you expect for an outdoor feast?".   We went back to our camp
and made grilled cheese sandwiches for anyone who wanted them.)

Two observations on feasts at camping events:
1)  It means you don't have to plan a meal and provide all the fixings; you
get to sit and socialize with others in a central spot; there is
opportunity for entertainment; it's a challenge for the cooks to cook with
what is available (Pax uses wood and charcoal firepits and coleman stoves
in combination, plus a lot of pre-event cooking, and they've served three
meals on site).

2) It means you don't get to practice cooking dinner at a camping event
until Pennsic; you can't guarantee quality of the food (although if a group
does a good indoor feast, they will usually do a good outdoor feast); it
means one more added burden to the autocrat.

A suggestion might be to discuss it with your cooks and see what happens
(this also depends upon facilities -- Myrkfaelinn has a kitchen they use,
Pax doesn't).  You could do a limited feast for Royalty and guests, you
could set a limit if your cooks feel 250 for an outdoor feast is
unreasonable, you could leave it at bring your own.  Given the event (and I
think I know what event you are planning for), there probably will be
little difference in attendance based on your decision.  At Pax usually
about 2/3 of the people attending eat on-board.  You might want to consider
planning to cook for certain people who *must* attend the event from a
great distance and who would appreciate being *catered to* for a weekend
(Royalty, Kingdom Officers, etc.).

Good luck with your plans!

Okay, you did it. somebody out there asked for the words to Chainmail Mama.  I
have both words and music as they appeared in The Compleat Rivenstar Songbook,
Edited by Moonwulf Starkadhersson.  Music and words are by that same gentle.
If you want a copy, send me your snail mail address and I'll violate Moonwulf's
copyrights and send you one.

The major result of me looking for Chainmail Mama was to make me drag out all
the music I haven't looked at in ages, and now I can't stop.  I have words-and
music-to a number of pieces that have been popular in the SCA.  And now, if
anybody's looking in particular for anything, (Gulp) let me know, and if I've
got it, you can have it.  (Ah, I have successfully resisted the urge to print
on the Rialto every song that amuses me. You'll have to ask to get them.)

   Milords and Ladies, Ian Aelf.....No Never mind, I can't do this in Persona.
 
 I disagree MOST strongly to Lady Niccolla's comments. I will admit that I
found them VERY funny to read, and then I thought upon this. (After O finished
getting the scorch-marks off the opposing wall). 
 I belive more strongly in bringing new people to a war/Camping event than I
would for bringing someone to a large Con, such as WesterCon or WorldCon. In
bringing someone new to a Con, they are faced with too much to deal with, and
will miss many things. At a SCA outing event, is where the magik of the
Society lays.
 My best memory of the Society lays with The Estrella and Grand Outlands
events. In Estrella, it was wonderful wandering around in something that,
aside from the usage of tents, FELT like a medieval town. Sure you can get
bored. Who Can't?? But at a truly large event you'll only get bored if you
don't wander. I have at Outlandish, gotten bored, then gotten grabben into a
War Drum Session(Which Igreatly enjoyed), Then into a discussion on Falconry with
a fellow who had the most beautiful Falcon, Who was in turn suprised when the
bird allowed me to pet her.(She never lets ANYBODY touch her!?!).
 You get out what you put in.
 As to the young lady in question's, Ahem, Well, ENDOWMENTS. I don't belive
that I would be complaining, as neither have I heard ladies complain about the
shortness of my skirts. There is a marked difference between wanting to show
up and party, and wanting to join in enjoy, (And yes! Party!) and just not
know how to do so correctly. Those who are of the Dream, will stay, the
others, will go.
 I could not state all of this as Ian Aelfstan, I think he would have been far
less polite about it. I apologise.
                                        I leave you,

Subject: Entertainment during an event
Message-Id: <3294@tank.uchicago.edu>

Ragnar Thorburgsson asks about things to do during an event for
non-fighters and non-archers. Some possibilities are: 

Period games, both board games and running-around games. Master Salomallah
wrote a book on the subject; I believe it is still available from
Raymond's Quiet Press. Some are variants of games still played (chess, for
instance), others are interesting games that have essentially disappeared
(Hneftafl/Tawlbrydd/Fitchnell/Tablut, and the Morris games). One way of
doing the board games is to have someone wandering around with a board and
some pieces, asking people if they would like to try playing. Once someone
gets interested and plays a game, you get someone else playing him. Then
you leave them the board and pieces (I use printed cardboard boards), get
another, and start wandering around with ... . This is less organized than
a tournament and, to me at least, feels more medieval--the games are an
entertainment for noblefolk, not a mass contest.

Another possibility is story telling/poetry/singing. My own, possibly
biased, opinion is that story telling is the best of the three for
entertaining a substantial number of people for a substantial length of
time. One possibility is to turn it into a bardic circle--the problem is
keeping out people who do not know how to tell stories, but insist on
telling long (and often out of period) ones because they like the
attention. The other is to simply have a wandering story teller. At our
recent event, I arranged to have Mistress Morgana around and in charge of
a permanent bardic circle, which worked nicely. If you are not too far
from Septentria (I do not know Canadian geography very well, I am afraid)
you might try to borrow Aedan and  Caffa's harper (Rhiannon--a nice lady
and a good, low key, entertainer).

I have at least mildly negative feelings about most quests, since they
generally feel more like 20th century people talking about the Middle Ages
than things being done by medieval people, but of course that may depend
on how they are organized and presented. Similarly for boffer tournaments.
You might start by asking yourself how medieval people solved your
problem--how they entertained their guests--and see if the solution works
for you.

Subject:      Smoked foods - The Recipes
Message-ID:  <8905181311.aa21432@mintaka.lcs.mit.edu>

Gang, Due to popular demand, I am posting the recipes which Mistress
Niccola translated... Orlando
---
Here are three recipes I have translated from the "Cookbook of Sabina
Welserin", dated 1553. I hope they are of some use to you. I would be
interested in knowing how they work out, if you try them. I do not
guarantee the perfect accuracy of the translation, every word, but I'm
pretty sure it's mostly right. Best wishes on your experiments.

58. To make dried pork. Take a quarter of a sow and salt it very well, so
that it is entirely white with salt. Put it in a cellar. Let the salt
dissolve from it [into a dish] and when it has dissolved, take up the
liquid and pour it again over the meat. Do that each day two or three
times, and when it has lain four weeks in the salt, then hang it up and
smoke it well until it becomes well dried and very hard. Let it hang
eight days in the smoke. Afterward, hang it in a room where the air can
get in. It will keep well the whole year.

59.If you wish to make good dried beef. In this way you may make smoked
meat: Take pieces of meat as thick as three fingers of a man, and salt it
well, so that it becomes white with salt. And when the salt has dissolved
then take up the liquid and pour it over the meat again. Or turn the
bottommost part to the top, so the salt runs all over. And when it has
lain four days in the salt, then hang it up and smoke it with juniper
branches. Let it hang three days. It will be a fine red.

202. To make dried tongue, the recipe from Herr Jorg Fugger. Take the
fresh tongue. Cut the gullet well away. Then one should strike or rap it
along its length over a block or stool, not too hard, so you do not crush
it or make it ragged. But one must beat it until the core behind becomes
soft and the tip as well. It should not become so soft at the tip,
though, as further back at the thick part. Then, when it has been beaten,
one must turn it over in salt in a trough a good while. Then one should
salt it like any other meat. And cut a good red beet, raw, into dice and
scatter it with herbs above and below the meat, but not too much. And let
it stand thus a day, or overnight in a warm room. Then lay a small plank
on it and a good heavy stone and let it stand thus four weeks. If in four
or five days, no juice covers it, one must chop up a beet and simmer it
in water. Then strain out the beet and pour a glass of vinegar into the
water. The water should be cool enough that one can dip a finger into it.
(One may also simmer a few herbs with the beets if the broth would
otherwise be too red.) And pour it in with the raw beets and herbs and
salt until the meat is covered. One may let it lay five weeks or longer,
and when one hangs it, one should stick a hole through the thicker end
with a needle and hang it on a coarse thread in a kitchen with no chimney
hood, and not over the fire in the thick smoke. The outside will be a
fine brown, an excellent brown.

If anyone's interested, it's called 'The Tower' and has various diver's announc

This does not include people who moved out of Kingdom prior
to 1984, or people who were in Caid or An Tir and have not moved
back into the West.  It also does not include 27 peerages from
out of Kingdom, (including my own Pelican.)

As for active, define active.  If once a year at events is it,
then about half.  20 to 30 Knights show to a Crown, with 15-20
competing.

                          Waldt von Markheim, Golem Pursuivant, West

In conversation he mentioned that the anomaly in the years I and II is
a result of the mass Knighting that took place at the second XIIth
night.

As for the "active" issue--just looking around I think there are
around 20 to 30 active Pelicans, the same for Laurels, and about
40 to 50 active Chivalry.  This guess is based on the size of the
crowd at the Peerage meetings.

What is also not apparrent from the list is that this does not
represent 360 *individuals*.  We have a number of multiple Peers--
Master Sir Waldt, Mistress Sir Hilary, Master Master Sir William
the Lucky, Duke Master Master Frederick of Holland to name just a few.

Unto the good folk of the Rialto my greetings,

Bryniau Twynnog is a brand new canton up here in Ontario.  We are looking to 
hold an event in early to mid november.  An experienced feastocrat, a fighting
marshal, and an archery marshal have been obtained.  Merchants will be welcome.

To my intense worry I note that this seems to exclude a large group of people
from doing things during the day, the non-fighters.  To this end I ask of you
what entertainments are common/uncommon/can be provided for them.  I have heard
of quests, and boffer tourneys which sound like fun.  Is there anything else
out there?

This will be our first event and we are quite concerned with leaving a good 
impression.

For any and all help that arrives, my profuse thanks.

In service to the dream,                   ::    Blue Skies,

semesters out of town and beyond walking distance to the Rialto, I returned
to find some 200 to 250 messages backlogged on alt.sca.  The following is
my mass reply to what I've read.  With any luck, it won't be nearly as
long as anything Mistress Cher has posted (snicker).  The topics vary.
Thanks in advance for your patience.


The easy stuff first:

Ariel:  The Trimarian Crown Lyst has not yet been held.  It will take place
Memorial Day weekend.  I'm very fond of Arlof and am glad he's fighting -
he'd make a great king.  I'll post the results when I return.  That is, if
Cher doesn't beat me to it.

Pennsic water or lack thereof:  This past Pennsic, I was camped up on
Tuchux Hill.  I recall washing my hair under one of the faucets only to have
the water stop running (didn't have to use conditioner again for weeks!).
Seems if someone in the campsite(s) below us used the faucets, the
pressure dropped so much that nothing made it up the hill.  I guess.

Cooperate with your attacker(s):  I suppose this doesn't belong here, but
I recall hearing that "statistics showed" (if that really means anything
at all) that it didn't matter if a woman struggled with the rapist.  She
was just as apt to get more abuse if she fought as if she didn't.

Now for something a little more meatier:

Trimarian Art/Sci competitions are now judged differently than the 100 point
form.  The same ideas apply - Is the entry well documented, are the 
techniques appropriate to the time period, etc.  However, the point part
is eliminated.  There are 5 levels of "achievement" (for lack of a better
word): Honorable Mention, Merit, Superior Merit, Exceptional Merit, and
Non Pareil.  Non Pareil pretty much means the piece is not only perfect
to look at, but was made perfectly from the beginning.  The materials
used were period, as well as the techniques from start to finish.  It was
hand sewn or the silver was smelted out of ore and alloyed and drawn by
hand and ... I suppose you get the idea.  We've only done this once
so my memory may be a bit fuzzy, I believe there was also a best of
category as well as a best of show.  For the overall winning, each
achievement was given points and those are added up to find who did
best.  The limit to numbers of entries still apply, although what that
limit is has been varying from faire to faire as we experiment on how
to run the competition more smoothly.

I know of a gentle whose woodcraft is wonderful.  However, he doesn't
think much of competitions.  Instead of entering his work into Art/Scis,
he usually brings whatever his latest project is and displays it.  There
is usually a piece of paper tacked to it describing the piece and how it
was made, etc.  It's something I've thought of doing myself when I cannot
come up with sufficient documentation for whatever I've been doing. 
It is a viable alternative.  Your work gets seen without the hassle and
headache competitions can be.

Associate-ship:  I learned much of what I know about lace from a woman
who later moved from the Kingdom.  If she had remained, I have little
doubt that I would have become her apprentice (she was granted her
Laurel shortly before she left).  After her departure, it was generally
noted that I was her "legacy" of a sort.  I have remained on the Lauralate's
"To Watch" list for quite sometime.  School, among other things, has 
pretty much stood between me and so many of the things I would like to 
accomplish in the Society.  I had pretty much taken it for granted that
once I started teaching regularly, producing quality lace consistently,
and generaly behaving in a Laurel-like manner, I would be recognized as
a Laurel.  My point is not one of the merit badge syndrome but that
not being an apprentice to any Laurel would in no way affect my chances
of receiving said Laurel.  I am most definitely NOT on a peerage quest.

I once believed that a Laurel should not apprentice someone who did not
share the same craft.  However, times change as well as opinions.
I have since become apprenticed to a Laurel who does not share my craft of
lace.  She is a costumer and a weaver, both crafts that I wish to learn.
Indeed, my garb has drastically improved with her help!  Even more
important, I have someone to look at my work who *will* tell me, "Hey.  I
know you can do better.  Start over."  Most folk look at my work with
awe - even when I'm not impressed with it.  This is something I have needed.
My forte, however, remains to be lace, in all its forms.
In Trimaris, it takes more than mastery in just one craft to garner a
Laurel (along with the requisites of chivalry and service, of cource).  I'll
not receive a Laurel because my cavalier collars and cuffs are the finest in
the kingdom (trust me - they aren't).  Diversity is as important as well.
I have a lot of respect for my Laurel as well as affection.  I'm honored
to be a part of her household.  She has become a trusted friend as well.

Being an associate isn't for everyone.  Everyone has a different reason
for being one or not being one.  Hopefully, it won't affect one's being
recognized as a Peer.  In my most humble opinion, it shouldn't.

...hmm, it's lunch-time, gentles-all.  `Till next time, I remain

in service to the Society

Well put--but I wish to disagree to some extent.  We are part of a rapidly
growing organization.  There is a need--from time to time--to be sure that
the mistakes of the past are known, so that they may not be repeated in
the future.  

I am sorry that this incident distresses you.  You have my condolences.
However, I think you would be far more upset if you thought that some
one might have to go through the same turmoil again--due to ignorance of
what happened.  I note that there has been no *discussion* about what
happened.  This is reasonable--none is needed.  The facts speak for
themselves.

Don't be too sure the profits are "exorbitant".  I've seen enough businesses
from the inside to know that what looks high to outsider may not be so much
from the inside.  If you think the rates are that bad--start talking to other
operators and see what kind of rates are negotiable--you can always use that
data for lverage.  Of course you may not find it useful that way.

I am given to understand that rain is normal during Pennsic? (Excuse my 
ignorance of the details of local weather patterns--we have dry weather
for six to eight months of the year.)  I've seen what a few hundred
SCA members can do to a wet field in a day.  It may take the Coopers most
of the year to get some of the fields back in shape for the *next* war.
If so, the Kingdoms would do better to negotiate *higher* rates and 
make the reservation full-time!

Rather the contrary comment--the West has *3* reigns a year.  Crown
Tourneys are in March, June and October.  Coronations at XIIth Night,
Mayday and in August.  There *are* advantages . . . 

I'd like to know what possessed the other Kingdoms to use 2 reigns
per year?  (I can understand Atenvledt doing so--they don't call it
the Principality of the Sun for nothing!)

Here's as definitve a word as you're going to get (My thanks to Sir Waldt
von Markheim):

Current version of the 'Ring Oath', as copied from Vesper Principal
Herald's Ceremony book (Knighting ceremony) goes:

Candidate:
   Here do I swear by, mouth and hand,
     Fealty and service to the Crown and Kingdom of the West,
     to speak and to be silent, to come and to go,
     to strike and to spare, to do and to let be,
     in such matters as concern the Kingdom,
     on my honor and the lawful command of the Crown,
     in need or in plenty, in peace or in war,
     in living or in dying, from this hour henceforth,
     until the King depart from His Throne,
     or death take me, or the world end.
     So say I, <substitute your name here>.
King:
   And this do We hear, nor fail to remember,
     and We, for Our part do swear fealty to you,
     <candidate's name>, and to all your household,
     to protect and defend you with all Our power,
     until We depart from Our Throne, or death take Us,
     or the world end.
     So say I, <King's name here>, King of the West.

I recall the oath I swore in AS XI was somewhat different,
but essentially the same.  I believe this version dates from
AS XV.      signed Waldt von Markheim, KSCA, Golem Pursuivant, West

Message-Id: <5011@pt.cs.cmu.edu>

Greetings to the folk of the Rialto from Ellisif Flakkingskvinne!

I am from an area where camping events are the exception rather than the
norm.  It looks like I might be autocratting a camping event soon, and I
have a question I'd like to ask of those of you more experienced in these
matters.

We are expecting approximately 350-400 people for the event.  Our cook would
like to feed 250.  However, he is concerned that since it is a camping event, 
most people will just bring their own food rather than paying for the feast.
Is this something we need to worry about?  I had been assuming that, given
the choice of bringing one's own food and having to cook it and clean it up,
or just eating the feast, that most people would want to eat the feast (and
that we might end up with a number of people who *want* to be onboard but
didn't get their money in before it filled up).  Typically, large events in
the East fill onboard and generate a waiting list a week or two before the
event.  However, I don't have any knowledge of large camping events, in the
East or elsewhere (Pennsic aside, of course :-) ).

As an aside, the event "proper" is Saturday only, but camping is available
Friday and Saturday nights.  So we're not talking about a long weekend where
they'd have to bring food for other meals anyway.

Does anyone have a feel for whether our expectations are reasonable?

Thank you very much for any assistance you can give!

Greetings to the folk of the Rialto, and most especially Ragnar Thorburgsson,
from Ellisif Flakkingskvinne.

Lack of activities for non-fighters has been a problem at a number of events
I've attended.  Here are some suggestions for additional things to do during
the day:
  - quests, as you pointed out, are sometimes used.  Be warned that if you
    are a smallish group, you may have trouble getting enough obstacles *and*
    having enough people left over to actually compete.
  - gaming tournaments -- backgammon is the most common around here, though
    chess (set a time limit!), nine-man morris, and occasionally others are
    sometimes used.  (Alternatively, just have the game boards available,
    even if you aren't planning a tourney.)
  - arts exhibits/competitions -- but, again, I think this will work better 
    in larger groups (where more than one or two people have stuff they want 
    to show off).
  - short (1 hour max) classes on various subjects.  These could include 
    lectures on all sorts of things (history, arts, ...), workshops,
    etc.  Find out what your people are interested in, and then try to 
    recruit appropriate teachers.  If you recruit teachers from outside
    your group, it will provide an extra incentive for people to come to
    the class at the event.
  - dancing -- this occasionally works, but I've seen it fail more often than
    succeed (mostly due to gender mismatch and the fact that you need several
    people to get it started).
  - entertainment -- give entertainers an area where they can perform during
    the day, or run a competition during the day.  (Last year we moved our
    competition to name the Baroness' Bard from during dinner (which didn't
    work all that well) to the afternoon, and it was *much* nicer for all
    involved.  The audience was smaller, but those who were there were there
    because they wanted to hear the entertainment, not because it was
    happening at dinner and they didn't have a choice.)

You should consider the number of people you're going to have at the event,
and how many it will take to run each activity, in your planning.  Don't
have so many things going on at once that each will only attract a couple 
of people.

Many autocrats make the mistake (well, in *my* opinion it's a mistake) of
trying to set things up so that everyone can do everything.  What usually
happens is that, for instance, the gaming tourney grinds to a halt until the
rattan tourney is over, because half the fighters wanted to play backgammon
too.  The object of providing the other activities is to give the non-fighters
something to do, so don't make them spend most of the afternoon waiting for
the fighters to finish so they can have their turn.  If things conflict, so
be it; people have to make choices from time to time.  (For things like 
gaming tourneys, you can simply rule that people who aren't available within
a certain time limit automatically forfeit the round.)

To all students,
 
If you are not planning on using your computer account regularly this summer,
please have us shut off you SCA-Digest subscription.  
 
Due to the increasing size of the digest, most student accounts will exceed
their quota within one or two weeks.  Moreover, many schools shut off student
accounts over the summer. 
 
The administration of SCAnet is a rather large task.  Notification of your
account dis-use, change, or disconnection helps us keep up to this task.
 
You may notify us by sending a note to: "SCA-Request@mc.lcs.mit.edu"
 
Thank you for attention in this matter.  Have a great summer.

Wow!  Some uncreative anachronists have complained about my posting
(to alt.sca) an *invitation* to some great kinky fun.

I only posted it here because the few people I know who are SCA'ers said they
thought their group might be interested.  You won't find anything at this
upcoming party (June 17, Portland, 10pm to dawn) that you wouldn't have found 
in an Abbey in the 14th century; the main difference is that our indulgences 
are *consensual*.

As the person who posted the "Beware the PennsicLand my son" posting ...

I'd heard of an article (didn't know it was a series) which was a "report"
from Pennsic set a looong time in the future.  It was talking about a
PennsicLand that's more a Disney Land than Pennsic as we know it now.
Things like it being run year round and the like -- though still set
at Coopers Lake.

Justin, I'd appreciate knowing exactly how to procure these articles
you cite.  I'm afraid I don't recognize the name ...

I made my posting as a warning.  But now I'm scared -- people are actually
wanting things which'd LEAD something I very definitely would NOT want to
be involved with.  Sheesh!  I mean, really, *air* *conditioning* at Pennsic!?
*Air* *Conditioning* is supposed to wait until you get to Pizza Hut on
the Sunday night *AFTER* War Court is *OVER*.

Sorry for the outburst.  I just took a walk around the apartment and
am much calmer ...

What I was trying to suggest is that instead of pressing Pennsic to
get even bigger than it is now, to instead develop other large
events but spread around the country.  For instance, I understand
that Estrella is a Large Event (2000 people?) and is, in my opinion,
a Good Thing in that it takes pressure off the Need to Attend Pennsic.

Yes, Pennsic is a Good Event and has many Magical Moments for me and
for all of us who attend it.  However, I have had Magical Moments at
all the events I've attended.  I urge us to consider ways of making
Pennsic less Special.

What am I afraid of?

I am afraid of the Magic being Spoiled and I have a gut feeling that
the larger events grow to be the more likely the Spoilage.

Then there's the observations which amq@rutgers.edu was making last
summer.  For those who don't know she has been actively involved
with the Pennsic Security for a few years.  (Pardon me if I am
getting details wrong, I only know her from last summer).  Being
on the security force she gets to see first hand problems that happen.

Her contention is that problems have been more frequent as the population
has grown.  And that it's just a matter of population pressures heating
up tensions coupled with stastical likelihoods of attracting Bad People.
That is, if the likelihood of Bad People appearing in a population is
some percentage regardless of the size of the population, then the larger
the population the more likely you'll actually get Bad People.  I do
understand that it's not proven that the percentage stays the same
regardless the size of the population...


In service to a time when Pennsic is Just Another Event,

	David le casse'



P.S. If the western part of the Eastern Kingdom eventually forms itself
	into its own kingdom, won't the reason for Pennsic dissappear?
	That is, that that area of the EK isn't served well by the EK
	because of its distance from the bulk of the EK ...

Subject: Re: Is Pennsic out of control?
Message-Id: <13657@ncoast.ORG>

One major problem with Pennsic in terms of reservations is that it is
not a hotel - the level of staff support that the Coopers and Wilvers
can offer is much less, and, most importantly - no rooms.  It is
currently impossible to allocate space on an individual basis as there
are no fixed marks and, in fact, an accurate map does not exist.  

These could be done; however, before Mac Cooper would agree to embedding
thousands of concrete blocks in the ground (to identify camp sites) the
S.C.A. would have to sign a contract with him.  The war has been on a
handshake basis since Pennsic VI (the first on the current site) and
continues that way today.

The only written agreement for many years wasis an agreement between the
two Kingdom Exchequers before Pennsic VI over the allocation of funds
received from the war.

The problem is this:  as the war alternates between the Middle and the
East neither Kingdom could sign a long-term contract.  There have been
attempts in the past to establish some form of organization but they
have never lasted.  

The main reason for the alternation: exhausation.  It is not possible
for either kingdom to run the war year in and year out without seriously
burning out many people (a problem that already exists).  The groups
nearest the War (Debatable Lands in the East and Gwyntarian-Cleftlands
in the Middle) spend several months part-time and several weeks full-time
on the administration of the war (not all members, but a significant
fraction).

I personally think the War is too big; I have a lot more fun at things
like Border Raids with 800 present.  The idea of Pennsic XX with its
probable 8-10K is something I don't want to think about right now.

At Beltain this year in Ansteorra (Barony Namron), we tried some new things.
We performed some Swedish maypole-songs as the populace danced around the
obligatory maypole.  (For some reason, we had found it difficult to find
Maypole dancers.  Seems that the maypole has a 70% (or so) success rate 
in engendering bairns.  Kissing or hugging the maypole is almost certain
conception one's next menstrual cycle).  Then we performed some Swedish
children's games:  "Bjornen sover" (where a child crouches beneath a bear
skin while the dancers do a ring-dance around "the bear", singing that
the bear sleeps in his calm abode, but one can never quite believe that he
is sleeping.  After the song is finished, and before it starts again, the
bear springs and a new bear is selected.)  

Spang hewing was very popular.  This consists of putting frog bean-bags on
a stick and flinging them at a hoop.  The spangs (frogs) collect quite a bit
of mud in the process and become quite slimy.  When they hit their target,
it is with a satisfying -splat-.

I am researching an Old Irish persona and would like to know some good
sources (that I can get through Inter-Library Loan) on pronunciation of
the letters (in other words, how could I document that Cosfhota is 
pronounced cos odda?).

Period places.  What is a good book on places that existed in period Northern
Ireland?

So far, I've determined the root words for long foot (cos = leg, foot, fota
= long .  cos is feminine, and adjectives that follow a noun are lenited. 
Hence:  fhota.)

Message-ID:  <8905191037.aa25416@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>


Ah yes, Fool's Court.  I remember a couple of particularly succesful Fool's
Courts.  To be really good, you need some one with a bizarre sense of humor,
someone who's good at practical jokes. 

 One year a certain Peer was set up to be
the Fool.  We in the kitchen baked a cake with no token, then cut it up into
pieces.  The token was added to one particular piece which was specifically
given to the Peer. Upon discovering he had the token, he didn't announce it,
instead he smuggled it into someone else's piece, who was much dismayed to
discover he was the King of Fools.  This could not be allowed! Without
revealing that we had set him up we had to get the token and put it back in his
cake.  Thereupon the token began appearing and disappearing from various
plates on the high table as each person there tried to escape being the Fool, 
and we finally had to stand over said Peer so that he couldn't do away with 
it yet again.

I remember another time when Eliahu became the Fool King.  This was I believe
at the time when everybody was saying, "If he doesn't win Crown Tourney this
time, he will next time."  Eliahu then chose Count Thaid as his Queen, much to
the amusement of the populace. He further stipulated that the Queen was a
mute, so Thaid couldn't utter a word.  Anyone who knows Thaid can imagine he
must have nearly burst from the effort of keeping silent.  And the the populace
REALLY had fun.  You see, Thaid is the self-appointed buffoon of the North
Woods, and anybody and everybody has been the butt of his humour.  And suddenly
they could pay him back  without him being able to utter a word in his own
defense.  He tried, in sign language, but was totally incomprehensible. 

And then there was the Twelth Night stricken by plague. Someone introduced a
little paper that read, "You have been  stricken by the plague.  Pass this on,
then fall dead."  Very soon the majority of the populace was lying in their
plates.  Baroness Septemtria and Princess Caitlin thereupon discovered that the
Royal Crown had healing properties, and went around curing moaning and groaning
people.  But the plague kept reccuring, and finally they had to track down the
source (the paper) and cure it. That was the same Twelth Night where the Midrealm
Dragon duelled Sylard of Eagleshaven--and won, as Sylard was done in by his own
treachery.  But that's another story.  

True stories, I swear it!

after I started going to fighter practice, after having done nothing but watch
for that time.  I had fun, but then the only thing we did before sparring was
to calibrate so I'd know what a killing blow was, then we were going 
full speed.  It was October in Dallas, still hot, and I couldn't wear my
glasses in the loaner helm.  I had fun.  Sure, the guy I was fighting (who
had been fighting for about 6 months) killed me about once every few seconds,
but I had seen some of the tricks that they had been using and tried to emulate
them, suprising the hell out of Thorkel.  After that I was hooked.  Other than
sparring I had a couple of brief 'formal' train sessions with a local Duke
(who offered me more personal instruction... which I, in my ignorance, turned
down... :-(  )  and some slower sparring with an Earl who paused to explain
what was going on at times.  Other than that it was full speed all the way.

	I've also heard of people getting bored with the non-contact training
and leaving... and I've used that method successfully.  So I think that 
it really depends on finding (as with most things) the right trainer for
your.  Unfortunately, this isn't a luxury that most of us have...  we either
train with whomever is available or do without.

	A good point.  While I do cringe at the thought of some of the
people I know swinging full force, in general people are under control.
We can see this given the rarity of injuries in our combat, in spite
of the potential for mayhem of a 3+ pound stick of wood.  Most of the
injuries I've seen have been either freak accidents, due to slipping
rather than a blow, or due to inadequite or poorly maintained armor
(which I'm as guilt of as anyone.)  A particular area people tend to
armor too lightly are the hands...  especially if you are fighting
polearms.  

	One other problem I have with escalating blow force is that it
makes it harder for some of our people to participate in this side
of our activities.  I've heard of women being actively discouraged
from fighting because they were "too small", a patent falsehood, having
memories of a rather capable lady fighting in an Ansteorran Crown
who also happened to be a small stature, and a Marshall of the Steppes
who was also rather small.  They knew that they, like anyone else
under 6 feet tall, were going to be at a disadvantage at times against
considerably bigger opponents.  They also knew that they could win,
something that some would denigh them.

	First of all, good luck with your event.  It is always needed.

	Second:  Dance *Classes*!!!!

	Both Dragonsmark/Cheval Flambant (Lexington, Ky and Univ. of Ky)
and Carillion/Carillion Keep (Central NJ/Princeton University) have
had great success with dance class events.  Dragonsmark even had
one person come from as far away as Toronto for its Dance only event,
and a total of 80 or so people in attendance.  More over, it is not
too difficult to do.  You need A) rooms, and B) Teachers.  It is a 
relatively simple thing to add and run (certainly simpler than a 
A&S contest or a gaming competition) and one that people seem to enjoy.

	Simple plays, with practices during the day, can involve both
children and adults in limited numbers.  At an event in Nant-y-Dyrwiddon
(spelling?) in Meridies, the children spent the day making papermache
masks and learning a simple dance.  That night, during the feast, they
performed it, much to the delight of the populous.  The whole thing kept
them busy during the day, and lasted about 15 minutes at the feast and was
quite enjoyable.

	There have been various other suggestions that should help.
Have fun!

Does anyone out there know how to contact Peregryne (sp?) Windrider, a bard
formerly (currently?) of the East Kingdom?  (This lady is half of the team
responsible for "Song of the Shieldwall", among many others.)  Thanks very

Message-Id: <1452@hjuxa.UUCP>

For any who may be interested, the winner of the Spring Crown Tourney in the
East is Sir Horic Granavar (Drat, I think that's the spelling). He fought to
honor his lady Lea Grnavar. This should make their mundane wedding more
interesting!

Sir Horic may be known to many as a member of the War-puppies, renouned for
their parties at Pensic.  He may be remembered as the Pensic Head of
Security who warned of _grave_consequences_ to any persons playing music
loudly, and forcing him to take off his walk-man to deal with it.

Sir Horic is probably best known, though, for his Public Health at Pensic
posters, warning all to practice safe sex. ("Sir Horic Says: Safe in War,
Safe in Sex" and "Squire, Sheath that Weapnon")  They were all over the place
last year.  (I think his squire still has complete sets, they may be for
sale now! :-)

Subject: Pennsic (It's never too big, dahling)

All the talk about restricting Pennsic to members or some other way of cutting
atttendance makes me very nervous.  One of the most attractive features of the
SCA for me is everyone's friendliness and hospitality, even to newcomers. 
Also, I like the fact that you don't have to be -official- to be a member -you
are a scadian because you show up and do things, not because you send X bucks
to California.  However, I agree that Pennsic is going to be in serious
trouble if present trends continue.
  Basically, we have two problems.  1) There is just enough land for the
people who show up now, and the facilities are inadequate.  2) In order to get
enough land, and good land, people are showing up so early some of them never
leave, and some people are engaging in obnoxious behavior by taking too much. 
All right, we have three possible solutions:  cut down attendance;  get more
land and increase facilities;  institute rigid bureaucracy to make sure each
person gets exactly his/her fair share and no more.
  I hate bureaucracy.  Most people do.  Let's avoid option three if at all
possible.
  One of the best things about Pennsic is its size.  It attracts merchants
like crazy -you can buy anything you'll ever need at the War.  There are
enough fighters to practice large-scale tactics.  Someone is always doing
*something* interesting.  It's much easier to ignore mundane influences when
surrounded by 5,000 people in a comparatively isolated site than when
sixty of you are surrounded by 5,000 students on a college campus.  Walking
down the road at Pennsic at night  --the unpaved, rocky road lit only by
torches-- was a hell of a lot more real than any church basement.  It's the
equivalence of the country dweller's trip to the big city.  Big, in this one
case, definitely means better.
  So what are we gong to do?  I know nothing about the geography surrounding
Cooper's Lake, but if there is open land nearby that we could expand into,
that would be the best thing.  If we are then spread out too much (as is
already happening) then we'd need to run some sort of shuttlebus
(shuttlewain?).  Improving and expanding showers is a must in any case  --this
is obvious.  I would much prefer this to cutting attendance.  I just hope this
is possible.
  A paid, full time, administrator for the War is a damned good idea.  Of the
proposals bandied about here, I like the concept of holding some space for
single campers.  I also like dividing the land into three non-consecutive
areas,  opening each one at different times, so latecomers still have some
selection.  These sound like a lot less work than the lottery.

Perhaps he should then be known as Prince Sir Horic les Tecques.
[Hint: pronounce it in French.]

If he were in the Dark Horde, he could become a Khan Dom.

Subject: Hitting hard...

Lord Kwellend Njal recently entered the discussion of blow force. I havnt got
his message handy, but if I remember correctly, commenting on someone who 
regularly dented spun top helms, he said that he would throw such a person
off the field immediately and further that he didnt know any member of the
chivalry that would accept such blow force. 

I have only seen one spun top helm, and it didnt dent very easily (maybe it
should have....:-) but my barony as a group has once been told by one knight
that all fighters here struck too lightly. This seems to have had some effect,
because today you can find fighters that hit with substantial force.

I personally tend to think that if a blow is hard enough to penetrate a period
helm, its pretty hard. Very hard, probably. I have heard that the alleged 
reason for taking blows to the head at all is period illustrations which show 
swords splitting helms. On all such pictures I have seen (few, admittedly) the
wielder strikes with a two-handed sword and with all force he can muster. 
This would clearly violate the East Kingdom conventions of combat. Also, I
doubt that we want that kind of force to be used.

My own conclusions are: To stay competetive, I strike medium to hard blows, 
harder in a melee. In my limited experience, these blows are not dangerous
except to fighters with insufficient hand protection. If told, however,
to lessen the force slightly, I would accept, since I dont think that realistic
force is used nor desirable. The force used just have to be good enough as to 
exclude wrist flicks and such, albeit I dont think our current level is
generally dangerous.

I finally got my own copy of a book I saw about 2 months ago, and
it is wonderful!  The title:  _Shoes and Pattens_, one of what is
apparently a series titled _Medieval finds from excavations in London_
It contains textual analysis, as well as *photographs* and line

recent archeological digs in London, primarily on the Thames.

It includes analysis of types of leather used, types of wood (for
pattens), breakdowns by style, size, and a bunch of other methods,
and a huge bibliography.  For anyone interested in shoes (we all
have our fetishes :-) I highly recommend this book.
It even has cutting patterns from disassembled shoes!

In the last digest a posting for clarification was made concerning Michael

Part of the difficulty was personal (a pernicious part), and part was a

zero sum game. For a lot of us the results are still painful to remember.

Subject: On Heraldic Clip Art and Cooperphobia

In one of the volumes of #333, Alan and Amanda mentioned heraldic clip art for
the Macintosh.

I hardly ever use Hypercard (it's much more fun to program than it is to
use), so that wouldn't be the first medium I'd consider.  If you can put 
together a Heraldry Construction Set in Hypercard format, I'd happily play with
it and tell you what I think.

Amanda's Illustrator '88 files are a little closer to what I had in mind.  I'm
torn between working in FullPaint (everybody has some flavour of paint program)
or in something like Illustrator (Aldus FreeHand) in order to get better
results on a laser printer.  Most of us don't have lasers, though.  (YET.)
Any ideas?

I envision something like a heraldic version of "Colorforms", where you could
choose a shield shape, stick a division on it, specify colours, place charges
on it, and voila!  It would be a lot of fun to play with.

Chelidon mentioned something (I think in #334) that I kinda found scary.  Pardon
my paraphrase, but he said something to the effect of "If the Coopers get wind
of our plans to find our own site, will they be as responsive to our problems?"

Well, I hope it would put a little bit of fear into them.  Perhaps the prospect
of our looking for another place will give them the idea that they will no
longer be a monopoly.  So far we have been forced to play the game their way.
No pre-Pennsic reservations.  Facilities that would adequately serve half our
number.  Diminishing land.  Bathrooms that don't function properly.  And now,
fees that go to further line their pockets rather than into our own site fund.

Yes, Chelidon, they had damn well better be more responsive to our problems. 
If I understand it correctly, we constitute enough income so that they could
stay closed the rest of the year if they wanted to.  The prospect of losing
that could possibly make them see that keeping us would be worthwhile, even if
it means they have to put a little bit more of those exorbitant profits back
into the site.

It would do us well to continue looking for another site.  In manufacturing,
this is called "second-sourcing" -- finding another supplier with whom to do
business in case the original supplier falls down on the job.

someone ask him whether it would be ok. Also, while it would be wonderful to

Well, having once been on a long tour of the grounds, I can assure you
that the Coopers have *lots* of land.  Some of it would take some machete
to make it into usable camping space, but my impression is that it's not
so much sheer acreage that's the problem, but the support structure.  The
Coopers are very well equipped to handle "normal" camping, but staff and
facilities that serve very well for 11 months out of the year are simply
inadequate for handling Pennsic these days.  Now, we do help by managing
ourselves as much as possible, with medical and communications people (i.e.,
chirurgeons and heralds), and simply by having enough of a sense of community
that we help each other out a lot (for example, the Horde, inns, and other
groups providing shelter and warm food for people who have had their
camps mangled by the annual Storm Of Great Ferocity And Note).

However, as someone else has pointed out, the logistics are getting
pretty hairy.  Providing sufficient clean water and sanitary facilities
is one of the major problems, just from a safety standpoint.

One approach is to restrict attendance.  I see the point of this, and I must
admit some distaste for a lot of what I've seen at the War.  I don't think
the solution is as simple as making it "members only," but I haven't come
up with anything myself either.  The SCA is a lot bigger than it used to
be, which is both

Despite the rather biting humor of Master Yosef Alaric (or, say, some of
the scenes from _Escape_Velocity_ :-)), a more "official" setup would
have its advantages.  I'm enough of an old-timer to wince at this, though...

SCA Membership
I respect the opinions of everyone on the net, and not least the
opinions of Duke Cariadoc and Baroness Jehanne.
 
What I'm reiterating here is not to change their minds, but merely
clarify what I said, and why I said it.
 
The membership fee I advocate is $6 US, not $20.  $20 buys a tank
of gas.  $6 will get you a fast food dinner for two.
 
I agree that simply obtaining a membership will not guarantee
behaviour.  I agree that some of the bad actors at Pennsic are
members.
 
When I sign a piece of paper and give over money, I have made
some kind of commitment.  In the case of the SCA, the people
who play this game gain: friends, resources, environment,
activities and the banner of the SCA over all.  The SCA lends
you its name and authority when you say you are part of it.
I believe that you owe the SCA something in return for this.
 
I am not saying that the SCA is the BOD or the California
administration.  (I am not displeased, however, that a portion
of my membership fee goes to support the Steward and the membership
secretary).  The SCA is more than the BoD, the administration,
or any of its members.  It is a concept with traditions and
history, and it's our umbrella raison d'etre when we recreate
the Middle Ages.  I personally am grateful for that umbrella,
and willing to contribute to supporting the superstructure, which
largely exists for our benefit.
 
I do not value an administration layer for its own sake, believe me.
As a chronicler, I have had my discussions with our Kingdom and
our local chronicler about the successive restrictions
placed on local chroniclers.  (When I joined, local newsletters
were discouraged and you had to print a disclaimer.  Now, local
Baronial newsletters are mandatory, and you have to print a different
disclaimer).  I mention this only to show that I am not overly
in love with all the rules.  (If Mistress Siobhan is reading, please
don't take offense, or
feel obliged to reply to the newsletter issue, as (1) I
understand the reasons for the rules (2) I am conforming to them.)
 
What we have done locally to support the SCA and impoverished
members is to buy them memberships for their birthdays or for
Christmas.  We have transported people to events for free, when
we could, and they could not pay.
Those of us who are doing better help those who
are doing less well.   I certainly agree with Jehanne that $20
US is right out for some people, though they can manage to
get to events now and then.  However, if you can afford to
go to Pennsic, you can afford a $6 membership.
 
What the sponsoring of non-members does is to make people think
a little more about what they are doing.
Also, we are supposed to have some disciplinary recourses if
members misbehave, which we don't have with non-members.
 
The closing of Pensic to non-sponsored non-members avoids
vast numbers of people sailing in at the Gates on Friday and
Saturday just on spec.
I've helped run a convention, and I've sat on troll booth at
War, and I've helped run the local group for 11 years.  These
are simply observations of fact:  you have more leverage over
members, if this becomes necessary.
 
Someone who is a member of the SCA may have had time to absorb
the culture of the SCA.  Someone who is not a member may not.
Membership is no guarantee that the person will be courteous to
women or other people in general, but it seems to help.
A non-member with the right attitude shouldn't have much trouble
being sponsored, should they?
 
There have been problems at Pensic because the Coopers have said
it was up to us to enforce discipline.  The SCA autocrats have
looked to the Coopers on occasion, to enforce certain basic
rules (rules which they admitted that had their mundane campers
violated in other months of the year, the said campers would
have been out on their ears).
 
I would sure rather go somewhere where people either practiced
chivalric courtesy, or they practiced to John Stuart Mill's
philosophy (see his essay On Liberty)
pagan courtesy (do what you will, an' it harm none) or
that other English philosopher (?) (do anything you like so long as it
doesn't disturb the horses).
 
So, I'm advocating that we encourage (not force)
membership first on the grounds that it encourages
responsible behaviour, and second on the grounds of duty or gratitude.
 
Again, these are my beliefs, I have not forced on people locally or
anywhere else.  My idea of encouragement includes:
 
- different site fees ($1 or $2 difference)
- buying memberships for the indigent
- occassional membership raffles
- discussing the benefits of membership, IF asked
- lavishly praising people who become members
 
I occasionally have discouraged people from membership if I thought
they were doing it because they thought they had to, to participate.
(The last person I did that to has lives in an isolated part of
territory claimed by our Barony.  He's not only bought a sustaining
membership, he called me recently to check on an SCA name to submit
it under!)
 
I have gone on far too long.  I really don't mind if you disagree,
so long as we're all clear on where and how we disagree.
My respect to all of you on the Rialto, and friends-

For those of you who don't know (I assume Kwellend you forgot or
things have changed recently) Ansteorran Crown Princes are crowned
relatively quickly. Patrick's coronation will be July 1,2 and he
will step down  Jan 19-21,1990.  What other kingdoms besides the
East have Crown Prince for 6 months then King for 6 months?

I like the idea of 'training' your monarch-to-be for 6 months,
but now someone wishing to be King must be willing to commit
his time and energy (and money) for an entire year. Any problems
with this? Here, the commitment is more like 8 months.

True.  I think the powers that be want to avoid the thinking
"Win a crown, get a belt." Don't take that as a denigration
of Kingdoms where that does happen, remember I'm guessing.
I would think they want the flexibility to not belt a king
without it appearing as a mortal insult.

Note: All references to King/Crown Prince/etc. should be
taken as non-gender specific. One of the favorites to win
at present day crowns here is always Duchess Rowen. I assume
there are other worthy and competent female fighters on the
brink (Sir Fern?).

Message-Id: <2297@Portia.Stanford.EDU>

Greetings from Hal Ravn:

Old stories about the Society, huh?  Here are a couple from the West
dating back about 15 years.  Both were at Twelveth Night, but different
years . . . 

When what is now Caid was still part of the West (as I recall they weren't
even a Principality yet), one XIIth Night, Andrew of Riga was crowned.
A contigent had come up from the Barony of the Angels (Los Angeles) and
were doing a little ceremonial presentation of kingly gifts--Gold, 
Franckicense, and Myrrh.  Andrew, as it happens was Jewish.  I made 
arrangements to have my household do a presentation *immediately* after
the Angels.  Lady Vesper Herald took great delight in announcing that
House Ravnsgaard was presenting His Majesty--Lox, Cream Cheese, and Bagels!

(Andy looked down at me and said, "God'll get you for that, Hal!")

--------

At another XIIth Night, they were just stating to pass the cake with
the token in to pick the Lord and Lady of Misrule.  I was about the
3rd or 4th person to take a piece.  I took one randomly from the middle
of the cake and came up with the token!  After a an exchange of shocked
looks (it was much to soon to announce that the Lord of Misrule had been
found), I palmed it.  After the cake had been going around for a while,
I got back to it, took another piece and we *discoverd* that I had the
token.

The problem with being Lord of Misrule is that nearly everybody has things
they'd rather do than watch somebody find victims to make idiots of.
We did find one thing to do that turned out to be interesting, entertaining,
and even enlightening.  We had all available Heralds brought to us and
had them *demonstrate* Heraldic positions.  You know--a Herald rampant,
a Herald statant, a Herald regardant, etc. etc.  The really tough one
was "a Herald volant."  It's hard to keep them in the air long enough . . .
In the end, I think even the Heralds had a good time with this nonsense.

Subject: To all heralds on the Rialto

To all heralds who visit the Rialto, greetings!

I am planning to lead a round table discussion at the Heraldic
Symposium on "Possible applications of Computers to Conflict
Checking". I asked for a session on this subject during a Caid
Heralds' meeting that lasted from 11:00 a.m. to 8:15 p.m.

Even if the new rules make it easier to determine whether a conflict
exists, it will still be necessary to find all possibly-conflicting
armoury. The current method of searching an ordinary that is
pre-sorted into classifications that may or may not help narrow the
search for a particular device, is truly medieval.

My thesis is that the armorial is not THAT big, personal computers
are getting more powerful with bigger disks, a lot of us have access
to more powerful computers, and some cleverness in encoding and
pre-indexing could reduce the problem substantially. With
computerised searching, we would need only the armorial and not the
ordinary. 

I do not think the current state of artificial intelligence and
expert systems will permit a fully computerised conflict checker.
What I am looking for is something that can find the 10 or so
devices that COULD conflict, based on superficial examination. I
think human heralds will still have to set up the search rules, and
examine the possible conflicts in the light of the rules of
difference.

I am sure I cannot be the only person to have this idea.

If you have ideas, or better  still on-going  work in  this area that
you are willing to discuss, please come to the symposium if possible.
If you cannot come to the symposium,  please send  me any information
or ideas.  

Yours in service (but hoping to reduce the amount of it spent
scanning the ordinary and updates)

Subject: Newbies; Seeking Another Song

Does anyone have a copy of the words to "I Wish I Had a Period Tunic?"

Are large events a bad place to take newbies?  Nonsense!  My first event was
the Crown Tourney that Vissevald II won.  I didn't have time to get drunk,
naked, laid, or even dressed properly; I was cooking the feast.

Given the choice, I would always gladly take a newbie to a large event.  There's
more going on, and if the newbie gets bored watching the fighting, he/she might
prefer to look at the A&S exhibition or visit the merchants.  I am, however,
very much in favour of making sure that every newbie has somebody to go with.
That way, even the shyest person will have someone he/she knows to talk to, or
to explain what's going on.

I also try to make it clear at shire meetings that newbies need not pay the
$20 until they've decided that this is what they want -- although getting the
Pikestaff is a tremendous advantage, and it's worth $20 just to have the
information it contains.  Most people in our shire buy their memberships
within three months.

As for newbies running loose, unattended, preying on our sheep and our
resources: There are those who've paid the $20 who'll do the same thing.  I
don't see anything wrong with a $1 or so discount at events to members (every
other club and professional association in the world does it, and there ought
to be some perks to go along with supporting the Corporation).  Note I said
"discount to members", though.  Although the price is still the same, it's a
different idea than "higher prices for non-members."  (Semantics is a wonderful
thing...)

you in good health and spirits. MaAyt shel - Yonatan Moshe bereb Avram Yitzhak.

As I promised in the last digest I am continuing with references for costumes.
Todays installment is specifically designed (no pun intended :) for Russian and
Baltic costumes. I have discussed my bibliography with several local Scadians
and come to the conclusion that including dialect and obscure language sets
may be more frustrating than helpful to beginners and intermediate people. I
am therefore limiting this installment to French, English, Polish, and
Russian - and then only to easily understood books. I am not duplicating
the better (and more frequently suggested) books already in service among
Scadians. This reference list stretches the available set and supplements it
(I hope). As usual I am including some travelogues that really should be read
for their insight and commentary. So, here we go...
Burnes, A.
1837 Travels in Bokhara in 1830. London.
Demidov, A.N.
1840 Voyage dans la Russie Meridionale et La Crimee... execute en 1837. Paris.

Dubnow, S.

I sincerely hope that this relatively simple offering will be of some

know where these materials are and if you have TRIED and can not find them

Dorothea of Caer-Myrddin sends greetings to the fishers along the Rialto.

Although I have never been to Pennsic, and only a miracle (with
dollar signs on it) would get us there this year, I have been
following the Pennsic news on the net with great interest.
Assorted ideas have been sprouting and dying in my mind, concerning
the land space / reservation problem.  I need to ask a couple
of questions.

According to various postings, the Coopers insist on no reservations
in advance, all money to be paid on entry.

But it appears they are willing to let the Society folk do a lot of
internal management on their own within the boundaries--heralds,
chirurgeons, innkeepers, et cetera ... and people who show up early
to save space for their friends.

Do you suppose they would agree (or at least not actively object) to
a large-scale, Society-run, organized place-holding service?

I am thinking of a system where groups, or individuals, would send
a dollar or so per head (or 5 cents per square foot, or something
like that) for the privilege of having the place-holders mark off
and hold (with the aid of maps, markers, and a few Dukes and other
ruffians) their places till they got there.  They would thus trade
some money up front for not having to arrive early; it could be
made to come out to costing less than an extra week's (two weeks',
etc.) camping expenses.

It would still take much organization, surveying, etc etc... but
I think it could work.  

If anyone knows of an immovable, non-negotiable (e.g., Coopers)
reason why this wouldn't work, let me know; if not, I can start
thinking about systems and procedures.... though the people you'd
find most useful in getting it set up  and making it work are
those who have run successful science fiction conventions.

Greetings!  Although I am very new to this network, I see that you
all are discussing a the subject of "how to tell who is a member of
the SCA".  This is a topic which has concerned me as Seneschal of a
small shire which must constantly watch expenditures.  (I realize that
this is merely an branch of the larger discussion--but here goes:)


Without a definitive membership list provided by the parent group--so
to speak--we find it very difficult to maintain a list of who to notify
of activities, emergencies, etc.  As a Shire, we have only about 20
sustaining members, but we print 50 copies of the newsletter each month.
It would be nice to say, your subscribers are your members, but this
list changes monthly, since we have a large student population and have
to give them the option of purchasing the issues individually, rather
than subscribe per year.  We also don't know for sure what area we
cover, since we have no authoritative membership list to consult.

Can anyone out there give me information on how your groups have dealt
with these sorts of problems?

Mistress Niccola asks about alternatives to membership as ways of
determining who comes to SCA events. My general answer is to try, so far
as possible, to put on events that the people you do not want will not
enjoy and will therefore (if warned) not come to.  We made it clear in the
announcement for our recent event that it was more period in tone than
most, and that we wanted people to make an effort to avoid coke cans and
the like. We announced, and held, no contests and no elimination lists. I
assume one reason it went well was that people who were uncomfortable with
what we were doing did not come. Our encampment at Pennsic, which requires
people to have period-looking equipment and stay in persona all the time
they are within its boundaries, is intended to do the same thing in a more
extreme form. 

I may be wrong, but I suspect one unspoken assumption behind the way a lot
of events are organized (SCA murder-mystery events, for instance, or the
ubiquitous contests in one sort or another of unmedieval silliness) is
that many of the people present will not enjoy doing medieval things, and
must therefor be provided with unmedieval things to do. That policy is
also a filter, but one that, in my judgement, filters out the people you
want and in the people you do not want.

some time after his surgery, and he appeared well and happy.

Subject:  True History of Michael of Boarshaven

by Dame Enid
(Baron Henry is kindly posting this for me, as my postings seem not to be
reaching the Net.)

Lord Tim: I'm responding to your request for corrections and information
on Michael of Boarshaven. I was active at that time and witnessed most of
the major events of that reign. Rivenstar was our closest group and many
of the people involved I count as friends. I still possess the text of
Michael's letter of resignation, which was posted on Plato at the time.

You are wrong on a few major points. I don't blame you at all, you were
not there, as you say.

Sir Albert was Michael's Tanist. The runner up in that Tourney was Earl
Dagon.

Michael was Sir Polydor's squire, and as you say, he was an excellent
fighter. Fighting was what he liked best, and it is said he never
attended a feast until the day he won Crown Tourney.

Michael entered a Crown Tourney without a lady. When it became clear he
was likely to win, a lady was chosen for him. I do not know the reasoning
behind it, that Crown Tourney was my first event.

Zarina was the Kingdom MoA and a Tarkeena in the horde. She was felt to
be knowledgeable enough about the Kingdom to be an advisor and helper to
Michael, who admitted himself to knowing little about how things were
run. Zarina accepted the post. I don't believe she knew Michael very
well, and certainly was never romatically attracted to him.

Once they were on the thrones, Michael did not take kindly to Zarina's
advice. (In those days, it was typical for the Queen to be a pretty
cipher, and not to interfere in M*E*N*S business). First he dealt with it
by withdrawing and making her his Regent. (This lasted a couple of
months, I believe. It spanned the December, because Zarina held court as
Regent at the Christmas Tourney in Barony of the Flame). She and the rest
of us had a lovely time during that period. Moonwulf was Captain of the
Queen's Guard at that time.

In January Michael was back. At the Festival of Maidens in Wurmwald the
event was autocratted by Zarina and cooked by Marc Etienne de Bouthillier
(who had succeeded Zarina as KMOA). Everything seemed fine. The Royalty
processed into court to the strains of Masterpiece Theatre. There seemed
to be much give and take on between Zarina and Michael as they presented
the awards (on that day Johanna Llyn Lewis received both an AoA and a
Fret, for example.)

Then, towards the end of Court, I saw Princess Selene, who was sitting at
Her Majesty's right, take her hand and squeeze it. Then Zarina called up
her champion and released him. Everyone cheered, because they thought it
was because he was getting married. (I believe it was Corin du Soleil).

Then she called up her Guard and released them. Nobody said anything.

Then she said that she was resigning, because Michael and she disagreed
about honour.

Zarina didn't get more than a few sentences out, because she was crying.
She then left the podium, the Prince and Princess with her. Someone
called out "Three cheers for Zarina", which we gave. The Queen's Guard
marched out with her. The rest of the people in front left, until Michael
was sitting in his throne all alone, with only Earl Sir Bearanger near by.

Then we all left. I and my two riders went to find somewhere to get a
drink. It was snowing. I was broadsided by a truck and narrowly escaped
losing my face as the driver's side window shatterred. It was my third
event.

About a month later, some of the Mynydd Seren people (it was then called
Neorxnawang) were at an event in Illinois). They came home and were
telling us about court. It came out that their highnesses did not sit
with him, but rather in the audience. It was then that I realized that
there was something desperately wrong, and that he was unlikely to finish
the reign.

I believe that Michael must have resigned in late March or early April.
We were concerned because Kalamazoo was hosting the decennial of the
Society, and who would represent us as our King?

Albert was pronounced King by Board of Directors decree, and ruled as
such until his Coronation. Albert was crowned by Duke Sir Andrew, as
premier peer of the Midrealm. (He was called upon as such. Duke Cariadoc
was in the East at that time.)

I remember that event (it was held in Treegirtsea) as being an occasion
for hilarity and rejoicing. Two comedians came in white T-tunics and
bowler hats, calling themselves Laurel-O and Stanley-O. They did "That
was no lady-that was my wife" and sang "My Bonny Lass She Smelleth".
Arwen and Thomas sang the Cuckoo's nest. Theodora danced.

At Court, Zarina, who was not there, was declared Countess, and made a
lady of the Rose.

When the Pale came out, Michael was listed as having been created Count.
It was not however, announced at Coronation Court.

The business about the Crown in detailed in Michael's letter of
resignation (both letters of resignation were sent to the Pale but not
printed. You can ask Mistress Catherine Aimee or Sir Fern.)

He said that he resigned on the understanding that a new Crown Tourney
would be held, as detailed under Midrealm law and Corpora. He claimed he
was promised that this would happen, or he would never have resigned.

(The letter complained of many other things, including the the complaint
that he disliked "strange ladies sitting in my lap".)

Michael bore a grudge against Albert, because Albert had taken Zarina's
side, and also because Albert thought Michael was an unsafe fighter (more
on that below).

Michael therefore would not cede the Crown, and a mundane small claims
action was started against him. I don't believe that they actually had to
go to Court to get the Crown back, though.

One of the first acts of Albert's reign was to ban Michael from the list.
This was based on many safety violations, one of which I witnessed at the
aforementioned festival of Maidens.

Michael would not wear a chin strap. He was fighting Moonwulf. Moonwulf
has a particular sequence where he strikes the first blow and then comes
round again.

The first blow took off Michael's helm. Moonwulf pulled the second blow,
or Michael would surely have died. (He had a steel plate in his head from
the motorcycle accident.)

Michael was no more seen after the recovery of the Crown.

A change to midrealm law was made that everyone entering Crown Tourney
must be fighting for a lady. (And yes, female fighters it still said
"lady". The change came in 1976. Zarina was one of the first authorized
fighters. She authorized at Mynydd Seren's first event by King Albert and
Baron Moonwulf).

It is commonly said that Moonwulf fought for Zarina to make her a Duckess
(not a typo). I remember that Coronation as being more full of flashbulbs
than a big wedding.

Some time after their reign, which was prosperous and happy, Zarina
accepted a job in California.

It has been 13 years, and more since the reign of Michael and Zarina. My
apologies for the length of the posting, but I felt it was worth sharing
with the Net. Any who wishes may print this account (I'd prefer that you
cut, but not change my words, if length is a problem).

	I'm on both sides of this.  On one hand, I don't like the idea
of swinging a weapon at someone's head without them wearing a helm and 
perhaps a gorget, regardless of speed.  On the other hand, saying that 
putting on armor means that you will be going full speed doesn't make 
sense either... given that I've gone less than full speed with people 
in full armor lots of times, both beginners and experienced folk.

	Also, how many of us fought our *first time* in someone else's
armor?  My first time was in the baronial loaner armor, carpet with some
plates rivited to it, and the baronial loaner helm (a truely appalingly
dinged spangenhelm.)  Like one other gentle that has posted, I could see
beans without my glasses.  In some ways this worked out well though, I 
learned early on that you could see what someone was doing by watching
the body (even behind a shield) as well as the sword (which was good, 
as I couldn't see movements much less than 3-4 inches with the sword!)
The biggest change that I noted when I finally did get my helm and could
wear my glasses was in my offence, not my defence...  suddenly I could see
LEG!!! (Whap!)  :-)  Though my defence did tighten up some as well.

	In the end though, I think that the secret to safe practicing, 
be it armored or not, is that you make certain that the newest and the
most experienced are together... and *never* let two beginners fight
each other.  Let them get some experience first.  Lots of it if you can.

The payment method should be negotiable.  Pennsic--while I'm sure it's
lot of work--has got to be a major source of income.  One approach
is to suggest that you are trying to make their life easier.  Another
thing to consider here, is--does the Society collect a site fee for
the Society's own overhead in running Pennsic?  If so, that would
be what was collected by the registration system.

Monies paid in any sort of pre-reg system are merely an incentive to
make your wishes known.  It's easier to get the point over by making
people part with hard-earned cash, but there are other levers.  One
is--if the Autocrat is doing camp-site allocation--to give a higher
priority to those individuals and groups who let their wishes be
known early.  Another is great for those that have a real problem
moving their encampment--file early and get a site you like, secure
in the knowledge that no one will ask you to move.

Look at it as the same problem that a hotel faces--how do you fit
people into the available space.  You have the extra added problem
that the space is continuous and the "guests" have variable space
requirements.  This later leads to another, minor, suggestion--
a small charge based on square-footage.  This would encourage
people to conserve space--maybe the stakes on you sun-shade can be
set in a foot or two . . .

You might want to get in touch with the Trustees of the West Kingdom
Land Fund.  It is run semi-independently from the Society (although
I *think* that there is some arrangement with the BoD--check with
the Trustees!).  I can supply contacts if you need them.

At least there is precedent for doing something of the sort--so you
wouldn't be working completely blind.

The West Kingdom Land Fund has been going for about 15 years.  So far it
has around $60,000--so a War site Fund is not going to be a short term
project, no matter how good you are at "picking pockets".  (The big
fund rasier in the West is the annual Ducal Prize Tourney--it was
started by Duke James Greyhelm--over Labor Day weekend.  Last year
it raised just over $10,000--about 3 times the previous record, so
don't be *too* pesimistic about how long it would take you to raise
what you need.)

or so, Earl Master Lloyd von Eaker fought Vicount Sir Simon of Boardermarch
in a final bout for the crown of Ansteorra that lasted 45 minutes. (In May...
in San Antonio, TX...)  At some point in the bout Master Lloyd made much
the same mistake that Master Corwin did... throwing a wrap shot that missed 
and hit himself.  The story has it that Lloyd was so tired he didn't even 
realize that he had hit himself, he thought that Simon had hit him, so he
fell down.  Simon stood there looking very surprised, since he hadn't swung
a blow... and the marshal walked over to Lloyd, prodded him with a polearm
and said "Get up, there 'ill no suicides on my list field."  Lloyd went on
to win the bout and the tourney.

Greetings, gentles.

East Kingdom Crown Tournament was fought Saturday in the Barony of
Carillion.  The new Crown Prince and Crown Princess of the East are
Horic and Lea.  Their Highnesses live in Ostgardr.  Before his
knighting, Sir Horic was squire to Viscount Edward Zifran of Gendy.

There were 35 fighters in the Crown list, few for the East these days.
Speculation had it that many of the "big guns" sat out because they
want to be King at Pennsic XV and at the 25th Year celebration.  The
other finalist in the tournament was Viktor von dem Kleinflusse.  He
was defeated in the fifth bout of a best-of-5 final.  The other
semi-finalists were Sir Magnus Bloodaxe and Lord Wulfstan
Thorvaldsson.  

The event was autocratted by Lord Bart the Bewildered, who did a fine
job.  The evening's feast was a great success, and everyone seemed to
have a wonderful time.  The highlights of Court were a Silver Crescent
for Baron Marten Broeker for his work as Badger Herald and as War
Herald at Pennsic last summer, and a Laurel for Master Berowne of
Arden for heraldic artwork.  It was a good day for the heralds!

Robyyan writes, about his training system: 

"It has worked very well for the people that have followed me through the
entire program - not many, at this point, because they usually don't want
to take the time to learn the basics they really need, but go off and
spar."

That, of course, is one of the problems with a training system in which it
takes a long time before people do anything that feels like fighting--and
is fun. In our group, training is very decentralized. When a new person
arrives, one of us gives him the standard lecture: Everyone who has been
fighting for more than a week will be glad to tell you exactly how you
ought to fight, and they will all tell you different things. It is up to
you to decide what you think works for you. 

One of our people, who is quite a strong unbelted fighter, has been trying
to use a pattern of training vaguely like what Robyyan describes, although
I think much less extreme. That is to say, he has people doing lots of
drills without armor before they get to do anything that resembles
fighting. Generally the people don't show up at the next practice. Of
course, he may do a worse job of it than Robyyan. I noticed that at the
most recent practice he had a new person and was sparring with him, so he
may have changed his theory of how to train.

My own system is to put the person in armor, show him the basics,  and get
him doing sword practice (we keep a fixed position--feet 'nailed to the
floor,' he hits, I block,  and explain what he is doing wrong) and shield
practice (I hit, mostly slowly, he blocks, and I explain what he is doing
wrong). In theory I would like the first few training sessions to consist
of that, but what usually happens is that fighters are doing at least some
sparring on the first or second session.  

Fighting involves three basic skills--use of sword, use of shield, use of
feet. The advantage of sword practice and shield practice (which I think
is how I was trained by my Master, Edwin Bersark--but it was a long time
ago) is that you are learning one at a time (you learn the feet part
during sparring, after you have some idea of what to do with sword and
shield).

One of the things I find odd about Robyyan's system is the idea of
starting with single-sword, including sword blocks. That sounds like
teaching someone to play golf by first handing him a tennis racket. The
use of sword in sword and shield, at least as I fight it, is quite
different from its use in single-sword. Indeed, I try to train people not
to normally use sword blocks. Blocking with the sword may sometimes be
necessary in an emergency, but it means that you cannot block and strike
at the same time, so it should not be a part of the normal form. That, at
least, is how the form I fight and teach works.  What he is doing sounds
more suitable for teaching someone who is going to end up fighting
two-sword.

Pennsic: Response to Enid Aurelia.

I made the basic points in response to Nicolla. It would be nice if we
could keep people out who do not belong, but the suggested method will not
do it. Many of the people Enid describes are members, and most have
friends (or can find friends) who are members. If, as Enid argues, the
cost of membership is small compared to the cost of Pennsic, then the
people she describes will become members for Pennsic if necessary (one
membership for three people would do, under the system she describes). 

So at best, what she has is not a filter that keeps people out who don't
belong but merely a way of increasing the number of people who have paid
their money to the Corporation for a membership. Many people, including
those who support higher event fees for non-members, seem to think that is
a good idea, but I am not sure why. I can see that there are benefits to
having more members of the Society--that is to say, more people who are
doing interesting medieval things--but what is the benefit to having more
members of the Corporation--that is, more people who have sent $20 to the
Board and get TI and a newsletter in exchange?  If people do not value TI
and the newsletters at what they cost, why should we want them to buy them?

A second point, which my Lady Wife likes to make. Telling people at their
first event that they are allowed to come, but only if they pay more than
the rest of us, is inhospitable. Hospitality is both a medieval virtue and
a way of making groups grow. 

Dame Enid writes:

"Democracy does not mean that everybody is allowed to go anywhere and do
anything without commitments or responsibility.  Democracy means that
anyone is ALLOWED TO TAKE ON COMMITMENTS (become a member) and to be a
part of our game, PROVIDED they follow the rules."

I like the sentiments, but do not see what they have to do with the
argument. Why is becoming a member the relevant commitment? It does not
prevent people from being drunk, talking about television programs and
computers at events, being rude to ladies, or any of the things we want
people to be committed not to do. What does becoming a member have to do
with following the rules? Lots of members don't follow the rules, and lots
of non-members do. 

A (true) story. There is a new person (John) who has been coming to our
fighter practice for some weeks. I mentioned recently that I was using
horsehair for armor padding, and was looking for a source where I could
buy more (what I am using came out of an old mattress before it was thrown
away). John told me that he had a catalog from a place that sold horsehair
from when he was involved in American Indian things and would bring it.
The next time I saw him was at our event, which we were trying to make a
more-than-usually-medieval one. He walked up to me and handed me a cloth
drawstring bag as a gift--with the catalog inside it. He is not a member,
and is following the rules. Most members, in the same situation, would
have handed me the catalog, with some out-of-persona explanation. 

When I joined the SCA, the lowest class of membership was defined as
anyone who showed up at an event properly dressed. That is the relevant
commitment--not the willingness to send $20 to California.

Subject: Lotsa short bits

Having just received the past 5 days' worth of Rialto traffic (a daunting
prospect, to be sure) --

Pennsicland -- Those tossing this name around are *strongly* advised to
procure, by fair means or foul, a copy of Yosef Alaric's series of articles,
"There We Were", which traces the history of the 34th, 45th, and 260-some-oddth
Pennsic Wars (I've heard rumors of an earlier, 23rd Pennsic version, but I'm
not sure it really exists). A very sobering (although by no means sober)
study of where we might be going if current trends continue. Please understand:
referring to the site as "Pennsicland" is *NOT* necessarily a compliment...

Pennsic as a first event -- I also have to disagree with Niccola -- Pennsic
can be a *very* good first event. Several of my close friends got their
start there. Yes, some of the novices get underfoot, but most pick up on
what's right and what's not *very* fast. I've seen people acclimate to the
Society in under 24 hours at Pennsic, much faster than happens anywhere
else...

Pennsic for members only? -- *Ick*. I'd be tempted to let my membership lapse 
specifically as a protest. Yes, some of the non-SCA people hurt the atmosphere.
A lot of them help it significantly. For every wannabe Tuchux in a loincloth
and mirrored shades, there's one who's doing it a lot better than most of the
SCAdians in ripstop nylon tents (a sin against authenticity of which I am
as culpable as any). And, annoying though it can get, the nightly howls
really help give one the feeling that one is in the middle of a war...

(I'd better stop before this turns into a flame. I break into hives every time
that the SCA, Inc. and the Society start blurring...)

National Guard water at the War -- aren't we already doing this? I saw several
of the famed khaki "water buffaloes" at Pennsic, and had assumed that they
were from the Guard. They still aren't enough, though (and, boy, does that
water get hot at midday...).

Shutting off water at the War -- I hadn't heard that the Coopers were doing
this, and would be surprised if they were. It's much more likely that
Trimaris was just "downstream" in the water pipes from our Carolingian
encampment (the one that Cynthia described with the swamp underneath it).
I've heard that water out of those pipes was quite erratic until we put
it all together and realized that there had been a main break (which the
Coopers fixed quite promptly once we brought it to their attention).

More SCA history stories here -- Hear, hear! I thank Awilda for the
story of Corwin Corwinsbane; I'd heard the story before, but had always
assumed it to be apocryphal. And it would be marvelous if Cariadoc were
willing to tell the story of the origin of Pennsic here; it's a
fascinating tale...

Message-ID:  <8905151455.aa02541@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>


Milord Chelidon,

Basically I agree with your points about self-defense.  Whatever you do, know what
you're doing.  This means getting training and planning ahead.  The particular
people I know who used their swords to defend themselves were trained, and
had good reason to fear for their safety. These are not apocryphal tales, they
are real incidents.If you are interested in details, I will call them up and 
ask permission to print their stories.

I also disagree with some of your points. A spirited resistance is better even 
if you don't have training than is passive acceptance.    You are more likely
to escape and to escape unharmed if you resist.  However, if you resist and
fail to escape, then you are more likely to be hurt.  On the other side of the
coin, if you cooperate with your attacker, you will be hurt, but probably not
as much.  But beware, a passive victim encourages some assailants to act out
their fantasies, and their victims are hurt very badly.  

For myself, I choose resistance.  Knowing that I am guarenteed to be hurt, 
possibly severely if I cooperate, I figure the risk of resistance is worth it.  
Fortunately, I have never come to blows with an assailant. I have so far
managed to intimidate potential attackers into leaving. (I lived in a bad 
neighborhood at a time when my physical disablity was  obvious. I was exactly 
the kind of person who was a popular victim: A woman alone physically incapable 
of escape or defense.) 

So when I buy a weapon, I want a real weapon because I have been in dangerous 
situations in the past, and maybe be so again.  1 in 4 Americans is mugged, 9
out of 10 American women are sexually assaulted at sometime in their life.

But something that also matters to me is the integrity of the object.
Something that just looks good isn't a real sword.  It's a fake, a lie, a
deliberate obscuring of the truth.  It is an attempt to impress the viewer
without having anything worthy of respect to back it up.  I feel about such
things the same way I feel about braggarts.  "Put up or shut up."  

What is the point in paying for mediocrity or even down right incompetence?  
I would rather take the same amount of money and go to a SCA artisan and buy a 
piece from him that I knew was the best he could make it.  It might not be a 
superb piece, but it is better to reward and encourage people who are trying to
learn and recreate an ancient and honorable tradition that to pay some manufacturer
to make yet another piece of garbage that does nothing except turn a profit for
the company.  

Here I will plug some bladesmiths that I respect:  Shadowmaker, Atlantia;
Sylard of Eagleshaven, Ealdermere; Duncan, Trimaris.  A supplier of blades new
and used of various qualities that I respect is Ironmonger Jim, a
mundane who sells at sci-fi conventions and by mail.

And now I will close with one bit of advice: No matter what you are buying, buy
the best you can possibly afford.  It will last longer, work better,  and be more
beautiful than the cheap stuff.

yank 'em so fast their head would be spinning for the next millinium!

Subject: Re:  spun-top helms


	Duke Sir Inman has been making helms using these tops for about 
6 or 7 years.  His supplier has been in the business somewhat longer :-)
These are 14 gauge *after* production, as he wanted them to be legal in 
all kingdoms, and while they will take the occational dent, I've seen
them in use for years of fighting.  The one possible mitigating
circumstance is that Ansteorra does, as a rule, take their blows
lighter than other kingdoms  (this seems to be a north-south
difference to some extent, as Merridies also takes their blows lighter
than the East or the Middle, say.)

 
>As for hitting hard, one would hit hard enough that if the weapon were real, 
>it would be fatal.

	Incorrect, by the standards most kingdoms apply to gauging of
killing blows.  The marshall's handbook, in every kingdom I've seen,
says that a clean, unimpeded blow, delivered in a manner that would allow
for killing force (to rule out saber style wrist-flicks) is to be taken
as a killing blow.  Simply gauging blows by their force is not only 
inferior, but incorrect.  Not to mention that it leads to blow force
escalations that are both dangerous and make it impractical for some
of our people to compeate.  I don't know of any member of the chivalry
that would support your statement above.


>                     Lighter hits would be those experienced during slow or

	Consider; I'm only 5 3/4 feet tall, I weigh about 210.  I bench
(last time I benched) around 200, I military press 190.  I know how to
put both my strength and my weight behind my blows.  Now put a 3 pound
sword (or a 7-8 pound pole arm) in my hands.  Do you *want* me to swing
as hard as I can?  Then consider that I'm far from the strongest person
I know...  and that, (for example), Sir Hilary once decked Duke Paul
with a blow she thought felt light... 

	Full speed does not require full strength, and we are (as a group)
not attempting to recreate full power blows.  Anyone who does and weighs
more than 120 is overdoing it and is potentially dangerous.  

>So, kind Sir, swallow thy gorge and know that my missive was naught but
>concern that you did not buy play-armor.

	In fact, I still fight in my first helm, an experiment by
Baron Alemondus of the Steppes.  The crown piece (coming down to about my 
earlobes) is 10 gauge.  All the same, I know numerous fighters (besides
Duke Inman himself) who fight in those helms, I'm not that worried about
their use  (except in certain parts...  :-)

Lord Kale's suggestion is a limited form of an idea that i've been

of Cooper's Lake and give a chunk to each Crown.  The Crowns can
in turn hand bits of it off to their Barons, other bits to trusted
chivalry (is there any other kind?  :-) and so on.  All of the problems
that Lord Kale brings up occur in spades with this, of course, but it
is still very very period.  Think of the influence peddling, oaths
of fealty being *tested*, land wars, masters-at-arms camped all along
the borders in the marches between kingdoms...the mind boggles.

I didn't say anything about the idea being *workable*. :-)

Message-Id: <3246@tank.uchicago.edu>

Response to the recent posting by Kwellend-Njal

My current helm and its predecessor both had spun tops from
get-em-on-the-field, and I have had no problem with either. 

I do not think we should be routinely hitting as hard as we can. I do
think a helm should be safe against a strong man hitting as hard as he
can. There are too many situations when one has to hit hard in order to
hit fast.

Incidentally, I have fought in quite a lot of kingdoms. My impression is
that Meridies tends towards lighter weapons, and thus to some extent
lighter blows (varying among fighters and groups, however), than most
other kingdoms. Ansteorra seems to hit as hard as most others.

I am not sure of the current wording of the rules of the lists, but I am
pretty sure the original rules were that we were supposed to be
registering blows according to the effect they would have with real
weapons on real armor. To that extent the gentleman Kwellend-Njal is
corresponding with is correct. In practice, most fighters, and perhaps
most kingdoms, have tried to modify that rule to allow for "could have hit
hard enough to kill with a real weapon through real armor but chose not
to," thus reducing safety problems.

In response to various arguments:
On new members- In fact, my claim is that the Pennsic War, coronations,
and crown tournaments, together with a few other large, remarkable
events, are not very good events to take new people to. In addition, I
suggest that those unconnected with the SCA have no business there at
all. The responses I have seen so far (I am a day or two behind the rest
of you in reading the digests) mostly want to address the question of new
people. None of us, of course, have defined what we mean by the term. I
am speaking of people who have an interest in the SCA, have been to maybe
one event, and are still getting their gear together. These people *can*
go to large events happily and successfully. They are *most likely* to do
so if someone of more experience will advise them, help them get ready if
they need help, and find them every so often at the event to see how
they're getting along. If you are not actually going to do that
personally, you shouldn't encourage them to go.

His Grace cites an experience of Duke Vissivald's in having met a
gentleman in a game store whom he took to Pennsic on short notice and who
became a long-time Scajun. I would point out that the gentleman in
question seems already to have been interested in the Middle Ages (not an
outstanding characteristic of the young woman in my game store) and that
he was, according to his Grace, "carried off" to Pennsic *IV*. He was, if
I understand the example, taken to an event which, although large by the
standards of the time, was not monstrous, and taken there by an
experienced Scajun who, no doubt, took responsibility for him having a
pleasant time.

Etienne d'Argent wonders where I do want to take new people. Now every
group is different, they have different local activities, people join at
different times, and so forth. But in our local group we have weekly
fighting practices, weekly arts and business meetings (with dancing every
other week and presentations or group researches or everybody-bring-a-
medieval-book storytime on the non-dance weeks).  We give an event with a
tournament and feast in the fall and in the spring, and in early summer
we hold an outdoor regional fighting practice. We have someone from the
group going to at least one event a month, and they often have space for
riders. Our new people *do* talk. They also dance and fight and cook and
eat. And when they're not quite so new most of them are active, useful,
and (judging by how they keep coming) happy people playing SCA and
investigating the Middle Ages.

And all this without telling people we barely know that if they think
they might someday be interested in our great stick-fighting game they
should come to a big, sprawling event where they can wear the enormous
sword the SF convention organizers told them to take home, get drunk, get
naked, and get laid.

On membership- I am most interested in your suggestions on a different
way to sort Scajuns fron non-Scajuns, if we do not use paid membership. I
agree with His Grace that paying your membership does not guarantee that
you have contributed to the quality of the SCA. On the other hand, it is
a clear, easy way to sort people by interest. We are not in the habit of
paying SCA dues without question, although many of us unquestioningly pay
dues to other organizations, and we wish to rebel against the idea. If we
wish to sort our attendees at all (and I recognize that many of us don't)
how should we do it? Lord Thomas Lake suggests Pennsic by reservation
through seneschals, with a view towards guaranteeing that the attendees
are connected with the SCA. I could live with this sorting mechanism,
too, though it seems to me somewhat more subject to abuse than the
membership one. On the other hand, the paperwork would be unspeakable.

Other ideas?

Subject: Membership Fees, Poverty & the War

I'm afraid I have to take exception with Enid Aurelia's assumption
that requiring membership status for participation in SCA activities
(including the war) is not oppressive for low income SCA members.
(Afraid, because I'm very fond of Enid and don't like to agree with
her.)

I remember the desperate poverty of some SCA knights who nevertheless
managed to make it to the war during the period I was most active
(now 8 or 9 years ago).  They already had cars so getting to the
war was feasible: and on-going participation in SCA activities
that cost something in themselves seemed a preferable alternative
to paying the membership fees and foregoing the activity.

A lot of the folks active in Seashire have been unemployed and
the membership fee is burdensome for them.  They can hitch a ride
to the war with more affluent folk, but every expense is a burden
to them.

I also remember the Toronto branch of Septentria complaining bitterly
at the time when membership was first made a precondition for
a variety of things because of the impact of this policy on the
poorer members of the group, especially since we Canadians *must*
pay for first class delivery.

Allowing members to sponsor non-members doesn't address the problem:
suppose there are whole families of relatively poor non-members
who are active and creative SCAdians: are they to be divided
up among different members of the group for registration purposes
at
at Pennsic?  What if the different group members arrive at the
campsight at different times?

Also, the assumption seems to be that destructive and burdensome
people at the war are mainly non-members.  In fact, I suspect
that most of the drunken, noisy louts who are a burden
to other campers and participants are in fact members of
the society.  There is  no correelation between ability
to pay and/or prior connection with the society and courtesy
... unfortunately.

This business of people who are already "in" restructing those
who come along later and are "outs" only because of chronlogy
has always exasperated me ... whether it's a matter of SF
connections or the SCA.

(By the way: I apologize if some of this looks odd:

joke and as a play on her name and insisted that it is not period. Nonsense.
Majir is perfectly good Arabic and ties in with the "blatant" persona well.
Call me Majir, the translation is NOT good for little ears. People tend to
give up too easily or get discouraged too fast. No onus, just reality. It is
a nasty way to spend your time. Name books are often inaccurate, biased, and
of limited good. But they are available. So, use them and then go one step
beyond (is that cigarette smoke I'm smelling?). There are serious collections
of epitaph and memorial books available for most of Europe, North Africa,
the Levant, Asia Minor, China, and Japan. Not to mention the islands in
between. The main problem is that these gems are rarely in English. The
Inquisitions (note the plural) provide a significant amount of information
that the Inquisitors never expected. Enough wind, the following titles are
of books and microfilms I have found useful. Title translations are provided
for titles that may sound obscure (langs. incl. Russian, Polish, Hebrew,
Yiddish, Spanish, and Portuguese).

This will be strictly from memory, and so may not be exact in wording, but
it should be close.  (And I think it says something about the impact of
the wording, that I would remember it from that many years ago.  An Tir
sometimes uses this oath, but seems to use others more often.)

Here do I swear...by mouth and hand...fealty and service...to the Crown
and Kingdom of the West [or An Tir].  To come and to go...to strike and
to spare...to do and to let be...in such matters as concern the Society.
In peace and in war...in need and in plenty...in living and in dying.
Until the King depart from his throne...or death take me...or the World
end.  So say I, [name].

Re:  Memberships.

All this discussion about restricting activities to people who are
willing to fork over twenty bucks.  The SCA has never been a "pay as
you go" organization, at least never in my experience.  So why start
now?

For years I never had a membership, that has been a recent
activity, as I started fighting in Crown/Coronet Lists, and it was
required.  (I understand the requirement of Membership for
"officers", as a precaution to legal actions.  Although I never
understood why a fighter couldn't buy his membership after he won
Crown, not two months earlier.)

But membership to attend events?  Be real.  I thought the SCA was a
"non-profit educational organization".  How else do you educate
people if they can't go to events?  Or am I welcome as long as I
"wander in" in mundane attire?

Or are we trying to make a distinction between "local meetings"
where anyone is welcome (where Nicolla suggests you bring new
people) and "old buddy camping get togethers" where we make you pay
money to be part of "the gang".

I remember (years ago) when site fees were voluntary, i.e. a
donation, and if you couldn't afford it you didn't pay.  More and
more I've seen constables try and get fees from "mundanes" who just
wandered in, it doesn't start things off very well.  (I'm not trying
to blame the constables, as they were "following orders", but
pointing out the growing rigidity that seems to have developed over
the years).

I constantly run into new people who think they need a membership to
"play the game".  If we try and make that true, where do we draw the
line?  The current BoD ruling is that any event/meeting/practice
announced in a Kingdom newsletter is an "official" activity, do we
restrict all participation in "official activities" to members?  Or
only those events we want to reduce participation in?

Well, too much already, I'll start flaming if I keep this up.

Greetings!!

How ironic considering the recent thread that the
Ansteorran Crown Tournament held May 13 should
have a non-belted winner. Ld. Patrick Michael
Gordon squire to Duke Sir Hector Phillip Martel
defeated Duke Inman (of spun-top helm fame) in 
the finals of this 30-person crown list.
30 people is very large for one of our crowns and
is due to this reign being the 21st (i.e. beginning
our second decade) of the Kingdom's existence.
Many of the top guns participated, Patrick just
fought extremely well. While our Kingdom does
have a precedent of un-belted fighters sitting on
the throne, I personally believe Patrick will be
knighted before or at coronation because he has been
very close for a while (imho).

I am going to stretch your forebearance one more time and try to help with
the problem of costumes. Their are a number (a GREAT number) of excellent
monographs, books, and articles concerning historic/"primitive" costume.
Yes, even Russian/Baltic costumes. The problem is they are not in english.
The majority are in french, german, and russian (depending on area). People
tend to overlook journals of various societies (e.g. Royal Asiatic) or early
travelogues. This is understandable. Travelogues are idiosyncratic and
fairly recent (with some notable exceptions), what good are they? They
provide cultural context, usages of traditional items, historic and
antiquarian digressions, phylologies, references to other scholars work
etc. etc. Take the time and read the travelogues in your area of interest,
you will not be disappointed. Journals require the ability to wade through
indexes, but are also unbelievably rich in data. I will include some of the more
 interesting references concerning NEAR EASTERN costumes that I have come
across (I have well over 300). For the sake of most, I will leave out the
academic German, Arabic, Turkish, and Hebrew and concentrate on the English
and French (easy stuff - shouldn't be a problem).

I hope that this was useful. I feel a little guilty taking up room, but
everyone seemed to be tying themselves in a knot over costuming.... I

So should any research librarian worth their salt. Still, contact me if you have
 TRIED but can't find them. Next issue I will include Russian and Baltic sources
 but be forewarned, they are going to include Russian, Polish, German, Czeck,
Hungarian, Estonian, and Lithuanian sources (I will try to keep them as easy
as possible - there are some basic Russian and English sources). Translations
can be difficult and time consuming, still I found them useful. Try to find a
friendly local source. This should be possible in both the East and the West.
I know such sources are available in Midrealm. My time is limited due to
mundane obligations, but I will try to help -- a little. This really isn't my ar

Subject: Smoking (food, not that nasty habit)

To Svein,  who asked about smoking:  Remember, you asked for this.

My mother runs a fishing charter boat, and smokes fish.
Smoking (at least fish) dosent have much of a recipe to it, as far as I
can tell.  You put you fish fillets (skin on) in a brine of water,
salt, and molasses,  and let  it soak overnight,  then  drain, and smoke
it.  She also bakes it sometimes, in there somewhere.  Note please that
this is just a description, and not instructions on how to do it.

Our smoker is basically a 2 part thing, made out of two 30 gallon drums
side by side.  In one side you build the fire, in the other goes the
object of smoking.  A pipe, about 4 in. diameter connects the two for
the smoke to go through (the chimney is on the side the fish is on, so
the smoke wants to go there)  Apple wood works  quite nicely.

I also work in a cheese store, so I know a little (very little) about
cheese.  I dont think that  smoking it is at all  new.  Smoking was
originally done for preservation of food, not for flavor.  Today, its
for flavor, not preservation.  So, you shouldnt have any A-police down
on you for  smoking anything.  No guarantees on the Fire Department.

I remember  now the bit about baking fish.  If its a really fatty fish,
baking it ( i think before smoking )  will get a lot of the fat out, and
make your  fish much better.  Smoked fish should not, and does not have
to be  greasy.

Remember to always cut as much of the  belly fat  off of the fish as
possible,  thats  where those nasty pesticides, etc. tend to congregate.

Also, smaller is better in terms of fish.  Big  fish look nice.   Small
fish  taste  good.  Thats why we never scorn coho "jacks," they are
great to eat.  Lake trout smoke  very nicely.

Well, I think I've rambled on  enough.  I hope this helps.
If you want more info, find people who do it, thats  how my mother learned,
and now she does a  wonderful job of smoking stuff.

Yours in Serice  to the Dream,

Subject: Fighter training

I've seen a fair bit of comment lately on the "best" way to start
training new people in SCA combat, and I can't watch it any longer
without adding my two cents worth.

I like to start people absolutely unarmored - just the clothes they
show up in.  I do suggest they show up in sweats or something simiar
that will not restrict their movement.  I begin with stance and
movement drills - how to stand, how to move and remain balanced and
oriented to their opponent correctly.  Then I teach single sword -
broadsword only, in one hand.  Still no armor.  I use a very slow
set of exercises to teach how to swing a sword and how to block
with it.  Slow means at a speed slow enough that you can instantaneously
stop the blow at any point in the trajectory.  When a student has
a basic understanding of a simple forehand snap and a simple backhand,
I pair students up.  I place them standing out of range, so they
cannot hit each other even if they swing too fast and also miss their
block.  Then I run them through a set of kata, starting at the very
slow speed defined above, and moving up to about half speed.
After they have the hang of this, and a good bit of control (keep in mind
we've been through probably two practices now, more if they have
coordination and control problems) I start them doing the same kata
with movement.  Then we get them into armor.  I let them work with
single sword sparring at a slow speed in range, mostly working with
me at this point instead of each other.  Then I teach them about a
shield.

I'm slowly working out a written training course syllabus for this,
and someday will have it available for distribution.  It has worked
very well for the people that have followed me through the entire
program - not many, at this point, because they usually don't want
to take the time to learn the basics they really need, but go off
and spar.  There's lots I haven't mentioned above, such as teaching
off hand single sword first (if your stupid hand can manage to learn
a skill, your smart hand learns it really fast...).  I'll happily
correspond via email with anyone on training topics - one of my
favorite topics :-)

Pensic and membership
I agree in substance with much of what Mistress Niccola suggests
about Pennsic.   I have met outsiders there who had very little
idea what was going on, and they were planning to stay drunk,
stoned and otherwise sated for the rest of the week to make
sure nothing permeated.  (I'm NOT making this up.  I met them
as customer's in the merchant's barn.)
 
I believe Pennsic should be closed to members and persons
sponsored by members.  Each member could sponsor up to
two non-members IN ADVANCE.  Members could still come in
at the gate without pre-registration (late arrival carries its
own penalties, as well I know).  Non-members would have to
be pre-registered.  The sponsoring would make someone nominally
responsible/accountable for orienting the non-members.
 
I don't buy the statement that some people are so poor, that
they can afford to come to Pennsic, but they cannot afford a
membership.  No-one who is able to come to Pennsic is
unable to afford $6 US.  (In the days when I was a poor student,
I paid my membership and went to local events.  $25 was not
such a big deal-several hundred dollars to buy camping equipment,
pay for travel and all the other costs was right out)
 
The fees for members and non-members should differ dramatically.
This makes membership an incentive.  I would furthermore have
a deputy of the Society registrar AT THE GATE.  Memberships could
be bought at the gate, and downloaded to the California registry
every night.
I suspect that by Thursday of the big week, this service might
have to be discontinued, because of crowds, but I think it would
do very well in the days prior to that.
 
It answers some of the objections people have about barring non-
members, while making clear that this is a special event
(like Coronation and Crown Tourney, only more so ) and that it is
held particularly for members and friends of members.  Whoever
made the point about service clubs and their special events
had the right analogy.
 
Pennsic is not a public event.  Democracy does not mean that
everybody is allowed to go anywhere and do anything without
commitments or responsibility.  Democracy means that anyone
is ALLOWED TO TAKE ON COMMITMENTS (become a member) and to
be a part of our game, PROVIDED they follow the rules.
 
Finally, I do support taking newcomers to Pennsic.  I did
not have the opportunity, and today, many of our newcomers
can't afford it.  I always try to get them to a Coronation,
and have often been rewarded by shining eyes and a "Now I
understand what it's all about".  Pennsic puts it together
in an even more special way.  We all value it as a magical
experience.  We want to share the magic, and we also want
to preserve it.  I think my suggestions might go some way
towards helping.
 
Feel free to comment, but please don't flame.  This is
a "cool" medium, and it tends to distort words.

The individual can still request a court of chilvalry to be held on the
crown.

A banishment only lasts for a reign.

All things have some opportunity for misuse. The question is, as I see it, to
what extent do we need to regulate our affairs before it is too much effort
to learn all of the regulations let alone obey them.

The King in question was HRM Natan. Natan was eventually knighted by the
other finalist who was knighted next to, and directly succeded Laurelen I,
Alen Eligil I.  The comments I heard about Laurelin and Alen's knighting
were on the order of "Well, we _Were_ gonna do it a court tonight." and
"Yea, that's about right. They've been having hard practices for about 5
years now." Amazing what you remember when Crown is local!

This was also an odd time. Everyone kept expecting HRM Natan to be knighted,
but the way HRM of the East Girth Oldcastle's knighting at the war was
_preceived_ in the Middle put a lot of folks off the idea.

For the anthopoligists out there, there were about 35 knights, 30 Laurels,
and (I guess here) 20 Pelicans in the Middle Kingdom at that time (1978-9).
The Pale had a circulation of 600 with the "official" estimate of 1800
participants. This was back when the waivers were printed in newsletters
and the Middle expected serial numbers on them. (Guess who did the stamping?

Why not allow the SCA to accept reservations and then charge people
accordingly at the gate? A record of who has made reservations and how much
to charge them could be kept (one might even hide a daemon in the troll tent).
Presumably those with reservations would bring their confirmation and their
campsite allocation with them anyway, but the information would be best kept
on hand regardless.

The Cooper's would then be given their fee from what is collected and the
rest of the fee could go toward improving the War (maybe paying the Autocrat).

Subject: allegiance/residency
Message-Id: <3218@tank.uchicago.edu>

even to the extent of writing poetry against it ("The New Order," in the
Miscellany), and am happy to see less specific requirements for peerage. 
I am a little bothered, however, by the specificity of what is being
proposed. Consider the requirement to know chess, as applied to a saga
period Norseman, or a sixth century Briton. The former might know Hneftafl
and the latter Tawlbrydd, but neither is likely to know chess. The same
applies to dancing--my persona would not know any of the dances done in
the SCA, nor any other dances for which we have sources. One of the
problems with the merit badge approach, even in the current version, is
that it requires a persona from a specific time and place to have the
education of a generic medieval, as defined by the Society. 

Resident/subject/etc. Over the past twenty years, I have been a subject of
a kingdom different from the one I was living in for about three or four.
That includes the time when I was in the East scouting out the opposition
preparatory to declaring Pennsic on behalf of my Liege Lord Iriel of
Brannoch, King of the Middle. It also includes various occasions when I
did not want to be in allegiance to the current king of the kingdom I had
just moved into (or, in one occasion, had moved onto me), or did want to
stay in allegiance to the current king of the kingdom I had just moved out
of. 

My own feeling is that allegiance is a matter between a man and his lord,
and that neither residency nor the board of directors has anything to do
with it. If the king of kingdom A knights a resident of kingdom B when the
king and knights of Kingdom B are sure he is not qualified may be acting
foolishly, and provoking a certain amount of bad feeling across the
border--but, unfortunately, kings can be foolish in lots of ways. Kingdom
B may end up with a poorly qualified knight, but that could happen just as
easily if the knight was knighted in A and then moved to B--it is an
unavoidable probablem with our system. 

"And, popular right now is to require different weapons systems for the
first two rounds of the finals (which are best 2 out of 3), with the third
round being at the individual combatant's choice." (comment in a posting
about Trimaris). That sounds like the old MK system. One fighter picks
weapon system for one fight, one for the other,  each uses whatever he
likes for the third. Merowald's influence perhaps?

Subject: Re: Better Pennsic site
Message-Id: <4581@psuvax1.cs.psu.edu>


      The most gracious lady Awilda Halfdane comments upon the feasibility
of buying a new Pennsic site. . .


      A group of SCA members of many years, among them lawyers, real estate
people, contractors, etc etc etc., have informally conducted (and are still
conducting) a feasibility study to determine exactly how much such a venture
would cost, and what some of the possible stumbling blocks might be.

      I am not a member of this group, but have several companions who are.
Strictly by my own (possibly flawed) recollections, some of the general
conclusions I remember are:

     You need at least 1 acre of camping space, and one acre of parking
space, *minimum*, per 100 people camping.  This does *not* include space
for such amnenities as showers, bathrooms, gathering spaces (i.e., barn),
road space, etc.

     You need to plan for a realistic growth rate, which means that more land
than is presently required will be needed.

     A full-time caretaker, who is *not* in the SCA in any way, (with salary
of at least $20000/year, plus housing at the site) would be needed, plus
a War Staff of at least 3 people/1000 people attending the War, for the period
of the War.  At a *minimum*.

     *Some* of the costs:  heavy equipment, land improvement from the basic
unimproved lots (*very* expensive), wells, plumbing, sewer/septic, road
building.  And even unimproved lots are not cheap.

     Bottom line:  estimated investment of $750,000+            

     Bankers have been contacted for information regarding loans, and for
such a loan (presumably without available collateral worth more than the 
amount of the loan), any bank is going to loan only 1/4 of the total amount,
and that only upon proof that the other 3/4 has already been raised.  No
bank wants to be stuck owning a large rural campground.

     Collections/fees at the War are tricky.  How are you going to keep the
Coopers from finding out about this, and if they do find out, what do you  
think that revelation is going to do to their willingness to take care of
our problems?

     If the SCA as a whole owns the campground, who has final authority
there?  The BOD?  If the campground is set up as a seperate not-for-profit
legal entity (to avoid the first point), who sits on *its* Board of
Directors?


     I don't think that a SCA-owned War site is an impossibility, and it
has a lot of good points for it, but I felt that those who are interested
in such a concept should know some of the difficulties facing that
endeavor.  And these are but a few.

     Any such endeavor would have to undertaken over the long-term, and 
would represent a *huge* investment of time, research, and money.

     Any volunteers?   (a rhetorical question)

Subject:  One of own boys does good

Greetings!

This is an "I just gotta crow"-type posting.  One of our very own Trimarians,
who resided in several shires here (inclulding my own Barony) before moving to
Tokyo (GRRRRRRRRR! the swine!), has just published his own volume in the _Man
at Arms_ Series.

He is Lord Edward of Effingham, aka "EddyEffy" (one word), aka Shingen-sama,
mka Anthony J. Bryant.  The volume, to be in bookstores *soon*, is _The
Samurai_, and it's illustrated by Angus McBride.  And, it's *good*!

A bit more crowing:  an advance copy of the book was sent to the gentles to
whom it was dedicated, which is why I've already seen it.  They are Sir Tetsuo
and Mistress Kimineko Sakura, Founding Baron and Baroness An Crosaire.
Moreover, to honor them further, in one full-page color illustration (I forget
the page number) of 3 samurai, the big one in the forground wearing red armor
and tying a cloth around his head bears Sir Tetsuo's mon on his chest!

Not only do I think this is *really* neato-spiffy-keen, I'm *very* proud of
all of them!

So, run out and buy the book, okay?

Subject:  Peers and associates

Greetings!

Regarding the status of peers' associates (the squires, apprentices, and
protegees):  while there is no official recognition of their status, I have
been given to understand that some Kingdoms have protected the various
associates' belts.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong.

The individual who pointed out that being an associate is in no way a
prerequisite for the peerage was quite correct.  Nor, as was also noted, is
it in any way an official indication of a "peer-to-be."

What the relationship usually is, is one of teaching and fostering.  It is
largely a private relationship agreed upon and entered into freely by the
individuals involved.  It is meant to be of mutual benefit, that each may
gain from it and grow thereby.

Thus, while there is *usually* some common factor (such as similar areas of
interest), this is not *always* the case.  I think the *only* real common
denaminator is a desire to work together and learn from each other.

At least, such has been the case in those Kingdoms with which I have had
contact in some fashion.

1) Hi, Clif!  Where are you nowadays?

2) I don't know a whole lot about food handling, but one rule I do know:  Meat
left unrefrigerated for four hours or more should be disposed of.  SCA feasts
often have meat out that long, and it is then taken home by people, or given to
local shelters.  NO, NO, NO.

3) KNITTING! I am willing to correspond with people on this subject, and as I've
been researching the subject for a while, I think I know something about it.
First bit of advice, check out Richard Rutt's *A History of Hand Knitting*.
It is quite good, but does have some weaknesses, which are fairly trivial.
Stay away from Edgar Heinz Kiewe unless you know what you're doing, Kiewe
perpetuates much of the romantic myths, not historical facts.

4) Dealing with people who haven't done anything bad yet but you're afraid they
will.  *sigh*  I've dealt with this one in the past.  I have no effective
solution.  I spent a Pennsic running along behind him telling everybody he got
chummy with "Don't believe him! He's a scoundrel!"  Alas, I wasn't believed.
(He's very charming).  I won't detail the ensuing tragedies.  

 I think the best way to deal with something like this is to keep it personal.
Going up to such a person and saying, "If I catch you even looking at my kid
I'm going to break both your arms,"  is to my way of thinking an acceptable
solution.  And if he doesn't seem impressed, call out the men with no necks,
your personal friends, and have then take him off to someplace where nobody can
hear him scream and have THEM explain it to him.  I don't like dealing with
this kind of problem at an official level.  In fact, I don't like dealing with
this kind of problem at all, but I think to protect the SCA dealing with
undesirables has got to be kept on a informal basis so that the organization
can't be sued for anything. 

 The only time the organization should take
official notice of unpleasant goings on is when they interfere with the
functioning of the organization.  Commission of a crime on site is such a matter.
I've dealt with this one too: a newbie I escorted to an event unknown to me
smuggled a small quantity of an illegal substance across a national border.
When i found out about it I told him I refused to be party to the commission 
of a crime,and he should get rid of the substance, because I was not going to 
transport it BACK across the border.  I put the fear of the law into him and he 
complied.  Since I was able to handle this on a personal level, there was no need to
involve the powers that be, either mundane or SCA.

5)  What do you mean, 0% of us need real weapons?  Ignoring apocryphal tales,
numbers of us have been set upon footpads, or have been in fear of being set
upon by footpads.  

Several people I know personally have used their blades to defend themselves from
assault.  When 1 out of 4 Americans gets mugged, and when 9 out of 10 American
women are the victim of some kind of sexual crime, I want a working weapon.  I
know the police tell us we should cooperate with our assailants in order to
avoid arousing them to do worse than they had originally planned, but I refuse
to make it easy for criminals.  If I've got a fighting chance, I'll take it. A 
resolute show of resistance intimidates many would be criminals.  And some
things are worth fighting for, no matter what the risk.  My child is one of
them.

6) Thanks for the Corpora stuff, Cher.  Can somebody who's got access to a
printer run off all the stuff from the Rialto pertaining to the proposed
revisions and send it to the poeple who want to see it?

7) Could somebody who knows what documentation is supposed to be post a sample
documentation for the rest of us to look at?  I've just been elected MOAS of my
shire and I'd really like to know what I'm supposedly to be doing about it.
I'd also appreciate any commentary about what a "good" MOAS does.  The job here
doesn't have a whole lot of definition.  My predecessor has told me "All you
have to do is send in the quarterly reports."  I'd like to be  a little more
useful to my people than that.

        Now, I realize the smiley (and I have a smiley dictionary of hundreds)

"male-type people"?!?  I mean, are a majority of your male fre . . .
acquaintances brain damaged?  Now maybe I am atypical, but roughly half of the
really nice people I know are male.  Same for the really intelligent people.
In fact half of the people I like are male (OK, I have a weakness for ladies,
but when I consider with as little Bias as possible, its around half).
Similarly, half the people I don't like are male (Alright, I can't think of
anyone that I really don't like right now, but I am sure the proportion holds
to roughly half).  All of this is really remarkable because by sheerest
coincidence, HALF THE PEOPLE I KNOW ARE MALE TOO!!!


        (Sorry about that, its just that irrational sexism sort of bothers me
at times)

Now on to the real reason to post: again a reply to Cher sorted by topic:


NAMES:  I cannot really agree with you on this one.  Since there is no way
other than documentation (and there is a lot for many cultures) to determine
whether a name "might have been used" - I think the present system is the only
way that leaves any control at all - and I think that control is important.

CHANGES IN GROUP STATUS: Yeah, if a parent group loses a child group and can't
maintain numbers than the child group shouldn't be splitting, but if they want
to and the parent group can't get it together, there's a message there
somewhere.

BANISHMENT: 97% Agreement.  Only 2 things: first I just can't believe it will
be used that often but when it should it should have more sting than the
present wording allows.  Also, the Crown can still declare a _persona_ to be
persona non grata during their reign (pardon the pun) and not expel the actor.
This would be for theater-type reasons and be in good fun - although of course
like anything else the King has to be careful not to offend (unless he wants
to, but that's another story)

OTHER KINGDOM RESIDENCY:  Right on - You're a resident where you're a resident
unless you have some pressing reason (transience or serious _personal_
allegiance).

CROWN HOLDING OTHER OFFICES:  153.7 % Agreement.

PEERAGE QUALIFICATIONS: I like the list, the things on it are important: chess,
dance, combat, music, these are part and parcel of the high medieval court and
as the list says "including but not limited to" the "MBS" is not that serious a
problem: most people who are trying real hard to _earn_ a peerage don't get
them unless they in fact _have_ earned them.

FEALTY:  Fealty is incredibly personal and there should be as many oaths as
there are swearers.  If William's oath (just for example) is religious (As would
be appropriate to his persona . . . and mine in fact as well) that doesn't have
anything to do with anyone except me and the person I swear it to.  In fact
around here many times oaths are deemed to be so personal that I can't hear

Subject: Camping space

Good Gentles of the Rialto:

In Regard to the problems of poor apportioning of space at Pennsic, I offer
these mitigating views:
My campsite at Pennsic this past August was in a formerly untried spot, where
"noone ever camped."  As you have heard, several new areas were breached, and
we had fully intended to have ten gentles in the space we finally obtained. 
Our fore-guard had roped the area; and put up the requisite list of
participants.  We had a fairly small camp, with some common space under a
dining fly at the middle.  The day my lord and I arrived, we heard from our
four-guards that two tents would not be with us due to a death in the family. 
Hereupon I began to feel a little uncertain; would we be taking up too much
room?
(I had been trained in guilt from early childhood)
Then whichever god or saint who looks over campers at Pennsic took a coffee
break.  The water main which fed a faucet at the top of the hill (we were
camping on the side) broke.  Over the next week, we had the unenviable medival
experience of camping in  marshland.  A wide path (12 feet or more) was cut
through our camp, neatly taking up the space that had been reserved for Others
who were unable to come.

Now, while this may or may not have been an entertaining story, It raises
another issue:
When Pennsic is stuffed to the gills, what do we do if for some reason an area
of campsite becomes uninhabitable?
One crazed family of skunks.  Flooding problems, as described.  Fire.
The more people we cram into a space, the more dangerous it is.  Ask a
chirurgeon.  Ask a historian.

And as a side note (remember the childhood training) A site which looks like
it is a land-grabber may have other problems.

In service to the dream (and better water mains)

     Excuse my oversight, as I was thinking exclusively of "big weapons,"
swords, polearms and the like, when I wrote regarding Museum Replicas.

     Many of us have heard apocryphal stories about Sir so-and-so being
forced to defend himself against mundane ruffians with a sword, but I have
yet to hear one of these confirmed by the person involved.  Not to say that
it hasn't happened, but it's such a rare occurance, if at all, that I think 
my original point about 99 pip 99 percent of sword owners never needing to find 
out if their steel is "battle-ready" holds true.                           

     Of course smaller knives are a special case, and are much more likely
to be used for assault or defense, but even here, the steel 
quality issue (which is what I was addressing) really doesn't affect the
situation much.  One rarely blocks a knife thrust with another knife in 
street fighting.   Avoidance is much easier.

     Of course the same issue I tried to get across with live steel work
applies here as well.  If you haven't been formally trained in knife-fighting/
handling, bringing a deadly weapon into a situation where one previously didn't
exist (like drawing a knife in an assault situation where the offender doesn't
have one), is almost without exception A BAD MOVE.  If the attacker does know
how to properly use a knife, and you do not, you stand a very great chance of 
having that knife taken away from you, and you've thereby suddenly made the  
situation much more dangerous to life than it might have been.  Ask any law
enforcement official/martial arts instructor/self-defense councellor, and
they'll tell you the same thing. . .using a knife without training is about
as advisable as using a gun without training.

     Now there are always the situations where the attacker does not really
have serious intent, and is merely trying to harass, and in such cases a
knife can be a deterrent, _if the attacker is not truly intending to 
attack_.  In practice, it's very difficult to accurately judge whether 
any given situation falls into such a category.  What do you do if, upon your
pulling out your SCA dagger, your assailant says, "Ah, you want to play," and
pulls out one of his own, or perhaps a gun?  You've suddenly made the 
situation immediately life-threatening, where it may not have been before.
Or even if the assailant doesn't have any kind of weapon, and he gets yours 
away from you, he is much more likely to cause you serious harm than if no
weapons were involved.

     I'll cut this diatribe off now, since this is not clearly an SCA matter,
but since so many of us bear(sometimes bare) steel of one kind or another
from time to time, and because we, as a group, seem to place much more
stock on carrying knives than the general population, and because you
happened to hit one of my buttons, I wrote the above.  I've seen too many
people get needlessly hurt to keep quiet, and SCA folk sometimes seem to 
think that a basic familiarity with knives is equvalent to proficiency.
From a good deal of experience of various kinds, some of which was highly
unpleasant, I will give the advice any knowledgable person should give:  in
threatening situations, Rule #1 is: run away, as fast as you can;  get away
if at all possible.  Has nothing to do with courage--I probablt have a better
than average chance of surviving a hostile encounter, but I will follow the
First Rule if at all possible.  Rule #2:  if absolutely impossible to escape,
and you have *good reason* to fear for your life (i.e., the assailant says,
"I'm going to kill you," has a deadly weapon ready to use, etc.), fight as
long and hard as you are able, in order that you may surprise or damage your
assailant/assailants enough to follow Rule #1.  Rule #3:  do NOT escalate
the level of violence of a situation by introducing a weapon if no other
weapons are involved, UNLESS you are in the situation described in Rule #2.

     A good self-defense course is worth orders of magnitude more than 
a knife in the hands of an untrained wielder, and is much less likely to
get you injured or killed if you try to use it.  And SD courses work;  I
recently read a letter from someone I know through a SD course:  she was
attacked by five Arab men in Italy, who attempted to physically and sexually  
assault her in an alley.  Using the techniques she was taught, from an
initially prone position, she was able to severely injure three of the men, and
surprised/wounded the other two enough to flee and make it to a 
hospital, even though they had prviously broken her jaw.

    If you want to truly empower yourself to defend your person, enroll in a
good SD course.  I have all too many SCA comrades who place far too much
confidence in their untrained ability to defend themselves with knives, 
and I really hate to see friends putting their lives at risk.  The security
one gets from carrying a knife is a false and dangerous security if the
holder has not been trained to use it.

Wrong.  There is requirement for being a Squire--and, at least in the West,
it's the exception rather than the rule that it happens.

I know *far* more Knights--and Laurels and Pelicans--that did not serve
under someone first than that did.

Indeed, under the Corpora, there is no official standing for Squires,
Apprentices or Proteges.  The marks that are commonly used to indicate
such status are in no way reserved at the Society level and the titles
have no controls on them.  Any such arrangement amounts to a private
contract between individuals.

Don't make too much omelete out of the egg.  I think there is simple--
if rather mudane--explanation of what is going on here.

First off--I conjecture that there is a relatively constant fraction
of the general population that will have any interest *at* *all*
in the Society.  Growth rate will depend on how fast the word spreads
among our potential members, what the enclosed population is (ie. how
*many* of our kind of people are out there), and third--related to the
second and the first--the population density.  The 3 fastest growing 
Kingdoms happen to contain the 3 largest population centers in the US.
I don't think this is a coincidence.  I think it's directly related.

The 2 slow-growth areas--particulary Outlands--have low populations
that are widely dispersed.

What it all comes down to is the demographics of the population the
SCA is embedded in.  In a technical sense, this probably falls within
the sphere of interest of Duke Cariadoc.  Does your Grace have any
comment on my analysis?

Does anyone have any idea why the Nine of Diamonds would be called the

Subject:  Cher's thoughts on _Corpora_, the Universe, and Everything (LONG)

Greetings!

This will contain my commentary on the various proposed _Corpora_ clauses I
posted (taken almost entirely from my letter of comment to the BoD), plus
anything and everything else I have to say, as a mixed bag.  Since that _de
facto_ means a *long* posting, I intend to label every topic, so as to enable
readers to pick and choose.

>>>***DEEP BREATH***<<<

NAMES/NAMING PRACTICES:  As long as submitted names do not display a radical
departure from the culture and/or period they are intended to reflect, and are
not offensive, then I feel they should be permitted.  Regardless of
"propriety" (which is always a subjective thing, at best), what harm does a
"non-historical" name do?  None, so long as they are at least apparently
consistent with the period and culture they are supposedly drawn from.  And,
what can it hurt to make people happy by allowing them their chosen Society
names insofar as is possibly?  It seems to me to be highly desirable to do
just that.

It is true that, for a great many periods and cultures, considerable knowledge
exists as to naming structures and practices.  There are also many about which
little or nothing is known in this regard.  What seems to be largely absent
across the board is solid information as to what names tended to be common in
any given place/time, and/or to what extent people made names up.  So much
oral tradition has been lost, and so much written material as well, that there
is a great deal of sketchiness.  This is especially true with respect to the
common folk, who heavily depended on oral traditions.  Thus, even going by
available source material may be viewed as being no guarantee either way.  The
only thing one may be sure of, is that one cannot be completely sure!  Thus,
it has always annoyed me when a gentle's name would be bounced because they
couldn't demonstrate that the name actually was in use at a given time/place
(i.e., couldn't be found in print somewhere), even though the name was
consistent with the relevant naming practices.  All too often, one is
constrained by availibility of sources, whether or not any decent sources
exist, extent of source material, or any combination thereof. Thus, to me the
problem is not one of objectivity, but one of rigidity-- two different things.
In my opinion, the College of Arms has tended towards the latter with respect
to names, to the populace's detriment.

Whatever else the Society is or isn't, above all else it most definitely is a
hobby.  We do this for fun.  Yes, authenticity is important-- but as long as a
gentle's name conforms to whatever is known about the structural naming
practices in question, even if a unique combination of syllables, and/or
sounds close enough to be mistaken as "genuine," is it *really* worth all the
hassle? Personally, I think the heralds have better things to do...

CHANGES IN GROUP STATUS:  I largely support this clause as written.  It would
be wrong to leave a parent branch deficient in numbers, expecially
significantly so. However, I think that if a parent branch proves unable to
correct the membership level deficiencies within the grace period (length of
same to be at the Board's discretion), then the parent branch must face the
possibility of a "downgrade," unless the area requesting advancement chooses
to accept delay.  Such a situation would be unfortuate, it's true.  But the
resentment generated by forcing a Principality to forego Kingdom status (for
example) would be worse, in my opinion.  And, it's not like these things
happen overnight; changes in status generally take one to two years to
achieve.  If a parent group can't get their act together within that kind of
time frame, something's wrong.

And, in answer to whomever asked:  historically, it has been true that any
petition for advancement of a group's status has inevitably failed without the
approval of the Kingdom.  This does not, however, mean the issue couldn't be
pushed.  The petition could be sent directly to the Board.  It would, of
course, be impolitic to do so, and is therefore not to be recommended.

BANISHMENT:  Whereas I believe I understand the whys and wherefores behind the
phraseology used in this clause, the potential for grave problems remain.  An
excellent example of the sort of thing I am thinking of here, would be to
harken back to the problems here in Trimaris with a certain person later
expelled from the SCA.  The Crown at that time genuinely feared for the safety
of their young child as long as this individual was on a site; and I believe
they had good reason for doing so.

One could also harken back to the recent discussions here on the Rialto
regarding neglectful parents and problem children.  What about sites with
large bodies of open water, which untended children tend to be too-attracted
to (for example)?  Here again, sometimes the best way to deal with a recurring
problem is to prevent its presence to begin with.

If this clause is to stand as written, then any other existing options open to
Crowns and autocrats should also be outlined somewhere.  For example, if
autocrats can legitimately refuse to accept reservations from, and/or deny
admission to events to, individuals for cause, then that should be in writing
in _Corpora_ somewhere.  Frankly, I think we should be allowed the option of
protecting ourselves and those we are responsible for, should a genuine threat
be perceived.  Insofar as I know, there is absolutely no legal reason why we
can't do so.

And, in point of fact there are several excellent reasons for protecting
ourselves.  I am going to give an extreme example, but one which well-
illustrates what I mean.

Let's say that John Damnfool is caught with illegal substances on-site, here
in Trimaris.  Let's further say that, by whatever rationale, the authorities
are called in.  For any working Registered Nurse on-site (in Florida, at
least), there is a real potential that they will lose their license-- even if
they haven't the vaguest idea who John Damnfool is, or why the mundane
authorities are on-site.

Moreover, there are potential "ripple effects" which could involve the Crown,
Kingdom Officers, and the Corporation.

It should be remembered that while the SCA is a public organization, we are
still perfectly entitled to private gatherings.  This applies to events, which
as I understand it are interpreted as private.  Therefore, we don't have to
have anyone there who is a problem.  Moreover, most organizations with a legal
status similar to or like that of the SCA (including all the other ones whose
governing documents I've ever seen) include provisions for quickly getting rid
of people who are a problem.  A good example here are the various Civil War re
-enactment groups, which many of us are familiar with, if not involved in as
well as the SCA.  Think for a moment:  how well do the CW groups tolerate
assholes, and how quickly and efficiently do they get rid of them?

I and others have long held the opinion that the lack of such provisions in
the SCA's corporate structure have been a major weakness, and that the
resistance by the Board to the inclusion of such provisions an enhancement and
exacerbation of that weakness.

I am fully cognizant of the potential for abuses here.  But I feel that here,
as elsewhere, the option of something to act as the equivalent of a mundane
"temporary injunction" must needs exist.  Something to get rid of the problem
*now*, for all our sakes, with a permanent resolution (recension of the
banishment or expulsion from the Society, by the Board) to follow ASAP.

Out here, at least, banishment has always been considered to be an extrememly
serious matter, and one the Crown should not undertake lightly. Moreover "just
and stated cause" is required, and there are avenues for recourse and appeal.
The new phraseology removes much of the sting, and perceived purpose, from
banishment as it was viewed in this part of the Knowne Worlde.

The problem people *do not* always go away.  Nor can I agree with Sam'l de
Basset that such people are best left to "the outer darkness."  We are
entitled to protect ourselves and the Society by peaceable means.  I see no
reason the Populace in general and the Board in particular should be afraid to
provide means for doing do.

Btw, Sam'l-- you made one error:  only Crowns and Coronets can proclaim
banishment, and the latter must have the support of the former to do so.

On a related note:  I wish to express my feelings of warmth and thankfulness
at seeing such supportive postings as those by Cyrus, Li Kung Lo, and other
male-type people.  Apart from gladdening my heart, they remind me that Y-
chromosomes are not _ipso facto_ linked to brain damage!  :-)

OTHER-KINGDOM RESIDENCY:  I agree with both the substitution of the word
"resident" in the clause, with the option for an individual to remain the
resident of their parent Kingdom, at least in cases of transient residency
(please note that I am not necessarily of the opinion that the latter should
be encouraged)  Not only does this allow for what is already the occassional
practice (i.e., "Ambassadors"), and for what might be personal preference, it
might well make things easier for those in the military, college, etc..

It could also help avoid a number of potential bureaucratic problems.  I think
a good set of guidelines for making a decision are:  1) if one is in a
transient situation of any kind, one must make a choice for the time being; 2)
if one is permanently settled somewhere, then the Kingdom one resides in is
the Kingdom one is "subject to."  And while we each hold certain places dear
in our hearts, we must remember the famous saying about not being able to go
home again.

There is a gentle on the Rialto who has dealt with this dilemma in several
guises:  Baron Seamus.  So, Seamus-- why don't you tell us all what you think
the pros and cons are?  (There you go, Seamus; a hint which displays all the
tact and subtlety for which those who *really* know me deem me reknowned...
:-) )

COURTS OF INQUIRY/CORONET POWERS:  I see nothing wrong with this clause.
Any Coronet is certain to be working in conjunction with their Crown regarding
any matter so serious as to warrant a court of inquiry.  There's no harm in
having a little extra backup.  At worst, this clause errs on the side of
caution, and I can live with that.

CROWN HOLDING OTHER OFFICES:  I think this clause is long overdue, and very
much in the best interests of the administration of the Society (even if it
seems a statement of the obvious).  Since reigns are short, I can't agree that
this would impose a choice between Throne and Kingdom.  Deputies can take over
temporarily.  The thing is, one simply cannot manage to wear two hats
successfully at the Principality, Kingdom, or Corporate levels (with the
exception of combining Arts and Sciences as one); it's just too much work.

PEERAGE QUALIFICATIONS:  I am in favor of the idea of a more general
statement, such as that mentioned in the draft parenthetically.  Not only does
such a statement allow greater latitude in judging who is ready for the
peerage, I am _**very**_ much of the opinion that "merit badge syndrome"
should be discouraged and _needs_ to be discouraged.  I fear that "MBS" is a
serious and widespread problem at this time.

FEALTY:  I wish to remind all and sundry once again that oaths of fealty are
something to be handled carefully, lest mundane legal problems ensue.  This is
why I've always liked the _Lord of the Rings_ "oath."  If you stop and think
about it, it's not really an oath-- it's a *pledge*.  Sometimes, that's more
powerful.  Also, it sounds pretty, works well, and doesn't step on toes.

Another important aspect, to me at least, which no one has mentioned:  the
_Lord of the Rings_ pledge is eminently suited to the Society Peerage as it
actually exists and functions.  The Peerage are not landholding nobles in the
Society.  They form the heart of our leadership cadre, our role models, and
most of all they are our teachers.  The _Lord of the Rings_ pledge directly
addresses everything a good Society peer is supposed to be and do.

As to fealty traditions here in Trimaris:  both while we were part of
Meridies, and since becoming a Kingdom, the _LotR_ pledge was used 99% of the
time.  Usually, the Kingdom Officers were called as a group, with the same for
the Royal Peers, Landed Nobility, and the Peers.  Then came an open call for
anyone in the Populace who wanted to come forward.

More recently, the approach has been somewhat different.  This is due in no
small measure to some *serious* problems over the issue of fealty here in the
recent past (see my previous posting entitled "Some legal facts we should all
be made aware of" if you're curious).  All of the aforementioned groups, save
the Populace, are called forward in much the same way.  Then, pledges/oaths
are exchanged one-on-one with the Crown.  The Crowns have been tailoring their
words to fit each group, and each individual has a chance to reply in his/her
own fashion.  Each individual then receives a symbolic token from the Crown
(for example, the Pelicans might each receive a feather).  This has worked as
well as the _LotR_ pledge, if not better.  Personally, I hope this continues.

PENNSIC LOTTERY:  I've never been to the War.  The main reason has been the
overcrowding problem.  It's patently obvious, without ever having been there,
that the Cooper's facitlities are seriously over-stressed.  While I realize
the tradition and sentimentality involved, perhaps it is time to encourage
people to camp elsewhere as well as at Cooper's Lake.  I have been told many
times that there are very nice, very large, well-equipped campgrounds nearby.
Mayhap the overflow could go there, leaving Cooper's Lake to be centered on
the battlefields, contest areas, and merchanting.  I realize that this
wouldn't automatically solve the land-grab problem, but any and all
alternatives should be noted.

Also, I too can't understand why the Coopers mind early arrivals.   The SCA is
the paying public too, and a lot nicer to have around!  I am given to
understand that the Cooper's annual profits from Pennsic cover their operating
overhead *for the entire year*, although I have no way of knowing if this is
indeed true.  It's a sobering and interesting thought, nonetheless.  And, the
attitude seems to be changing.  Every year people come back from Pennsic with
ever more complaints amidst the war stories.  Last year's new complaint (in
addition to all the old ones) was that the Coopers were shutting off the water
altogether during the early evening and wee hours, making it all that much
more difficult to get a shower or cook.  Again, however, I wasn't there.

Seems to me it's high time we looked for a realistic alternative or two...

FOOD HANDLING IN THE SOCIETY:  Talking about Pennsic reminded me of this.  I
grew up in the restaurant business, and so know what's involved in handling
food in a manner so as to prevent food poisoning.  It's really very simple.
But, what's really very scary is the number of people who *don't* know how to
properly handle food-- and a lot of them will try to feastcrat, or cook for
large groups at the war, or work as a cook in one of the taverns.  Has anyone
ever thought twice about all the stories about "stomach flu" that come back
from Pennsic every year?  Ever occur to anyone that the symptoms of mild food
poisoning are identical?

More and more people are getting food poisoning, with varying degrees of
severity, at events.  Avoiding these problems is simple.  While I'll be glad
to answer questions for anyone who writes me, I strongly urge all and sundry
to do what we here in Trimaris are starting to do:  contact your Public Health
types, and find out what public service workshops or courses about food
handling are available, and what literature as well.  Find someone to go, and
then pass the info on through classes at collegia and Kingdom newsletters.
It's almost invariably going to be free.

Think about it, please-- before someone gets **really** ill!

TRIMARIS CROWN TOURNEY TRADITIONS:  These have naturally been influenced by
our parent Kingdom, Meridies.  This is also pretty much how we operated while
still a Principality.  Any gentle wishing to enter the lists at Crown Tourney
must submit a letter of intent, including proof of membership and of meeting
other requirements by Kingdom Law, to the Crown by whatever deadline the Crown
declares.  The Crown, of course, may reject any letter of intent. The Crown
also decides what weapons restrictions, if any, shall apply, and makes them
public in good time.  For example, there was one Coronet Tourney where only
great weapons were permitted.  And, popular right now is to require different
weapons systems for the first two rounds of the finals (which are best 2 out
of 3), with the third round being at the individual combatant's choice.

TRIMARIS PELICAN/PROTEGEE RELATIONSHIPS:  When Trimaris became a Kingdom, the
Pelican's Circle held a number of lengthy discussions on this topic.  We came
to several agreements, which we have held to and have worked well for us.

Any Companion of the Order wishing to take a given gentle as a protegee, tells
all the other Companions about it first.  This is so as to prevent
accidentally stepping on each others toes, to discourage "scalp collecting,"
and to give the Companion in question a chance to see what the rest of us
think.  This is *not* to say that anything negative happens:  one of the first
ground rules we established with respect to this topic was that any Pelican
has the right to any protegee, and none may gainsay them.

None of us wanted the yellow belts to be meaningless, and we all wanted to do
all we could to foster our protegees.  Moreover, we wanted to do our best to
enable the protegees to learn what being a peer is and means.  To these ends,
we took two major steps:  1) while every protegee "looks to" a specific
Pelican, *all* the protegees are protegees *of the Order as a whole,* and they
are free to consult any of us or all of us, and are actively encouraged to do
so; and 2) the Protegees join us in Circle.

This last has surprised a lot of people, but it has worked incredibly well for
us.  The Protegees are a part of the Pelican's Circle, and are free to speak
their minds and/or bring us their problems.  And, they do!  We include them as
much as possible, although they of course are dismissed when we are taking a
poll on a candidate.

When we first started doing this, we Pelicans weren't too sure if the
Protegees were getting anything out of it.  So, we asked them.  We were all, I
think, totally floored by the response!  The Protegees *unanimously* felt that
being a part of the Circle was beneficial, informative, and they *all* wanted
not only to stay, but if possible to have their role expanded!

In the long run, this has been so successful that the Laurels, as of the
Spring Coronation, have begun to include the Apprentices in their Circle!

TRIMARIAN ARTS/SCI JUDGING:  I'm very fond of our system-- but then, I helped
institute it! :-)  Numbers of entries per person per category are limited, to
prevent "flooding".  There are various other possible limitations, used as
applicable, the most general being that the item entered must have been
completed within the 12 months preceeding (NOTE:  there is a special "Long
Term Projects" category for those which cannot be completed within 12 months.

Each entry is coded by category and number.  As far as the judges are
concerned, each entry is therefore anonymous.

Each entry is judged on a scale of 0-100 points broken up across a variety of
criteria, such as materials used, originality, appearance, documentation,
etc..  The point scale is weighted towards documentation and effort, the idea
being that looking good isn't necessarily as important as making the attempt,
good research, and learning something.

Awards are made on the basis of the individual entries' scores.  For example,
a score of 96-100 (if I remember correctly) gets an award of "Extraordinary
Merit."  One can receive potentially receive as many awards as one had
entries.  One is therefore competing only against oneself.

There are also "Best of Show" type awards, one each for Arts and Sciences, and
awards for the top scoring individuals in each ("Paramount of the Arts/
Sciences"), and one may not (if I remember correctly) take it twice in a row.
The top scoring groups gets asked to autocrat the next Arts/Sciences Faire.
Thankfully, they may decline.

UNBELTED SOVEREIGNS:  Taking Principality and Kingdom status together,
Trimaris has had quite a few.  So, to us it's no big deal.  We like to think
that any fighter has at least a shot at winning.

LENGTHY POSTINGS:  Obviously, they don't bother *me!*  :-)  Seriously, though,
communication is too important a key to be limited.  I would rather go away
knowing everyone could feel that they had their say, even if it means
tolerating the smell of dead horse.  It's worth it.

To anyone and everyone who was masochistic enough to read this in its
entirety:  my gratitude.  Are yours eye still functioning at this point? :-)

Two things:

First, I thought I had made this clear, but I'd better repeat it. The current
Rolls Ethereal were compiled five *weeks* ago; various snafus prevented them
from getting to the Net before this week. People who sent their information
more recently than April 1 aren't likely to see that information reflected
in the Rolls. Sorry, but that's the realities of producing the thing; it takes
a lot of time to get it organized and printed out, and there was no way for
me to update it before it went out. The recent information will be in the
next edition.

Second, I suspect that people have been trying to get through to me, and
having trouble. My Internet feed seems to have gone belly-up this week; those
trying to get through might try my UUCP address, listed below in my

Message-ID:  <8905122051.aa13484@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>


Actually, I have heard of several kings named Michael called "Black Michael".  I
have even heard one person go so far as to say that no king named Michael has
ever been a good king.  I wouldn't go so far myself as I haven't met all the
kings named Michael, in fact, I haven't met any of them, but I can tell you the
story I think you're referring to.  This was before my time, and I can't vouch
for its accuracy, but source is generally reliable, so I think this is at least
a reasonable approximation of the truth.

  Michael the Abomnible, also called
Michael the Unmentionable, and the Michael whom Duke Finvarr's History of the
Midrealm Kings says only, "About him, the less said the better."  Michael was a
newbie and a stickjock who hadn't been in the SCA very long when he won Crown
Tourney in the Middle.  (Which is why Crown Tourney in the Middle is now by
invitation only.)  Michael picked a consort who knew even less about the SCA
than he did.  He annoyed an awful lot of people by being not a king, but a
tyrant.  But what he did that really steamed people is he stole the royal
regalia of the Midrealm and pawned it, and they had to sue him to get it back.
Michael then abdicated and ran far away very fast, and hasn't been heard from
since.

Normally I don't care to mention names, but this is ancient history, and I KNOW
that if I've got it wrong I will be corrected.  In fact, I'd appreciate it.

As for other kings called "Black",  Well, those peers are still around. And
I've only heard one side of the story, so I will say nothing about it, but
there does appear to be some legitimite gripe, and I hope what I heard
isn't true.

Yes, folks, I know it isn't very pleasant, but the SCA isn't perfect and I
think we have to talk about our mistakes and not pretend to new people that ALL
of us are uniformly noble and superior human beings.

I don't know if Michael the Ineffable was banished or not, I think he went
voluntarily into exile.  This is just about the only situation I can think of
as justifying SCA justice.  Michael did something that harmed the SCA, but was
not a really serious mundane offense,  He damaged the ability of the SCA to
function, so the SCA had to take steps to correct it.  They chose to do so
through mundane legal authority, which is fine with me.

Actually, this isn't exactly what we've been talking about, but it reminds me
of Corwin Corwinsbane.  

Corwin was in the semi-finals of Crown Tourney of the Midrealm when he went up 
againt the doughty fighter, Tonk A'Toi (Say it out loud.  Heralds hate his name:-)  
Corwin threw the blow that flies around behind the person and hits them from behind 
even though the  fighters are standing face to face.  Unfortunately, Tonk slipped 
and fell.  The blow whistled past over his head and caught Corwin right across the  
eyes.  A moment of stunned silence fell as Corwin realized what he'd just done.  
And then, to his great honour, he fell dead.  The populace cried "Hoobah!"  
And Corwin Corwinsbane became the only man in history to ever kill himself in a 
Crown Tourney.  You will be happy to know that this worthy later became king and 
ruled well.  I think he's also been knighted.

And speaking of legends, I'd like to hear Cariadoc's version of how the Pennsic
War got started.

Message-ID:  <8905122151.aa14188@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>


There are well equipped campground that provide many amenities for large
numbers of people, up to and including private air conditioned cabins.  There's
such a campgroudn I'm tole, in north central Maryland not too far from where I
live.  I've been told it costs twenty dollars a night.  It has a swimming pool
and other desirable luxuries.  persoanlly, I don't really want to pay twenty
dollars a night (but if it was held thirty minutes from my home I could
commute!)  Now if people REALLY want to move Pennsic, I'll call them up and
find out more info.  This site would be about five  hours east of the current
site.  I'm sure that something similar to it must exist close to Pittsburgh.
Such places are often called "conference centers".  

Moving Pennsic does have one advantage:  It means that the Barony Marche of the
Debatable Lands is no longer the principal bearer of Pennsic work due to their
proximity.  Rotating the War through different sites does give the opportunity
for different groups to provide the manpower needed to do it.  

As for the notion of buying our own campground, let me aquaint people with a
few realities.  I have done a little bit of checking on this subject.  My info
is about Maryland, but what I've checked into in Pennsylvania is effectively
the same.  Basically this, in large lots, land with woods and other pleasant
features goes for about eight thousand dollars and acre.  I don't know how big
Coopers Lake is, I estimate it about three hundred acres.  Then their is the
matter of installing plumbing, which is about about ten doallars per swuare
foot of land to be provided with water (Very rough estimate.  Lots of factors
influence it.)  Please note that land with things like running water is more
expensive, and land with running water is also subject to more meddlinga nd
restrictions by the government.  Basically, you have to guarentee that your
sewage disposal is not going to contaminate the water.  Drilling a well is
about fifteen hundred dollars minimum.  A well will serve a family of fours
normal needs, depending on the water table.  It may be necessary to dig a
deeper well at greater expense to assure a reliable water supply during hot
weather, or else to install some kind of back up system.  

At this point I stopped looking.  It is perfectly possible for the SCA to do
something like this, but I don't think the SCA is ready to undertake the
challenge.  We've got a lot at Coopers Lake, we can continue improving it.
I've been going ever since Pennsic Eight.  And we keep thinking we can't pack
anymore people in, but we do.  I can't begin to describe the changes that have
taken place in the way the camping is laid out.  I am amused at the people who
cry "We'll have to camp on the battlefield and fight between the tents!"  Well,
guys, you're already doing it.  Runestone Field is short for Runestone
Battlefield. When ever I pass it by I remember the hazy day little Sean stood
piping with the lake at his back while the champions battled it out before him,
and there wasn't a thing to be seen except the warriors and the piper and the
wilderness.

Pennsic is a fine method of introducing people to the SCA.  I call it the "sink
or swim method".  If a person is going to like SCA, Pennsic will hook him.  And
is a person doesn't like Pennsic, well, they won't like SCA either.  I've seen
a lot of people sorted out in this way.  I can think of half a dozen people who
decided they didn't like SCA after Pennsic but I KNEW they weren't SCA material
before they went, but they insisted on going. I did my darnedest to help them
make it, but  some people just don't get it what it's all about. Argh!  You do 
not borrow a stranger's short sword to cut the watermelon with!  Not without 
telling him what you plan to do with it first!

Hmm, gentles who are discussing whether or not it is safe to give sheild work
to an unarmored person, I think you need to clarify exactly what it is you
mean.

In our local area, and indeed in the larger area where I used to come from,
"unarmed" meant the person was wearing a helm and shield only, no body armor.
To me this is a perfectly safe way for doing slow work with new people, it
is the method being used to train my lord husband. So far the only person
who has ever been injured by this method is the trainer who said, "Don't worry
about me, I can protect myself!" So the newbie did as he was told and hit him.

Message-Id: <251@clif.UUCP>


Greetings, Gentles.

As a part time SCA-bum, and non-fighter, I'd like to comment a bit on
my (very) brief introduction to SCA combat.

The local group imported a knight from a neighboring group, who came
equipped with a couple swords, and a loaner shield and helm.  We
neophytes were given rudimentary instructions on shield use, and
then encased in the helmet while the knight slowly and gently beat
upon us with his sword.

The only armor we used was the shield and helmet, which might have 
been a bit too much.  In my case, it meant doing without my glasses,
so I could barely see the sword to begin with, and once I failed to
block a head blow, the not-fitted-to-my-head helmet rotated a few degrees
and I recieved a few more blows while I tried to listen for where the
blow was coming from.  (Thus, I learned that a helmet blocks hearing as
well as sight.)

I'm afraid I haven't been on either end of a rattan sword since.  (I've
taken up fencing, since I can fit my glasses inside a fencing mask.)

I recall with some pleasure a previous introduction to SCA fighting when
a squire and I stepped through some slow motion Great-Sword kata's, 
neither of us wearing armor.  I could see the sword, and being a simple
choreography, I could block effectively.

Now, if the idea of training is to discourage the less dedicated, then
I'd say put all the armor on them first thing.  Let them try to fight
half blind and encumbered.  If the object is to gain more experienced
fighters, then start the fighting with no armor, and choreographed
katas until they are ready to spar.  (I know, most would-be fighters
think they are ready to spar in about 15 seconds.  I leave the solution
of that problem as an exercise for the reader.)

Someday I hope to get to Pennsic.  I think it's wonderful that the
Society is able to field a force large enough to be as large as
some real period battles would have been.  It finally affords us
a chance to *really* play with tactics on a realistic scale.

It also presents the problem of Logistics on the same scale.  The 
logistics problem *can* be solved--do we have any ex-military
who worked on that end of things--or do we wing it?

>3) Nobody wants to autocrat an event with 10,000 people at it. 

I suggest that at this scale, the Autocrat become spure administrator
and that--if there isn't already--a staff system put in place.  If a
WolrdCon of 10,000 people can be run (and it has been done) by amateurs,
it should be possible to do the same with Pennsic.

The difference in founding ages probably doesn't make that much difference.
While the East now has significantly more people than the West now (though 
interestingly enough, the West has nearly 3 times--some 230 to 80, roughly--
foreign members than the East), that has not always been so.  I think
on a time weighted average, the West probalby has more longer-term people.
Also recall that Atenveldt, Caid, and An Tir fissioned off from the
West quite some time ago and that now the West (exclusive of Lochac and
Oertha--both of which, though large, are sparsely populated) is one of the
physically smaller Kingdoms.

I'm glad it's worked, but it would make me more tahn a little nervous
if it were tried here.  What are considered valid reasons for a King
to bar a given Knight from the Lists?  I'm a little confused on what
would cause a system to be set in place--within the Society--that
permits the King to have any control over who his successor might be.

[On apprentices.]


apprentices aren't done much in the West and there is no formal recognition
done that I'm aware of.  Nobody that I know of among the Laurels and
Pelicans has any apprentices, although the obligation to teach is taken
seriously.  Squires are more common--and somewhat more formal--than they
used to be.  Even there, there isn't a whole lot of wearing colored
belts--but again--it's becoming more common than in times past.

     Well, I got a sneaky Mongol trick for you spearfolk out there, developed
at the last Pennsic War.

     *Spear and shield*.  No, I'm not talking about one-handed spears, either.
It can be made to work, but it takes a special shield adaptation, and a lot
of practice.  If anybody is interested enough to send email, I'll send you

     Summary:  M.R. blades look pretty, and are in general well-made, but I
personally do not trust the steel.

     My 2c worth, from my personal experience.  You'll hear a lot of debate,
about whose steel is good, whose blades are truly "battle-ready," etc., but
really, for the majority of people who buy swords, it doesn't really matter,
does it?  All the sword *really* has to do is look pretty,  and avoid 
whacking goblets and other gentles at feasts.

     Now there are those folks who occasionally actually *use* their steel,
and for those, again from personal experience, I say, buy (at least) one 
nice blade for show, as pretty as you like, and go bang on a piece of flat
iron, or a jeep spring or something, until you have a workable piece for
live steel work.  Steel (raw form) is cheap.  Finished blades are expensive,
and if you go hacking away with 'em, all you'll do is put nicks and dents
in your nice court blade.  Now, I AM NOT advocating live steel work of any
kind for those who don't have the proper backround and experience with it,
or someone with that backround to teach 'em.  Without training (and SCA rattan
fighting DOES NOT count as "training" in this context!), the most you want to
be doing with your blade is cutting watermellons and plastic soda bottles and
such, and *that* only in a manner keeping safety foremost (i.e., in your own
backyard, with friends, stone cold sober, NOT at an official SCA event, with 
mundanes about, etc.).

     That said, I have to mention that I have had several friends have bad  
experiences lately with Museum Replica blades.  One of them was using one of
their Viking longswords (I can't find my catalog, so I don't know the exact 
name they call that particular blade--anyway, the one with the incised pommel)
to cut through a hanging simulated human torso target (water/gelatin filled
sack), and had the blade bend at a 30 degree angle from true.  This blade had
not been heavily used previously, or abused in any way.  He had a real trial
getting it replaced, and eventually had to wait several months for them to
"get one in stock," after they finally agreed to replace it.  Then they gave
him a hassle over his wish *not* to order an additional scabbard with the 
replacement blade (at his cost), since he already had one for the first blade.

     Anyhow, rather then go on at great length, my general impression is that
when Museum Replicas was handling only a few items (the Viking sword, 
Crusader lozenge-pommel, etc), all of their merchandise was of the highest
quality, and it was very reasonably priced.  Now, they have a great many 
items in their catalog, do a great deal more business than they used to,
and it seems that the general level of quality has gone down.  From examining
those blades which my friends have bought, I find that the steel quality 
varies wildly.  I've seen really good stuff, truly "battle-ready," were one
to wish to ding up one's nice blade, and I've seen a few really abysmal       
pieces of steel.  I tend to be distrustful of Phillipine steel as a general
rule, and I believe a good proportion of their stuff is made there now.
 
    The important point to make here is, as I said before, most folks do not
*need* a "battle-ready" blade.  Sure, it's nice to think, "if I really *had*
to use it, this hunk of steel at my side would do the job," but how many
people actually have to put their blades to the test?  About, well, "zero"
percent, or darn close to it.
     So by this criterion, the blades M.R. puts out are just dandy.  They're
really sharp-looking (no pun intended), and for the most part (with the obvious
exceptions like the "Conan" blade, etc.) are historically accurate.  I plan to
buy a few of their polearms one of these days, because I think they look 
really nice.  Q: Would they *work*?  A:  At least once, anyhow.
     However, if you *have* to have a truly "battle-ready" blade, I would
recommend caution when buying M.R. steel.  My experiences do not constitute
a representative sample of their work, and I may have just run into a few
bad examples, but you never know.  
     As I said above, if you want to do live-steel work, and are qualified to
do so, your best bet is forging out something useful and serviceable, and
*cheap*, and banging that up until it's time to make a new one.  Unless you
can afford to keep replacing $200+ swords.

I think it's mostly luck, plus a change in standards over time.  At the
first tourney--I've read the fanzine article, I wasn't there--it was
sort of decided that all of the gentleman were Knights.  During the
first year there was one King who came to one event and has never
been back (William the Silent).  Fortunately, all of the early fighters
seem to have been True Believers in the ideals we have come to know
and love.  Since then, the desired qualities have been layed out in
a more formal fashion.  I suspect that much of what we value in the
Society has a lot to do with the character of the people that were
there in the first year or two.  After the first five years or so,
(in the West, at least) it has become effectively impossible for anyone
who hasn't been around for some time to come anywhere close to winning
the Crown, and by the time they fight that well they have been 
sufficiently exposed to the ideals to have internalized them enough
to be *doing* what is right (by our lights) or they have left altogether.
Thus, the system becomes self-regulating and self-perpetuating, and
we don't have Kings who aren't already belted.  Since no dates were given--
consider: When was the *last* time your kingdom had an unbelted King?

Greetings to the Rialto and all who read this missive...

   I read in a posting a few numbers back, that people wanted potable water 
for drinking at Pennsic.  Has anybody thought about contacting the Pennsyl-
vania National Guard about supplying a few "water buffalos" for the main week 
of the War?  These things hold 500 gallons of water and most National Guard 
units have them available.  Not only would this cut down on contaminated water
consumption and the subsequent "plague" that goes with it, but The National
Guard (at least in the Midlands (Indiana to you and me)) most of the needs 
good public relations stories and they need to keep up a good rapport with 
the general public.  So what if this "general public" beats up on each other 
with sticks in the HOT August sun?  That would leave the fauceted water that is
near the campsites for cooking and dishes (since most people ignore the warnings not to dump dishwater near the spigots) (I also say cooking since a high enough tempture will kill almost anything that could live in water, but of course you all knew that).  Who knows, maybe the Debatable Lands will end up with some new people in the process?  We're all for Society growth, eh what?

	Another subject that has come up in the past is A&S competitions.
I feel very intimidated about entering one since a) I haven't been in the    
Society long (just over 3 years) and b) I haven't really found anyone in the 
Middle Kingdom who is interested in my area (knitting).  I have been to an A&S 
Collegium in Wurm Wald, but I found no real help in the area that I (and most
new people) need help in: Documentation.  The Judges scream for it and I haven't the foggiest notion what they want.   Being from a minute canton in the Midlands creates a problem, since most of our group lives elsewhere during the summer 
(aren't college groups just so much fun?).  Our A&S minister doesn't really knowabout documentation either, since his major area is music.  Enough bellyaching ffor now on that subject.

	One more thing that I would like to say;  I haven't been in very long
but my lord has and he not quite often enough for me tells me tales about the 
old days of the society (he remembers when Rivenstar was an incipient shire and when Duke Master Moonwulf was just getting ready to authorize as a fighter.)
I would like to hear any and all histories of the Society and specifically the 
Middle Kingdom.  I'm sure that others new to the net and the Socitey would like to hear them too.  

Well, nuff said, I need to get back to work.  
Thanks for letting me bend a few ears.

My lord Hal,

You suggest a number of rather good ideas for controlling attendaqnce
and land-use at Pennsic War.  Unfortunately, there are certain
practicalities which make them mostly unworkable.

The War is run at Cooper's Lake campground, and all fees are collected
by the Coopers.  They will not agree to any other system: They collect
the full camping fee at the gate as you arrive.  In the past, they
have been unwilling to consider any form of advance payment.  Thus,
any form of advance registration is currently out of the question.
One idea which has been floating around for a while has involved
having the SCA run reservations, and give each registeree a ticket
good on or after a certain date.  This may be the wave of the future,
but up to now, the Coopers have been adamant.

Another proposal on the table fo several years has been the
establishment of a permanent inter-Kingdom Pennsic Council, which
could give some continuity from year to year.

	Arval.

For the last couple of days, I've seen postings talking about a "heraldry"

want the program to do!  I don't know what's involved, but I really don't
think it would be all that tough to construct a HyperCard Stack for the
Macintosh that displays or lets you create or view heraldry or armor.

Also, I was given a book for my birthday called something like "A Pictoral
History of Medieval Weaponry". It's about 200 pages long and loaded with
pictures of armor, pikes, swords, sheilds, catapults, battering rams, axes
helmets, dirks and daggers, and it even has a section on horse armor!
All the pictures are very "scannable".

The upshot is, is there really a market for something like this?  If so, I
wouldn't mind developing the stackware (as long as I knew what it was
everyone wanted to do with it!)

Subject: Unbelted kings, knighthood, population growth, etc.
Message-Id: <3198@tank.uchicago.edu>

A couple of brief comments, mostly on postings by Hal Ravn. He writes:
"I'm glad it's worked, but it would make me more tahn a little nervous if
it were tried here.  What are considered valid reasons for a King to bar a
given Knight from the Lists?  I'm a little confused on what would cause a
system to be set in place--within the Society--that permits the King to
have any control over who his successor might be."
So far as I know, the rules of the lists have always specified that
entrants must be acceptable to the Crown or its representative. In all the
kingdoms I am familiar with, the King has the power to bar anyone from the
lists. I suspect that is true of the West as well, although it may be
against custom for him to exercise that power. What is unusual about the
Middle is that unbelted fighters are permitted in the list only if
specifically chosen by the King, with the result that most unbelted
fighters are not allowed to fight for the Crown.
In explaining why nobody unfit for knighthood ever wins the crown, he
writes:
"After the first five years or so, (in the West, at least) it has become
effectively impossible for anyone who hasn't been around for some time to
come anywhere close to winning the Crown,"
I believe Paul of Bellatrix won his first crown within a year or two of
joining the Society, and that was long after A.S.V. I thought the same was
true of Radnor, but may well be mistaken. My general impression is that,
while the West may still be marginally better (at the top levels) than
other kingdoms, the difference is not large. I think the most recent
Eastern unbelted King was within the last few years.
In discussing population growth, Hal writes:
"The 3 fastest growing Kingdoms happen to contain the 3 largest population
centers in the US. I don't think this is a coincidence."

There are two problems with the argument. First, New York and Chicago are
among the oldest parts of their respective kingdoms, so you would expect
them to be responsible for size, not growth rate. And in fact, the Chicago
area is not a very large part of the Middle Kingdom population--three
small groups and one medium sized one. My impression is that New York is
bigger, but again not a major part of its kingdom's population.

Hal is of course correct in saying that part of what is happening is the
recruiting of that fraction of the population that fits into the Society.
That phenomenon would give a steep growth rate for a while, levelling off
as you run out of unrecruited potential recruits. Along similar lines,
Mark Twain, observing the rapid growth of the Christian Science Movement
in the late nineteenth century, predicted that by the 1920's they would
have control of Congress.

But I think the SCA, at about .01% of the U.S.+Canadian population, is
still very far from the flat part of the curve. So growth rates may depend
more on the culture of the local SCA group--to what extent people are
having fun and thus make it seem worth joining, how friendly the group is
to newcomers, and how much effort it makes to get publicity and recruit.

There have been two postings on the question of kings making knights. The
SCA pattern is based, I believe, on the modern English pattern, not on any
medieval model. During the "age of knighthood," the king had no particular
control over who was a knight, and knights did not normally owe allegiance
to the king.

Subject:  The _Corpora_ clauses (a tad long)

Greetings!

Below I have listed those clauses from the new _Corpora_ draft which the BoD
requested member input regarding.  Everything which appears below was in the
drafts which were mailed out on request; I have typed them verbatim except for
minor deletions of referrals to other clause numbers, which would be
meaningless.  This includes any bracketed statements as well.  I have
included the numbers of the clauses for reference purposes, in case one cares
to obtain and read the entire draft.

My own comments, along with anything else I have to say (what else is new?
:-), will be posted separately.

PLEASE NOTE AND REMEMBER:  If you want your opinion to count, don't just post
it-- send hard copy of *some* kind to *both* the BoD (_via_ the Corporate
Secretary) and the Steward.  The deadline is July 11.  Discussion here is as
it should be, but will not be considered by the Board if they haven't received
hard copy through channels.

                    THE RELEVANT _CORPORA_ CLAUSES


NAMING PRACTICES-- IV.C.3.a:  (NOTE:  this is the last sentence, from the
clause on Heraldic Administration. Only this sentence was singled out, in this
instance)  "Names compatible with the period ambience of the Society may be
registered even though they were derived from literature or invented for use
in the Society. [Note-- the last concept was introduced by the Board in 1987,
to implement its perception that the heraldic rules ought to be required to
include some leeway for inoffensive non-historical names.  The current Board
would consider removing it, if there is a general feeling among the membership
that the matter ought to be left to Laurel and the College of Arms.  Your
comment on this is specifically invited.]"

CHANGES IN GROUP STATUS-- V.D.3:  "To consider and approve an application for
advancement of a branch within the Society independent of how such advancement
may affect the status of the parent branch.  Specifically, the Board may
approve an advancement if the parent branch is left slightly deficient in
requirements for a branch of its status, and may at the Board's discretion
give the parent branch a 'grace period' t o correct any such deficiency.
[From G&PD #18.  The Board requests comment on the idea of dropping this
provision.  Variances could be granted pursuant to ...(references to other
clauses deleted)...and it may be desirable to avoid the appearance of
encouraging status changes detrimental to the parent branch.]"

BANISHMENT-- VI.A.d.3.c:  "Banishing subjects of the realm and visitors
thereto, for just and stated cause.  Such banishment has the effect of
withholding recognition of the person's honors and titles, and of barring that
person's active participation in Society events in that kingdom for the
duration of the banishment or the reign, whichever is lessr.  It specifically
does not preclude attendance at events, as long as the affected subject makes
no effort to engage in activities subject to the jurisdiction of any officer,
or to otherwise disrupt the peace of the event.  Banishment runs from the
moment of proclamation, but a notice must be published in the next available
issue of the kingdom newsletter if the banishment is to remain in effect.  In
addition, the Steward and the Board ombudsman for the kingdom must be notified
as soon as possible after the event at which the banishment occurs. [Based on
G&PD #23]."

OTHER-KINGDOM RESIDENCY--  VI.A.1.e.1:  "Awards.  Under no circumstances may
the Crown give an award or title which normally conveys an Award, Grant, or
Patent of Arms to the subject of another kingdom without the prior written
agreement of the Crown of the individual's kingdom.  [Was (another clause).
The Board is considering three options regarding the term 'subject of another
kingdom':  a) to leave it unchanged; b) to substitute 'resident...'; and c) to
make some dispensation whereby a person might live in one kingdom and be
considered a subject of another.  The Spring issue of _Tournaments
Illuminated_ will carry a call for comment on this matter...]"

CROWN HOLDING OTHER OFFICES--  VI.A.1.e.2.b:  "No Sovereign or Consort may
hold any office in the kingdom other than territorial Baron or Baroness for
the duration of the reign.  [From (another clause), enhanced to match the 1984
Corpora restriction on the Coronet and to preclude serving as Coronet, which
was not formerly restricted.  The Board invites comment on the desirability of
the latter limitation.]"

UNDER POWERS OF THE CORONET--  VI.A.2.c.3:  "The Coronet may only call such
courts of inquiry as are approved by the Crown.  (See G&PD #3)  [From (another
clause).  The Board is particularly interested in comment on this
restriction.]

QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE PEERAGE--  VII.A.1.g:  "They shall have made every
effort to learn and practice those skills desirable at and worthy of a
civilized court.  To this end they should have become acquainted with fields
of period study including but not limited to literature, dancing, music,
heraldry, and chess, and they should have some familiarity with combat as
practiced in the Society.  [Alternatively, the second sentence might be edited
along the lines of:  'to this end, they should have some knowledge of a wide
range of period cultural forms, and should participate in Society recreations
of several aspects of the culture of medieval nobility.'  The Board welcomes
comment on whether it is preferable to list specific suggested fields of
study, or to make a more general statement in an effort to discourage the
merit- badge mentality.]"

PROVINCIAL ORDERS/AWARDS--  VII.B.3.:  "_Other Orders_.  Non-armigerous orders
may be extablished by a kingdom, principality, barony or province, according
to the laws and customs of the kingdom.  [The Board invites comment on the
desirability of eliminating reference to provincial awards, thereby barring
them, on the grounds that provinces have no ceremonial leaders to present such
awards.]"

     Orders of knighthood developed independently of "royal" decree, knights
were "created" by liegelords and depending on the vassel/lord relationship
and the timeperiod involved, (also cultural custom), knights could be created
by the nobles or the church.

     Some knightings were held directly on the battlefield, (much like the
knightings in the SCA of an unbelted just before finals).

     I believe that all this changes in the 13th Century with knighthood
becoming more "formalized" but I don't have the reference handy, (since I'm 
being a "serf" today to earn my daily bread.)

     Most reference sources, (found in college libraries or large public ones)
on the medeavil times differ on the exact proceedures for creating a knight,
but the generalities are what the SCA uses for their ceremonies and customs.
(Much like the "oath" of fealty sworn to the King).

Hope this helps,

This sounds a lot like the membership crisis a lot of SF conventions
have been going through for the 10 to 15 years.  The soultion there
has been to have the registration fees very high close to the event
to discourage last minute attendees.

There are some obvious problems with this for the Society, but parts
of it might be usable.

I suggest:

1.  There be a schedule of site fees favoring early "registrants".
    Say--(and this is arbitrary) $5 up to 4 months before the War,
    $10 to 1 month before the War and $20 at the War.

2.  All registrations sent in ahead of time will be able to specify
    a three level ranking of preferred campsite--this could be done
    either by physical location or by group.

3.  No registrations be taken closer to the event than about 3-4 weeks.

4.  About 2 weeks prior to the event, campsite allocations will be
    mailed back to everyone who registered ahead of time.

5.  Any registered space that is not occupied by some preset time into
    the event will be "deallocated" and up for grabs.  (Given the
    nature of some special areas--i.e. the Royal Encampment and
    Cariadoc's area--there can be limits set on who decides just
    how their unused space is occupied.)

I think the net effect of all this will be to encourage a little advance
planning on the part of some besides just the Autocrat and her staff.
The overall effect will be to permit people to arrive at least modestly
early and set up their camp--in their allocated space.  (I.e. You *know*
you won't have to move later.)

Obviously, it is too late to implement such a scheme this year.  If such
an idea is to be tried next year--the time to start working on the details
is *immediately* after this years Pennsic.

Subject: misc. comments

Unto the good folk of the net, greetings from Li Kung Lo! I depart here from
my usual practice of thrashing inflammatory issues that have pushed one of my
buttons to try and keep my hand in by posting some brief comments on some
ongoing net discussions.

Unbelted Kings: In kingdoms where the Crown lists are open, instead of by
invitation, it is much more likely that a great fighter without a clue as to
the nature of chivalry will ascend to the throne. In the East you do not need
to demonstrate wisdom, mercy, charity, restraint, or any other quality to
become king. You don't even need to be popular. You only need to be able to do
*ONE* thing... Hit people over the head with a stick and avoid or ignore their
attempts to hit you! Everyone is afraid to deal in specifics, because an
arrogant egotistical thug can wield considerable power in such a situation. Of
*course* I've seen kings who were not fit to wear a white belt, and some of them
have been knighted, even over the objections of considerable numbers of the
chivalry, simply because they fought too well to ignore them. This transfers
the shame of the unbelted royal peer to the entire kingdom, and to the crown
who wields the sword of knighting.  By the way, Yaakov- the idea that the king
reserved the power to make a knight, and that the knight owes some sort of
fealty to the crown is very late period, and although that pattern is followed
in the laurel kingdoms, for most of the history of knighthood, it was not the
case.

Pennsic Camping: Gee, before we go off the deep end, why don't we wait to see
the official plan, and then deal with it? If you don`t have a group to camp
with that will reserve space for you, why not find them through the Rialto?
Changes in local politics as well as Pennsic land problems dictate that
Carolingia may actually have a semi-real encampment this year, instead of the
usual 6 or 8. We're friendly, maybe we can work something out. Anyway, let's
not argue about the fairness or lack therof of a plan that isn't even official
yet, when we could be spending our time figuring out how to
survive/ignore/circumvent it.

Training: Gosh, I started training in sword and shield under the watchful eye
of Steen and John le Pell in Myrkfaellin Dominion, EK (Ithaca, NY-basically
Cornell University), and we didn't do any of this slow or unarmored stuff. We
did a thourough set of stretching excercises, and then were fitted for armor
while the rules of the lists were explained to us. Then John said, "This is a
light blow. When someone hits you like this, tell them it's light and
continue. (tap). This is good. When someone hits you like this, fall down and
say *GOOD* because you're dead.(CLANG) Now this is too hard. If anyone hits
you this hard, get out of the lists because they're dangerous...(SMACK!!!)" Let
me say here that as a master chirurgeon, I have never met a more concientious
and safe marshall than John, and I have seen *no one* injured at one of his
practices. An hour into our first practice we were going moderately fast, with
snaps and wraparounds (wraps), the only shots we were authorized to use for
quite a while. The moral here is that there is *no* one right way to train.
This argument is similar to martial arts schools arguing about training
techniques. Everybody has favorite processes,and suspects that the techniques
of others are wierd if not outright dangerous. Every system of martial arts
training (SCA or mundane) has strengths and weaknesses, and genuinely
dangerous systems rarely survive. However, different systems do place different
requirements on the teacher and student. John's system requires very good
armor and attentive marshalls, both of which are in abundant supply in
Myrkfaellin.

                                        In Service to the Rialto, 
                                        Li Kung Lo

A good scanner and a copy of Fox-Davies (or some such book) does help

Well, I was pretty amused myself, which is why I mentioned it... :-).

Duke Radnor of Guildemar did not win the first time he entered a
Crown List (although he went to either the finals, or the semis).
He did win his second Crown List.

Also, he has never lost a Crown List since.  This is part of the
reason "you need to be around" a while to win in the West.  If a new
"hot" fighter comes along, who seems unsuitable to be King, one of
the big guns enters the Crown List.  i.e. Radnor, Paul, James
Greyhelm.

The only time I could see an "unsuitable" new fighter winning Crown,
would be if they were a totally unknown (i.e. that they were that
good).  A few people have won that way, but weren't bad choices for
King.

Generally, one of the good (but not big gun) Knights win.
Eliminating any problem with an unknown.  (Usually, in modern
history, the big guns don't enter.)

     I never said that the "old ways" (being the way things tended to get done
*before* last year's bureaucratic fupups) *weren't* discriminatory.  I was 
merely bringing up the fact that the $5 fee was *also* discriminatory in a way
which may not have been immediately obvious.

     As to being "more or "less" discriminatory, that is entirely a matter of
opinion, and you are, of course, perfectly entitled to yours.  In a broader
sense, the world is discriminatory, we are not all equal, and some people
will *always* have advantages of one kind or another.

     I might point out, however, that the lottery system does not eliminate the
time factor discrimination you dislike, it merely institutionalizes it.  Gentlesshowing up on Monday morning get no better treatment then they did before the
lottery.  In fact, people will, if anything, tend to get more entrenched 
behind their site ropes this year, and less likely to "give,";  i.e., "We got
our site by LEGAL and OFFICIAL means, not just by getting here first, therefore
it's OURS, the RULES say so."  Dogmatism and unreasonableness just *love* rules
backing them up, sad but true.

     My tendency is not to punish people simply because they're lucky.  In 
this case, by my definition, "lucky" means, "for one reason or another has the
ability to camp for a long period of time at the war."  The "early" campers
must also be willing to live out of a tent for a month, possibly go without
pay for a month, pay a month's worth of camping fees, etc.  Once again, why 
shouldn't people who are both "lucky," and willing to make the sacrifices
necessary to take advantage of their "luck" get their choice of camping
spaces?  The people *I* know who go early don't go because they're rolling
in dough, either.  Most of 'em live in poverty for several months after the  
War, and I mean *poverty*.  Some of them quit their jobs every year in July,
and then have to find a new job again after the War.  But they are willing
to make that sacrifice, because they figure it's worth it, for what they get
out of the experience.  Is this *discriminatory*?  How so?

     Almost without exception, everybody seems to agree that the real problem
here is that of people, *whenever* they arrive, taking more space than they
"need."  Now, everybody will have an impulse to take more space as opposed to
less, simply to be more comfortable, perhaps intending no inconsideration.
The problem is, obviously, that for every group/person that takes *more*
space, some group/person is forced to get by with *less* space.

     So the problem we need to tackle is how to keep people from having more
people on their camp rosters then actually can show up.

     In past years (i.e., before last year), things were handled on a personal
basis;  if I needed a place to camp, and Dur was sitting on top of a hill, I
could go up to him and say, "Hey, Dur!  Do you mind if I camp up here on the
hill?"  He might say, "yasuryoubetcha."  Or he might say, "well, I'd rather   
you didn't, but those folks there have some extra space."  Or he might say,
"Armor up, I'll fight you for it."  But it was *personal*.

     Then, people started to put up ropes.  As in, "this roped area is for
me and my friends only."  And that required a response, because sometimes
people roped off too much, and denied land to other gentles that they really
didn't need.

     So, a response was LEGISLATED, and it was a POOR response, and things
were changed midstream, making things worse, and worse, and the multitudes
were pissed.  Last year made many, many people unhappy with "the system,"
but sometimes people forgot that "the system" was only one possible response
to the lesser problems of the previous year.  So the result seems to be an
attitude among the planners of such that what we need is IMPROVED 
legislation to solve the "problems," overlooking the fact that most of last
year's problems wouldn't have been NEARLY so bad if the LEGISLATION hadn't been
so faulty in planning and execution.

     What we need is *not* an overkill response to last years fupups, but
a measured plan to deal with the only *real* problem. . .people taking too
much space for their needs.  The current lottery plan, with its $5 "Honor
Tax" levy on top of the camping fees and having to move entire encampments
TWICE forces a great deal of trouble on a lot of people.  In my humble 
opinion, this is a case of the cure being worse than the disease, in a
situation where the disease actually wasn't all that bad to begin with, but
the previous year's "cure" WAS "that bad."  It seems that this plan is more
a reaction to the first cure than to the disease itself.

     I think that the reactions of the good Rialtofolk bear this out. . .
a good number of the responses to this issue mentioned the opinion that
the War was somehow "too big" and that it was somehow getting progressively
"less fun."  And fun is the whole point.  If the hassles degrade the         
enjoyment past a certain point, I'll do something else.  I'm not getting
paid to do this, and there are enough hassles in the mundane world.
    
     Maybe my friends and local group aren't a representative sample of
SCAfolk in general (probably not, anyway), but opinion is currently running
about 10-1 for the "I can't believe they're doing this, let's go do our own
small War" crowd.  To which I inevitably respond, "Good luck.  You'll
eventually run into the same problems they did.  Maybe you'll find a
better solution."

     I had a few suggestions for possible solutions, and I've since had a
few more, but that seems rather irrelevant, since it appears that, even as
the first announcement was posted to the net, the "official" and "final"
Pennsic bulletins were being produced.  Decisions final, no debate.

     My opinion on Pennsic regulation is that, because of who and what we
are, or are trying to be, a certain amount of injustice is preferable to
an equal amount of impersonality.  Iron-bound rules designed to solve
small problems by brute force are impersonal.  In the mundane world, brute-
force rules are the norm, and they, by their nature, bring everybody down
to the lowest-common-denominator.  In some ways, they have to.  If we get
too big at Cooper's Lake to have a personal War, we will also have to resort
to lowest-common-denominator rules.  And at that point, I will, quietly and
swiftly, leave by the nearest available exit.

     I still believe that a personal and non-bureaucratic method of dealing 
with the small problems at Pennsic can be found.  And I do believe that the
problems are small.  But they will grow, slowly, as Pennsic grows.  At some
point, we will cross the threshold into an area where we have no choice but
to either keep it from getting any bigger, or adopt rigorous regulation to
deal with the problems that personal interaction can no longer solve.

    But I do not believe that we have gotten to that junction yet.  There
is still room for personal interaction to work, in lieu of "impartial"
regulations that bind us all in impersonality and "Honor Taxes," that

This would be sort of fun if it were true...  As it happens, it is not.
Belted fighters and unbelted fighters who are on the invitation list
(typically 60 or so) and plan to contend must send a letter of intent
some time in advance of the Tourney (not *too* long in advance); thus
membership/residency requirements, etc. can be checked ahead of time,
avoiding potential Tourney day unpleasantness.

This sometimes happens if the total number of belted + unbelted fighters
who have "signed up" falls a bit short of a nice even number; then there
may (at the pleasure of the Royalty) be "last-minute additions" (who
nevertheless must fulfill residency/membership requirements, of course);
"last-minute" can mean "in the last few days between finding a shortfall
and the Tourney itself", in which case the Crown Prince or Princess may
make a few phone-calls; or, it can take on its literal meaning; as often
as not, however, there are just "bye" fights for the few open slots.

------------------(slight change of course)-----------------------------

Elizabeth Zwicky points to Duke Sir Laurelen as a MidRealm example of a
fighter knighted during Crown Tourney.  My recollection (possibly hazy
-- we're talking AS XIII) was that the other finalist in that Crown
Tourney who was knighted just before the last round was Sir Alen Elegil.

Non-belted MidRealm Kings have included Michael (of whom the less said
the better), Nathan, and Valerius.

And they're *selling* (according to Duke James).  They'd be Society-legal

I think the point you missed is the one I emphasised above.  The slow work
will give the novice the chance to learn out of armor without undue hazard.

At least in the West, it is common practice for even experienced fighters
to start with slow-work as a warmup exercise.  It's quite a sight to
see a field full of Knights and Royal Peers moving at 1/3 to 1/2 speed
the morning of the Crown Lists . . .

But certainly, it is desireable to have the Knightly virtues in a King--
at least in the Laurel Kingdoms.  *Without* naming any names, can you 
think of any King you've had that you feel did *not* qualify as a
Knight--taking into account those requirements other that prowess on
the field?

Various of our Great Officers return to the King (who then returns
to their keeping--thus confirming them in Office) various tokens
that fall in their spheres.  Things like the Great Seal of State, the 
Sword of State, and the like.

This, too, is separate from from Oaths of Fealty.

One of those clauses so nicely cribbed from Tolkien dissolves the
Oath if the World Ends.  I think that's one of the things that makes

     My my, isn't that spatial!  A minor injustice replaced by a major one!
Wouldn't it be better just to tell everyone that they shouldn't worry about
"bumping" someone from a site, because at least the person will only be
bumped once and not twice?
     I have to agree with the person who said that Pennsic has outgrown
Cooper's Lake.  At our current rate of growth, by the mid-'90s we'll have
about 10,000 people trying to attend the War!  We'd have to camp on the
battlefield and fight between the tents, if we could find any room between
the tents.  The best solution that I can see is to kill two birds with one
stone: raise the price of attending the War, then use the money to buy a
new site.  To deal with our increasing membership level, we could raise
the price every year until we moved.  The biggest problem that I see would
be finding a new site.  There just aren't that many spaces large enough
for our purposes, flat enough for our purposes, and not already occupied
by a large number of houses and other buildings which would present an
obstacle to our purchase of the land.  Perhaps we should first find a
site, and then raise the money to buy it.
     On the other hand, does anyone know of any campground that would be
better than Cooper's Lake?  I doubt it, but it doesn't hurt to ask...

     This is half right.  It is a non-issue.  But I cannot imagine what
"administration" and "bureaucracy" have to do with it.  As far as I know,
there's no officer whose official duties include keeping track of who has
sworn what oath to whom, or who is a subject of which Sovereign(s).  I
doubt that it's even relevant to our paperwork, bureaucracy, etc.  You're
assumed to be contributing to the activity of the Kingdom in which you are
currently residing, and attending its events, no matter which Sovereign(s)
you owe your loyalty to.  Therefore, you are counted towards the local
Kingdom's population requirement and recieve their newsletter.  That is
as it should be, and it doesn't have to have anything to do with who is
whose subject.

     So people are going to be required to swear fealty to the Crown of
every Kingdom they live in, in the name of making things easier for
everyone and avoiding bureaucratic hassles???????  That doesn't make
any sense to me.  It sounds like six of one (being the subject of one
Kingdom even while living in another) or half a *zillion* of the other
(the ancient sport of reconciling conflicting oaths).

      I just dug out a few old Acorns (Atlantian newsletter) from back
when they included a quarterly nose-count and compared those figures with
the ones Hal Ravn posted.  Some results:

From 31 January '87 to 31 March '89, our average rate of growth has been
11.563% per year.

Caid (currently weighing in at 1405 members) is the fastest-growing
Kingdom at about 19% per year.  At this rate, they will be about as
large as the West (currently 1619) in another year.  Will someone from
Caid please tell the rest of us how their recruiting methods differ
from ours?  ;-)

The Outlands and Calontir are the slowest-growing Kingdoms, both
between 5% and 6% per year.  Every Kingdom has grown.

The three fastest-growing kingdoms are also among the four largest:
Caid, the Middle, and the East.  They were ALREADY fourth, second,
and first in size (respectively) BEFORE this period.

Subject: Pennsic

One question about the land-grab policy:
If I am camping with a group and none of us can get there before Aug 6,
what do we do? 
I have limited vacation time, and yet have paid my dues and would like to
camp somewhere nearby, instead of in Ohio. If this is official policy,
does this mean that the war really starts on the 6th? I am sure it would 
be impossible to do, but I would have liked to see a mailing go out on
May 1, including this policy and a lottery registration form to be sent in.
This way, people who have jobs which do not permit them 3+ weeks of vacation
will not be penalised, and people who do not support the society by their
dues and still wish to attend the society's largest and most crowded event
may still do so by the good graces of their lottery rep, a paid member.

What thoughts?

Dani's summary is pretty much what was discussed at Cooper's Lake two weeks
ago by the committee appointed to advise the Autocrat.  Baroness Claire
may or may not put that policy into operation, and she may or may not 
modify it; but we'll know soon, because the Pennsic flyer went to press

I'm a bit amused, since my friend Fern is (oh, about) 220 lbs of

as a Lady's name (only at first... I never really thought about it...)
I'm sure he'll be glad of the news, however, that the name is 
at least somewhat acceptable :-)

Subject: Peer Density; Helm Costs

Peer Density:  Atlantia's roster of currently active Laurels includes
36 people.  We couldn't find a current roster of Chivalry, but think
the total is 35.  No convenient access to a Pelican roster, sorry.

Helm Costs:  from The Armoury (429 Rollingwood Circle, Fayetteville, NC
28305): simple spuntop helm (spun top, welded bar face) $60.
Prices go up from there - hard to determine maximum, because of
all the options they make available.  [Note: I have no connection
with this business other than as a customer]
Their catalog is pretty good - worth getting if you're interested
in armor.  The work is good quality, usable stuff - not necessarily
the prettiest I've seen, but it works.

Subject: Peers, Proteges, and Poetry

Unto all on the Rialto, and especially to Duke Cariadoc, Greetings!

Cariadoc:  Thanks for the limerick!

On the question of Laurels and Pelican and such: My feeling is that the attitude
may vary from Peer to Peer as much as from Kingdom to Kingdom.  Whether living
in an area where one attitude prevails may influence one's own orientation is
another story.

Some of you may remember Duke Frederick's long posting during the "Life After
Peerage" discussion.  He pointed out that some people are goal-oriented (i.e.,
they do it in hopes of getting an award someday) and some people are process-
oriented (they'd do it anyway, award or no award).  This discussion touches
that old one in some parts.

I am both an apprentice to a Laurel and a protegee of a Pelican.  The Laurel
is a Laurel in calligraphy, and his aim in taking me on as an apprentice was
1. to teach me the craft, and 2. to have one more calligrapher available to
take some of the burden off the Tyger Clerk.  Getting a Peerage never entered
into the discussion, and never will.  I guess (correct me if I'm wrong) that
Laurels basically take on apprentices in fields that are the same or related
to their own.  The political apprenticeship may exist, but I don't think such
an arrangement really has all that much to do with the real meaning of the
Laurel.

As for the Pelican, he's a chirurgeon and I'm not.  His aim, similar to the
Laurel's, is not to give me political support.  He figures that service to the
Society is service to the Society, no matter what its nature may be.  Maybe I
grow a little rhapsodic here, but I think his ultimate aim is to educate me --
to give me greater awareness of the workings of the Society as a whole.
(Remember, I'm a minor-level artisan and bureaucrat in a remote corner of the
East Kingdom; it's easy to stay buried in local issues and never wonder what
the BoD is up to.)  He never once said anything like "Hey baby, stick with
me and I'll make ya a Pelican" -- that never entered into it either.  I think,
like the Laurel, that he spotted another workaholic who might be useful to
the Society somehow.

It is possible to become a Peer without first having been someone's apprentice
or protege.  Master Robert was never an apprentice, and neither was Master
Johannes.  Actually, I'm sure that there is a huge list of Peers who were
never Peers-in-Training (hey Arnora, do we get to call 'em PITs?).

I'm just guessing here, but I assume the same is not true for squires and their
Knights or Masters.  You have to be a squire before you get belted, correct?

	Yes.  Someone I owe a rather large debt of gratitude to, in fact.
But at the time of his first reign he did not demonstrate all of the 
qualities that I've since come to expect in a knight, though he was (and
still is) one of the premier fighters in the realm.  Of course, at the time,
I was confused as hell by the fact that he wasn't knighted, but then I
thought that being a good fighter was enough... and put it down to SCA
politics (which isn't entirely untrue either...)  He has since (long since,
in fact) been knighted.

	Looking through the Order of Presidence that I have (only two 
kingdoms) I've found 4 unbelted kings so far.  Unfortunately, I left the
list at home, so I can't say who right now.  But I found (I think) 3 in
the East.

Subject: Heraldry on a PC and non-members at Pennsic

On the subject of non-members at Pennsic: The SCA is a club, NOT a country club.

To Cadrys ap Duas, who asked about heraldry programs for PCs: There was one
disk of heraldry clip art that came out for the Macintosh last year, but it
was said to be really bad.  Badger Herald sent me a quote from some senior
herald who had seen it, and the quote says it all: "Don't buy it.  Don't even
pirate it."

There really aren't any good disks for heraldry out there.  One of the WetPaint
clip art disks has some nice shield shapes and some things to paste on them,
but they aren't useful except for decorative purposes.

That's one project I would love to undertake in my copious spare time (hah!) --
create a set of useful graphics for heralds in particular and SCAdians in
general.  Does anyone know of a designer who needs a project?

By the way, who won Trimarian Crown Tourney?  Did Arlof do well?

A few years ago, I heard about this neat thing called the SCA.  "Wow!" sez
I, "sounds up my alley!"  Then I begin to hear other things.  New poeple
being treated like ...well, pariahs?  Peasants?  Honest efforts being greeted
with derision.  Fun little things like that.  I decide I dont have the time
anyway.

In the present: I decide now is the time.  Mentioning my intention to other
people, I am warned about the local group.  I should be careful--Ill be a
(gasp!) "new person."

What do I find?  A group of happy, helpful people.  It seems I missed the
worst of the snobbery period.  I have heard, though, that perhaps I "just"
missed it.  Perhaps it was one or two particular people.  Maybe.  I dont
know for sure...but I have yet to see any sign of ANYTHING wrong about
"new people."

Yes, perhaps we don't look perfectly period just yet.  Pardon my dock siders,
folks, I haven't had the chance to make boots, I was too busy mesing up
my new T-tunic.  Or getting a hold of a decent belt to wear.  Or something
like that.  Im trying, though!  

The point is (if I havent lost it somewhere..hmm, ah yes, there it is!) that
for every "newcomer" at an event (I wont comment on Pennsic as apropo for a 
newcomer, I have yet to experience it!) is perhaps a person who will be willing
to LEARN what the sca is about--even/especially if they dont know yet.

That is, if they aren't scared off first. (1/2 smiley .} )

Everybody started somewhere--perhaps our mythical overexposed (cough) maiden
and her "not really" friend will fall in love with the SCA and make a run
for Art/Sci awards?  We can only find out if we give them a chance!

I was surprised to see that Ariel assumes that you have to be a squire in
order to be knighted. That is not true in any kingdom I know of; I wonder
how widespread the assumption is.

So far as Laurels and Pelicans, I think what Ariel describes is the normal
situation in most of the kingdoms I know of--certainly I would be
unwilling to take an apprentice in any field I did not consider myself
competent to teach. Indeed, I have decided against asking at least one
lady to be my apprentice on the grounds that, in the art we have in
common, she knows about as much as I do, so I have very little to teach
her.

In response to Hal Ravn, I can think of at least one king who I voted
against knighting. He eventually got knighted, and I think by that time
deserved it, but I have no reason to believe that my opinion of his
qualifications was wrong at the time. He was, incidentally, a pretty good
king as well as a very good fighter. I can think of other kings who, by my
own opinion or by reputation, were probably not knights, whether or not
they had been knighted. If your kingdom has never had anyone win the lists
who is not qualified for knighthood, then either you are under divine
protection, which I think unlikely even for the senior kingdom, or your
standards of knighthood are a lot weaker than mine.

Milord, I beg to differ.

My personal feelings are that anytime something hard and reasonably
heavy is moved towards someone else's unprotected head, there's
a grave chance of injury, regardless of the speed you are moving.
For instance, what happens of he flinches and catches the corner
of your sword in his eye?

Just because a gentle is put into armor does not mean that said
novice gentle should be subjected to fast work.  On the contrary,
I agree that the novice whould be trained at dead-slow rates.
However, I also believe that at any time that there's a sword
or other weapon being swung at a person, that target should be wearing
a modicum of protection - a.k.a. "armor".

Subject: Personna, A vortex mechanic's point of veiw.


Unto the good people of the net, Russell Almond, Vortex Mechanic
(sometimes known as Mustapha al-Muhaddith) sends greeting and wishes
for peace.


I have been disturbed lately by comments I've seen on the net such as
"So and so doesn't have a personna," and "A personna isn't necessary,
especially for a novice" and "I don't like to do research so I don't
have a Personna" and the like.  I feel that such statements show a
basic misunderstaning of what a personna is and what it is for, and
what one can do with it.  More importantly I feel such people are
missing at least half the ****FUN!!!!!!***** available in the SCA.  I
hope to remedy this by giving my personnal views on the subject.

The basic reason for a personna, just as the basic reason for the garb
requirement, is to create the *Suspension of Disbelief* that allows us
to be in the current middle ages rather than in the 20th century.
Thus calling someone "Milord/Milady" instead of "Hey, you!"
contributes to that suspension of disbelief just as not talking about
computers or car problems does.  In the SCA world, we are all our
personna's, nobody doesn't have a personna, they mearly have a 20th
centruy personna rather than one belonging in the middle ages.

Of course, new members, even ones at a first time event, shouldn't be
excused from the personna requirement, just as they are not excused
from the garb requirement.  Putting on a very simple and generic
middle ages personna requires much less effort than putting on a T
tunic.  Changing your standard greeting from "Hi, how's it going?" to
"And God give you good day" does remarkably well to put you in a
medival mindset, as well as the person you are addressing.  Changing
your form of address to "Milord/Milady", not talking about obviously
modern things.  All these things are simple to do, can be (and should
be) explained to a newcommer in 5 minutes before his first event, far
less time than it takes to explain to that person how to make a T
tunic!

Two problems arrise after taking that first view of personna, the
first is that you say "That's not a personna, that's just what you
do?"  Having a long and complex personna story is not what a personna
is all about.  What a personna is about is trying to do
improvisational theatre, to be someone from a different time an place.
Long personna stories (especially ones which read like a bodice ripper
romance, rather than a real history) get it the way more than they
help, real personna are based on little things from the culture that
produced them.  A person with such a genneric personna as described in
the previous paragraph is a European from somewhere in the High Middle
ages, a good starting point for many personna.  It will become more
specific as time and research goes by, and if you stay a European from
the High Middle ages, it may not change much, but your appriciation
for the role will grow and you will have more fun with it.

The second problem is that people have nothing to talk about in
personna.  The answer to that is research.  With research you can tell
period tales and anecdotes, you can talk about philosophy,
mathematics, religion, history and natural history.  You can compare
world views with people from different cultures.  You can debate the
merrits of archery vs pike in winning the English civil war, the worth
of the new system of numbers used by the Arabs, all kinds of wonderful
things.  

"But I don't have time for research" you protest.  Research for
personna doesn't need to be as detailed or as thorough as that you
would need to beat Mistress Niccola at Ice Dragon.  Anything counts as
period research.  Reading period fiction, or history about times in
places in period.  Looking at pictures or museums.  These things give
you interesting things to talk about, and help you understand your
personna, the role you are playing.  They help you enjoy your personna
more and have a better time at events.  And they give you a reputation
as a well read and informed person to talk to, someone whom the
nobility and gentility would seek out and want to have at their
courts.

If you are like me, interest in the middle ages is not the primary
reason you joined the SCA.  What you really wanted was the friendship
and fellowship of other eccentric, intellectual, romantic people.  People who you
could talk to, and wouldn't think you odd, people you could date and
wouldn't laugh at your outdated notion of romance.  The SCA is full of
such people, but their enviornment of operating is the middle ages.
In order to sound intellegent and intellectual in front of them you
must study the middle ages (no real problem, if you fit the above
discription, your are probably a voracious reader, just add a little
bit of medival history and literature to your diet).  The respect you
gain will be immense and worth the effort.  And you'll find out the
next secret of the SCA, reseach is like peanuts, once you start you
can't stop.  

Having likely gone far beyond the attention span of the people I am
trying to reach, I will stop with but a few closing remarks.  Personna
is easy, rewarding and fun (as is the research that leads up to it).
Furthermore, it is an integral part of the suspension of disbelief
that allows the current middle ages to exist.  When you participate by
developing personna (something far easier to do than making armour or
running and event) you add to both you own enjoyment and that of those
around you.  It is altogether a good thing.  

For another missive, I will save the tast of analysing how the concept
of personna fits in to the day to day life of the current middle ages.

May Allah grant you peace, prosperity, and an interesting and fun
personna.

Milady, pardon my peevishness, as a participant in the "GeekNet."  I am
somewhat sensitive to such words, please forgive me.

Now, as regards your words on Pennsic attendance... I heard rumors at last
year's Pennsic which suggested that this year, Pennsic XVIII, would cost
$10 more for non-members than members (XVII was a $5 difference), and XIX
was to be open to members-only.  This was upsetting to me, as it would
exclude the TuChux (whom I find rather entertaining, though I have only
slightly interacted with them), myself, and many of my friends with whom I
camp.  The fee-differential is reasonable, though much greater and we
would become members without question, and parallels similar policies at
most SCA events I have attended -- $1 off for members, and such.  Basically,
this is the biggest incentive I can think of to get people to be members --
make it essentially free, if they go to a few events, and a discounting
effect if they go to a lot.  If they only go to one or two a year, then
fine, let them remain non-members.  They can still play the game, live
the dream, part of the time, even if they can't live it as much as I, or
you, can.

I'm not sure it's practical.  At best, we could start planning and
saving money now to have an alternate site in place five years from now.
 (I'm talking about a SCA-owned site.  If anyone thinks that another
campground can give us a better deal than the Coopers, go ahead and try
to put together a proposal.)

The very least we can get away with is to get a very large unimproved
piece of land and arrange to have 5000 people worth of portajohns,
portable showers, water trucks and some generators rented and brought in
for a couple of weeks.  Legally.  Can this be done?  What would it cost?

At the other extreme, we can try to essentially recreate what we have at
the Coopers.  We'd have to put a lot of capital improvements in place. 
We'd have to buy it and to maintain it. There would probably not be an
alternative to having full-time caretakers on site year round, both to
maintain it and to guard it.  To pick a number not quite out of thin
air, we'd have to go to a bank and borrow something over a million
dollars to do this.  ('We', in this context, would not be the SCA, but a
legally separate entity borrowing money against the income from future
wars.)  That would mean about $150K per year coming out of the admission
fees just to service the debt, so this would not be a particularly
cheaper site.

There are many variations to these alternatives, but none of them
constitute easy answers.  Until someone gets tired enough of the
Coopers, or otherwise sufficiently motivated to research an actual
proposal, I'm going to continue assuming that most of the suggestions
that periodically raise their heads are impractical.

Subject: Knighting Kings
Message-Id: <8290@pucc.Princeton.EDU>

Someone raised the topic about unbelted fighters winning the Crown,
and someone else (I think) recounted a tale of a King of the East
Knighted by the King of Merides at Pennsic. (This is all from memory.)

Now, as I understand medieval knighthood, the King created all orders of
knights and appointed all knights--later on recomendation of the peers.
But, all poer and authority over the various orders of peerage ultimately
owed allegiance to a King (or a religious authority) who could appoint
anyone he pleased.  Furthermore, only the king could 'make' a knight.


So, who knights the king?  Or, isn't the king defacto a member of all
orders of peerage--at least while wearing the crown.  Perhaps
it makes sense for an exiting king to be knighted by his successor
(especially if the king displayed the essential knightly qualities
during his reign), but who could knight an acting king other than
the king himself?

An excellent point with which I wholeheartadly agree.  Here at
Princeton, I am the *only* student member (so far) who has been to
a 'real' event.  As a result- 1) I know some people from outside the
immediate area; and 2) My enthusiaism for SCA is about 20 times
higher than most other students (exception being someone who was
a member in Caid before coming to P-ton).  The ONLY SCA stuff these
people have seen is commons, garb making, and the occassional unarmored
fight practice (when we were conducting such things).  To them, SCA
was 'interesting', but not something to waste any real time over.
Not until we had two events in p-ton did people start to get
seriously interested. (I am taking at least one new person to Crown
as a result of last weeks demo.)  If newbies are limited to
strictly 'local' events, they will almost certainly drop before they're
'qualified' for 'real' events.

As a counter point, one of the people who got me interested in SCA
told me her first event was War and that she loved it.

Why do people want events to be for members only?

If it's for money the SCA already has a surplus of funds.

To restrict attendance? SCA events are already difficult to attend, because
people need to get garb and often feel out of place until they learn to
talk and act. Are we going to further discourage new people by requiring
them to be members, or by charging them fees for being non-members?

I think this attitude is counter to the ideas the SCA was built upon.
We're folding our arms and saying "if you want to play, you have to pay",
without a good reasons. I think perhaps we should investigate alternatives
before reaching into people's wallets.

Subject: Peerage relationships

[Sorry if two copies of this get out; I think the previous copy bounced.]

Well, having just esquired to Master Steffan ap Cennydd a full four days
ago, I may as well toss in a data point, and a comment or two.

"Esquire" is Steffan's term for his Pelican proteges (it sounds better than
"Pelican egg", which seems to be the most common informal term). He takes
Esquires on for several reasons, not the least of which is that Corpora
(in my understanding) says that it is the responsibility of all Peers to 
take and train dependents.

Personally, I was interested in esquiring to Steffan because of his strong
emphasis on "SCA philosophy" -- why we do things the way we do, where the
Society comes from, and where it is going. One could consider this the
equivalent, I suppose, of apprenticing to a Laurel for a specific art. His
reasons for asking me to Esquire were, I gather, largely the same -- I'm
one of the few people who actually *likes* to argue this stuff for hours
on end...

Having said that, I suggest that these relationships probably can't be
quantified by Kingdom; they are a very personal thing. For example, I doubt
that my reasons for esquiring to Steffan are the same as those of his other
retainers, let alone those of the retainers of other Peers. The relationship
between a Peer and his or her retainers is quite complex, and there are
probably as many different ways of dealing with that relationship as there
are Peers...

	This just about hits what I found of interest in Hal Ravn's
question, but let me rephrase that question into another: Are there
any fighters that you, if you were making a crown list, would invite
because you think they would make a good king, but you would say that
they are "not a knight", or should not be knighted?

	For example, arrogance in a king is perhaps not a great sin,
but it is a greater problem in a knight.  One might think an arrogant
man (or woman) "worthy" to be king/queen, but not to be knighted.
What, specifically, is necessary to knighthood that is not necessary
to good royalty?

My complaint about arts and sciences competitions follows that kind of line.
What happened at our event was a result of the idea of "well I'm just a begin-
er SCA person so I won't enter even though I've been doing appropriate cal-
igraphy styles for the past ten years.


I think the idea is to take away the formality of some of the competitions un-
less one is attempting to be a master (as of master vintner etc).  Our shire's
attempt at solving that problem is to create a fun day.  No real competition,
a few plays and a few arts and science tables to give the atmosphere of the 
country fair.  I think it will be less intimidating for beginners who would
like to jump in without fear of being criticized.  I think more such relaxed
events would encourage study rather than intimidate beginners.

Did that make any sense?

>Who is 'Black' Michael, and what did he do?

I myself know only a few shreds of anecdotes and the bare bones of an
outline.  My only knowledge of the matter of Michael of Boarshaven
comes from an history published by Baron Daemon de Folo, who was
active at or around that time.  However, I merely read this history
once some time ago, so I do not remember many of the details he
presented, and because he was a person who was initially friendly with
Michael, others may have some different perspective on the history.

There are people who yet live who were active at the time (I do not
know if Cariadoc was then in the East); I have my doubts as to whether
they wish to discuss it.  Believing that even a tale of evil rampant
may instruct the wise (that they may be vigilant and prudent), I shall
write a few words.  I merely hope that those more knowledgable may
correct my errors, elucidate my doubts, and contribute their own
knowledge.

Michael of Boarshaven was from Wurmwald, sad to say.  He was a natural
fighter, who wielded the sword as if born with it; if he had any other
particular interests, they are not recorded.  Fairly soon after he
began (a year, perhaps?), he won the Crown Tourney of the Middle
Kingdom and became Tanist.

The first act ascribed to him as Tanist occurred at the Fourth Pennsic
War -- or, rather, did not occur.  This war gained infamy (as if it
were possible for it to gain more infamy) via the song "You Can't
Swing a Broadsword in the Forest", by Duke Master Moonwulf.  The
Creator must have repented of His pledge never again to flood the
Earth; it did in truth rain 40 days or more before and during the War,
so that it was feared that flooding would take lives.  Duke Andrew
(then our King?) earned well the surname "SeldomRest" for his tireless
efforts in the rain, clearing the roads of bogged vehicles and other
labors.  Michael stayed in a hotel and gave little help.  It may be
said in his defence that, as he had money enough to do so, why should
he be physically miserable?  Nevertheless, it demoralized the people,
who grumbled and doubted the Tanist's honor.

Near the time when Michael was due to ascend the Throne, a burglar
attacked him at his job (as a guard).  Michael was in hospital with
amnesia, so severe that it was feared that he would be unable to be
King.  As there were no laws concerning how the realm could exist
without a capable King, and no provision for appointing Regents
without the King's prior consent, consternation filled the kingdom.
But Michael recovered his memory and powers in time to be crowned.
Now it is obvious that He Who is Omniscient had, in his infinite mercy
toward his people, sent a portent: that a thief would come in secret;
that by him the Crown would forget all honors and honor, and lose its
rights and properties; that after a time of healing the Crown would be
restored.  But none read the signs properly.

So Michael of Boarshaven came to the throne, with Andrew SeldomRest
as his Tanist.

Michael's Queen was Zarina, now a Duchess but then in her first reign.
It is not recorded that there was any love between them, yet what
could have been a peaceful reign together soon degraded into
bitterness.  Eventually, Zarina declared that she could no longer
tolerate the abuse Michael showered upon her, and she abdicated her
Throne, an novelty utterly unheard-of.  Many, having experience of
Michael's abrasiveness, sympathized with her.  Michael remained
without a Queen for the remainder of his reign.

There was a feast in northern parts of the Midrealm to which Zarina
arrived late, on the arm of a certain gentleman.  Michael became
angry, saying that she who had abdicated had no right to the
Countess's coronet that she was wearing.  He ordered her to remove it
immediately, or he would declare the feast not to be an official
event, and force it to cease immediately.  Being wise, she merely
withdrew with dignity, coronet still in place, and still on the arm of
her gentleman.  As this gentleman was Moonwulf, Baron of Rivenstar,
most of the feasters (being his subjects or sympathizers) bundled and
left with them.  Her wisdom prevented an unseemly halt to the feast
while preserving her honor.  Many applauded her and criticized
Michael.

Many other incidents occurred, which unfortunately I do not recall, if
I ever heard of them.  His subjects' disgust with Michael increased,
matching his reciprocated disgust with them.  The Royal administration
ground to a halt, as he had no interest in his proper work, nor even
in the Royal glory, as there was little of the latter left.

Eventually, he decided to abdicate.  Even then he had no concern for
honor; he refused to return the Midrealm crown itself.  A friend went
to Michael and convinced him to give it over for return to the Curia.
When he had left with the crown, Michael then called the local sheriff
to have this friend arrested for theft!  (A thief accusing an honest
friend of his own crimes.)  When the sheriff learned the facts,
fortunately, all charges were dropped.  And if Michael of Boarshaven
was ever seen again, it has not been reported.

Tanist Andrew SeldomRest then laid the crown on the empty throne, and
announced that he would wield the Royal power until the proper time
for his coronation.  No law permitted him to do so, but because he was
known to be honorable and valiant, the Curia and the lords and all the
people acclaimed him and took him for their lord.  In his regency and
reign, King Andrew took care to heal the wounds dealt by his infamous
predecessor, and his reign was a great success.

I am told that the crown of the Midrealm was damaged, and that Michael
removed some stones.  I am told that the damage has been suffered to
remain, as a reminder of the duties of the King.

Few laws were changed due to Michael's reign.  I do not believe that
there is yet a regency law in the Midrealm.  Furthermore, the King's
word is law, binding for all time.  He need merely take prior counsel
of his Curis and proclaim the law in open court (with a certain pair
of Curia members in attendance).  Presumably, the Kingdom Seneschal
could block an evil law by refusing to attend Court.

However, that reign is one of the reasons the Middle Kingdom Crown
Tournament is by invitation only.


If any reading this note can correct me or add more information,
please do so -- I would gladly welcome it.
