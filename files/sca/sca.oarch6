	How many people here dislike Steinbeck's 'realist's works
as much as I do?  If you do, you will be amazed at this book, as
much by the choice of work as by Steinbeck's own reasons for wanting
to do it.  The work is _The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights_
based on the Winchested Manuscripts and other sources.  Written in 
1958-9 in Somerset, England, what we have is unfinished, and was not
corrected or edited by John before his death in 1968.  It was first
published as a trade paperback in 1977 by Del Rey, and is out again
in paperback.  It is in seven sections, "Merlin", "The Knight with the
Two Swords", "The Wedding of King Arthur", "The Death of Merlin",
"Morgan le Fay", "Gawain, Ewain, and Marhalt" and "The Noble Tale of
Sir Lancelot of the Lake".  It also includes an appendix containing 
letters from John Steinbeck to his agent and a friend, a treasure in
it's own right.

	Steinbeck notes in the forward that it was Malory that first
sparked his interest literature, particularly Caxton's Malory.  It was
the memory of this that prompted him to bring the tales into the 
modern vernacular, even though a part of his original love was the
charm of the old tongue.  He certainly did an excellent job.

	An example of the charm of the stories, an excerpt from "Gawain,
Ewain, and Marhalt":

	"In the morning of the tournament, when lovely ladies took their
places on the stand and the competing knights prepared their mounts and
chose their spears with care, a page boy brought a parcel to Sir Marhalt
in the tiltyard.  Unwrapping it he found a blue silken sleeve embroidered
with threads of gold, and he fastened it to the crown of his helmet so that 
it would float like a pennon when he rode.  And when the knights marshaled
to choose sides, the lady saw her blue sleeve streaming from Marhalt's helm
and she was glad, and even gladder when he raised his great spear in salute
to her.
	"The fight was long and glorious, for there were good men engaged,
and the judges and the ladies in the stands under the colored canopy leaned 
forward, seeing the subtleties, noting the scores, for they were expert in
the sport and knew flamboyance from good solid knightly skill.  And as the 
day progressed on single quiet knight, without fuss and feathers, met
everyone who came against him and unhorsed each one, and such was his ability
that what he did seemed easy, almost casual. The watchers made marks for points on scraps of wood, and when the trumpet called the cessation, there was no 
arguement.  The golden circlet was brought to Marhalt where he kneeled 
bareheaded before Lady de Vawse.  It glittered on his short cropped graying
hair, and then Sir Marhalt thanked his hostess and strode to his lady errant
and publicly offered the prize to her.  She swept her headdress off with one
motion and, blushing, leaned forward, and Sir Marhalt placed the circlet on her
brow, and the company applauded the skillful knight and the equally skillful
lady."

	Yet another section notes the ideas often discussed in alt.sca,
women fighters and the effects of archery.  I heartily recommend this 
book.

In the Middle contact Richard of Sable Tree, the Archer-General (address and

in the process of being written but will probably not include a cart (the

apparently be a clout and a timed shoot, the latter starting from 75 yards.

	NO!  NO!  NO!  NO!  NO!

	Do not, under any circumstances, get 20th-Century lawyers involved in 
the running of the Society -- it is a confusing disaster.  I know from
bitter personal experience early on.

	In the case of Society apprenticeships, the demands of 20th
Century law about wages and labor conditions do not apply for two
reasons:

	1)	The "apprenticeship" is not a business relationship, in
that neither party gets his or her main source of livelihood from the
relationship.  If the "master/mistress" and "apprentice" sell their goods
outside of Society contexts, 20th-Century partnership laws may apply, and
income tax certainly does, but unless the "m/m" is paying income tax and
Social Security (not to mention State Disability Insurance and all of the
other official thieveries), the labor law doesn't.

	2)	The applicable legal form is the _Medieval_ articles of
indenture or apprenticeship.  Since this apprenticeship exists only
within the context of the Society, the proper pattern can be found in
existing documents from the period.  
		I remember once reading a modern English rendition of a
14th-Century apprenticeship contract (London Guild of Fishmongers, I
think),	but I can't remember where.  Unless I am greatly mistaken, there
should be such documents extant from at least 1200 on.

	20th-Century lawyers are mostly good for stirring up animosity
and increasing the cost of living -- most of 'em would have been hanged
for barratry (stirring up lawsuits without cause) in period . . .

Good Gentles  (hmmm... better not spell *that* wrong ;-)


I am seeking the words to two songs... "Barett's Privateers" and 
"Men"   "Barrett's Privateers" is a fequently sung song in the SCA, so I
don't think I have to describe it.  "Men" however, is not commonly sung...
I believe that Martin Mull is the one who is know for performing it.  There
is a chorus chanting "Men...Men...Men..." in the background, like a military
cadence, with one lead singer.

Some of the verses are...

It's good to be on a ship out at sea,
surrounded by Men ...men...men...



All of us are manly men and none of us are sissies.
Late at night, we turn out the light,
and blow each other kissies,
'cause we're all Men ...men...men...


Thanks in advance for any leads sent to me,

Greetings from Lady Orianna,

I have been experiencing a definite problem lately with Courts and am
interested to see if any of the gentles of the Rialto have found the same
thing disturbing.

At a goodly number of Courts here is the East, in particular a number of
recent Coronations, there has been a great quantity of bare steel flying
around the room.  At several recent Coronations, the Crown Prince's
retainers have charged into Court with bare swords, etc. flying, taking
over the court and threatening the current Royalty.  From rumors that I
have heard the next Coronation in April is going to involve "killing" the
King before the Crown Prince is crowned (apparently a Mongolian
tradition?).  I am sure that this is, and has been, with the consent of all
parties involved and is really just a staged display.  However, I find it
extremely disturbing!

When I joined the SCA, one of the first things I was taught was that you DO
NOT draw a blade (sword, dagger, whatever), unless you are going to cut
yourself a gobit of meat or butter your bread.  I find this tendency to
wave bare blades around, PARTICULARLY in a Royal Court , makes me *very*
nervous.  It is also giving new members AND CHILDREN the wrong impression
of how to handle live steel.  This *is* live steel folks, being waved
around in front of a very large group of people.  Coronations are
considered one of the biggest and fanciest events of the year and, as such,
get a lot of novice SCA members and members of various ages attending.

How do you react to a child threatening a playmate with a dagger and, when
disciplined, responds with "The King does it"!?

At one Coronation, we even had retainers with bare blades bouncing through
the assembled crowd, over chairs and around people.  Someone could have
very easily gotten hurt.

Does anyone else out there have problems with this or is this just my own
bias that a steel sword is a real weapon and, therefore, dangerous?  I know
it is lots of fun to show off your steel, wave a real (rather than rattan)
sword or spear around and make everyone impressed.  My personal feelings
are that I am NOT impressed and am very glad that a mundane vacation is
conflicting with Coronation so I do not have to attend.

Again, this is just my opinion and I would be interested in hearing any
comments on same, from both sides.

Greetings from Lady Orianna vander Delft:

Not too long ago, our local Barony went through this discussion.
Different autocrats had different ideas on this and we ran into some
problems at a couple of events because of this.  Therefore, the Barony made
the decision that everyone, regardless of time, effort, or order of
precedence, will pay full price for an event except for Royalty.  My lord
and I have always paid full price for events that we autocratted.  We found
that providing discounts for various individuals with various levels of
work can get very tricky (and could easily lead to 17 people cooking just
to get into the event free -- and not having enough food to cover that many
extra people).   However, there is always the element of the *autocrat's
discretion*.  If the autocrats feel that there is an overridding factor (we
have a couple of cooks that love to cook and never eat), the autocrats can
make exceptions to that rule.  BUT, this must be decided ahead of time
between the autocrat and the gentle involved, not the day of the event with
the entire kitchen crew (I use the kitchen crew only as an example.  I have
heard of cases where group officers were allowed discounts due to their
attendance being part of their duties).  The same holds true for Royalty.
If, on the off chance it should happen, you are running a fairly expensive
event and you have four sets of Royalty (8 gentles) coming (King, Queen,
Crown Prince and Princess, Coronet Prince and Princess, Heirs to same), you
could lose a lot of money.

Good luck!

Hi.
  
   I've gotten a bunch of obnoxious mail in response to my
posting of our group's event.
 
  1-  For reasons I don't know and don't care about at the moment,
      our event was not in Pikestaff.  With a day to go before the 
      event we had very few reservations.  I was trying to get some
      last minute people.  We did, in fact, get a gentle from
      Carrilion because of the posting.
 
  2-  It was posted world because:
        A- I was very rushed and didn't have time to figure out
           how to post to just New York, New Jersey, and New
           England.  I'm not even sure if that's possible.
 
        B- Some machines around here have convoluted news feeds
           and don't get locally posted messages.

   My attempt to make our local newsletter available to the Known
   World (not posting, just anonymous FTP) was replied to with
        A- messages letting me know it doesn't work right (I'm
            working on it
      
        B- Annoying message reminding me to smail to Crown, etc...

    About 98% of stuff on news is complete garbage.  I'm trying
    to make useful information available in a timely and convenient
    manner. 

    If this somehow bothers people I guess I will not bother.  I
    know that at least some people appreciate it.

Subject: Not dead after all
Message-ID: <890221033225.7.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

It seems that the rumour of my death was a bit exaggerated. The
morons who administrate the local net said they were shutting down
all 300 Baud lines permanently because nobody uses 300 baud these
days. But after two weeks, I discovered that they had opened a
300 baud line after all. So here I am again, ready to throw myself
into the current discussions. 

RE discrimination:

I don't know anything about American law, but *common sense* says that a
voluntary society like the SCA should be allowed to make up its own rules
without government interference. The key here is that we are a *voluntary*
group. If you don't like the rules, nothing forces you to join. It would be 
silly for a Christian to join a Synagogue and then complain because he is
not allowed to eat pork at their meetings. And what if you are a female
Roman Catholic and you suddenly feel this urge to become a priest? Okay,
you can form your own church. But you can't sue the Catholic church for
sex discrimination.

Thus, if the SCA wanted to bar women from fighting, or if we wanted to
make any other rule that would hinder somebody from doing what he/she
wanted, how could a democratic country have laws to stop us? As long as
our rules only affect what is done within the Society, and as long as
nobody is forced or coerced into being a member, we can have any rules we
darn well please.

RE the theory of the SCA:

The recent discussion about knighthood for archers, etcetera, has brought up
some interesting questions. Has SCA knighthood any relation to *medieval*
knighthood, or is it just a reward for chivalrous behavior and skill at arms?
If it is only an award, then we can certainly give it to archers and fencers
and martial artists of any ilk. The arguments presented against this have all
been based on historic facts about medieval knighthood, and therefore on the
assumption that KSCA has someway a connection with historic realities.

But if SCA knighthood is supposed to be modelled on the ideals of western
European medieval knighthood, this implies that we *are* depicting a specific
time and place, or at least a specific culture, namely the one where such
knights existed. Namely the Age of Chivalry.

I am trying to say that knighthood for non-rattan people has consequences for
the theory of the SCA as a whole. In the recent discussion about non-Europeans,
people on the net managed to convince me that the SCA allows these personas
precisely because we are *not* trying to re-create any specific time or
place. We are depicting pre-17th century culture, period. In that case, the
whole present system with tournaments and a knighthood modelled on medieval
knighthood falls to the ground.

It falls down because it locks us to a specific time and gepgraphic area.
It is no longer adequate because we suddenly have lots of other ideals
(e.g. Japanese and Chinese concepts of honor) and other ways of fighting
(e.g. mongolian mounted archers and 16th century fencers) which are not
recognized at all. If the SCA is to be a group for *anything* before 1600,
SCA knighthood must cease to have any tangible connection to western European 
medieval knighthood. Or else, we will end up being terribly unfair to all those
skilled people with personas from other times and cultures whom we have 
allowed in the Society.

RE households:

Households are clearly period, but I sometimes wonder if they don't belong to
the Middle Ages as they *were*, not as they should have been. What I have
seen of households has been more bad than good. I guess the household system
would be very good if everybody belonged to one. But there are many who don't,
and unless households are very aware of this, they may easily become a mecha-
nism for excluding new people.

At events, it is all too common that households send one person to the site
with the feast gear, as early as possible. This person then grabs six or eight
of the best seats and puts out the feast gear for the whole household. Soon, 
all the good seats have been occupied in the name of various households and 
those who don't belong to a household will end up at the lower end of the 
table with the newbies and the undwanted. Very nice for household members, bad
for others.

Also, households mean that many people isolate themselves from the rest. It is
at table that you can get to know others, and as long as many people only sit
with their household, how can anybody get to know them? I think it would be
much nicer if people made it a point to sit with different people as much as
possible, to get to know somebody new every time.

I would like to know if anyone can name a single way that households are good
for someone who is not a member of the household. If they only serve to support
their own members (against outsiders), then they are in conflict with the 
basic ideals of the Society. 

Yours,

William de Corbie

Message-Id: <YY0=MPy00WHm80klBw@andrew.cmu.edu>


     I'm sorry fighting gets dull. I offer a suggestion from Rolf Schwartz here
in the BMDL who is often working to make things better. He came up with the
"Cumulative Melee Tourney", in which one person really wins, half of the
fighters sort of win, and everyone fights every round. I had fun with it.

     The first round looks like a normal SCA tournament, in which each fighter
is matched against one other, and one wins. BUT! in the next round they are a
team, with the previous winner acting as captain. These teams are set against
each other, getting bigger each round. Thus the final round is a melee with half
the fighters on each side. You will note that the captain of the winning team
was never defeated, and may be considered winner of the tourney. You may also
note that having half of the fighters win means you can give them prizes and
make them feel good. Losing doesn't seem so bad either.

     Be advised that teams matching by challenge invites dullness. If all the
heavy duty winners conspire to get together at the beginning the outcome is
evident. No chance = no game = no fun.

     I know this doesn't solve the problem of the non-fighters interest, and I
will post again sometime about the medieval style tournament we had here once.
Therein lays something for heralds, political wranglers, and potboys.

	It depends very much on when and where.  The middle of our 
period, falling around the millenium, would be strongly Christian, 
though with some pagan survivals, certainly less than your statements 
imply.  Note that even such an outlying region as Iceland was converted 
around 1000AD.  The idiological center of our period, the age of chivalry
in the twelvth and thirteenth centuries, was most certainly Christian,
and any pagans around would have been a persecuted minority.  You seem 
to say that with the last line I quoted above, but the insistance of the
lines above it required this responce.

	Of course, as our Knights and Masters can easily tell you, what
persona your character is doesn't matter to the SCA, but the same arguements
used in the 'non-European' debate show up again here.

"A good woad substitute is magic-marker.  It is easily obtained, inexpensive,
easy to apply, and washes off fairly easily (some brands require more scrubbing
than others).  Magic marker though will run especially in summer months when
you sweat a lot more, so be careful.  Another substitute I have used is 
acrylic paint.  Its problem is that it runs too, and if you do not throughly
scrub yourself afterwards, you will be blue for a few days."

	The rest of the article covers other practical considerations of
dressing Pict in SCA.  I saw this gentle at Border Raids in A.S. 22, and
was impressed with the effect he achieved.

Early Period was (I had to let my subscription lapse due to lack of funds,
so I don't know if it is still in print) available from

David and Rebecca Wendelken
202 E. 4th Avenue, Apt. 2
Rome, GA 30161

When I was recieving it it was $2.50 an issue, and cheap at the price,
with back issues available.  They were always interested in new
articles on things pre-1066.

	Sorry this took so long, and I still haven't found the source
I was looking for, but I know of three references to women fighters in
Norse literature.  One is a nameless Amazon in tale of Arrow-Odd, another
was in the tale of Halfdan Eysteinsson, a Princess Ingigerd, sometimes
known as Grim.  The third is from memory only, where the main character
and his company meet a woman who wears armor and fights like a man.
One of the company wrestles with her and narrowly wins, and they get
married, both in thier armor, and have a very tranqil marrage, though
she never stopped wearing armor.  Unfortunately, all of these are from
the more romantic Norse tales, and appear beside Giants, dragons, Ogre's
of various natures and wizards, and it can not be told how seriously the
writer intend these women to be taken.  But certainly the idea is not
foriegn to the Norse.

	The two tales mentioned by name can be found in _Seven Viking
Romances_, printed my Penguin.  The translations are done by Hermann
Palsson, and Paul Edwards.

	Adding yet more fuel to the fire, another set of numbers for the
battle of Crecy.  These are found in _The Art of War in the Middle Ages_,
C.W.C. Oman.  Professor Oman gives Edward's army as approximately 11,000
men.  He gives the breakdown of the three English units as: 

under the Black Prince, on the right wing, 800 men at arms, flanked by
about 2,000 archers and 1000 Welch spearmen.  

Under the earls of Arundel and Northhampton about 500 men at arms and
1200 archers.

And under King Edward himself, a reserve of 700 men at arms, 2000 archers
and perhaps 1000 Welch spearmen.

His analysis of the battle was that it proved that the archer, when
adequately supported by dismounted men-at-arms, could beat off the most
determined charges of cavalry.  Looking at the map of Crecy, it looks as though
a flanking movement by the French could have changed the outcome, but the
lack of discipline in the French ranks prevented that, and even more than 
the English bows, that this was the deciding factor in the battle.  Indeed,
at La Hire, nearly a century later, the Knights of the French were able to 
get amoungst the English archers and the result was a rout.

Message-ID: <890217005800.204020DF1F1@venus.tamu.edu>

Good Evening All,
   I am curious as to your varied opinions on the subject of households. 
Households are a mixed blessing. They provide a number of useful services
and functions, especially for people new to the society. It is usually
impossible or impracticle for a single person to have all the accoutrements to
really enjoy an event, Tent (large enough to be comfortable), pavilion, food,
garb, transportation, feast gear,  etc. while several people can easily support
such things. In addition you also get added security, company for lulls in
activety, and if it is an event any distance away from home- someone to make
you not feel so afraid (I don't know if any of you remeber (or have ever) gone
to your first away event alone, it can be a very scary place).

     There are however downsides, households by their nature are oligarchical,
who ever is head of the house-hold decides what happens (admittedly like any
social system there is a lot of play in decision making, but in essence this 
is the way it is). Further Households in smaller groups (shires etc.) tend to
have a lot of power in the shire/barony/whatever, so that what the head of the 
household wants, happens to the entire group. A lot of this power comes in 
from the care and feeding of newbies by said housholds. This can take on a 
dominating presence in some cases. In addition, there is always those that are 
not taken into a household, such people can often feel very alienated from the 
society in general.

    To sum up, I just want to say that households can be very useful, and a
source of a lot of support, espcially for those new to our society. Households
can also be a source of political squabbles, domination, and alienation.

Subject:  SCA culture: its not just yogurt

Is the SCA a recreation of mid-evil culture or a culture unto itself.

    The SCA is a culture in and of itself, and it should remain that way. We
are not a recreation group like the various civil and revolutionary war groups
in the United States or similar groups in other countries, we do not attempt to
re-create famous battles to the man, rather we attempt to create "the middle
ages as they should have been." We, as a group, feel that there are things from
the middle ages that are better than things in our modern day. Our group feels
that it is better to make something which we are proud of, something which we
have imparted a piece of our spirit in the process of creation, than to throw
together the minimum nescesary for the purpose. We the members of the society
feel that honor, that outmoded virtue, is valuable and should remain of
consequence, no matter how difficult it may makes our lives. We feel that
modern mundane society lacks something, some elegance, some colour, some zest
that can be found in the middle ages. This is in part "the Dream", the quality
which makes our SCA lives somehow more pertinant than our other lives. Any
casual observer can point out however that the middle ages were not filled with
this magnificance. Life in the middle ages had its drawbacks, for the vast
majority it was short, brutish, and dirty, yet we try to avoid such nasty things
while retaining the good parts. In many ways the good parts directly resulted
from the nasty things, so to keep the one but not the other use our
imaginations and creativity. We base our interal power structure on ability,
the most able fighter in the land shall be king, a concept totally foreign to
almost every form of government in human history. Varience in religions is
given true acceptance instead of just lip service, while not allowed to
intrude upon anyone. We encourage well rounded individuals instead of
specialization, the peers of our realm are those who excell in conduct,
knowledge, service, and grace. In everything we do there is a dichotomous sense
of deep veneration and light irreverance.

well what do you think?

Greetings!

	In response to the posting by Lord Krister von der Hadnfalke
concerning the Man at Arms idea.  The idea of 'lances' being used in
competition is quite a good idea.  Such a competition would provide
an arena to have 'mini-battles' between various knights and their
retainers throughout the Knowne World.  Perhaps this type of competition
could be used at some of the Wars, not necessarily as a war point, but
rather as a tournament.  

	On a different vein, the unbelted fighters in Calontir are
divided into three groups:  Housecarls, Fyrdmen, and Men at Arms.  The
Fyrdmen and Housecarls are kingdom-level orders whereas any fighter not
in either of these orders may claim to be a Man at Arms.  

	Do any of the other kingdoms have similar awards.  As far as I
know, Calontir is unique in this respect.  Please correct me if I am in
error.

Re Peerage:
Thanks to Arnolf and Siobhan for their thoughtful
answers on life after peerage. While speaking for themselves,
I feel they speak for many of us.

Re: Belts.  In the middle, only white is reserved-white belts
for knights, and white baldrics for masters at arms.  Red is
not reserved, and neither is green.  I was present at the court
in Northwoods where apprenticeship to Laurels was announced as
a possibility for those who wanted it, and it was specifically
stated that green was not a reserved colour.  The tradition
of (non-reserved) red belts for squires pre-dates me, so I
can't prove it.

On to food:

1. Unto the gentle folk who wrote with their addresses:  I am
   nearly ready with the vegetarian/kosher/allergy food article
   and I look forward to mailing it and getting your remarks.
   Thanks for your patience.

2. Two comments on Digest #242, which I am making public
   because they are matters of policy with me.

a.  Lord Cyrus, I didn't think it was necessary to provide

    I received my Laurel for Medieval Domestic Technology.
    Among my specialities are medieval recipe interpretation
    and Apecius. Mundanely, I have a Master's in classical
    archaeology. There are some areas where I am expert,
    and a lot more where I am not.
    I enjoy sharing and learning with ANYONE who cooks.  I find
    everyone I talk to has something else to offer.  For example,
    last weekend I had an engrossing conversation with someone
    who knows what it's like to keep strict kosher.  (No bunnies,
    even eaten reverently...)
     For another, in today's news, Lady Malice pointed out the
    virtues of Pillsbury dough, and I thought, what a great way
    to make quick sausage rolls! Thanks, my lady!
    I'm interested in corresponding with any other cook,
    so welcome an opportunity to talk more specifically with your

   I can't discuss your comments.  As a matter of policy, I

Subject: Fence and Chivalry: a view from the bottom

Unto all to whom these vile amber rays come doth Marco Palladio di Soncino
send warm greetings.
OK, so it shows that I'm new to this Rialto stuff. A few ramblings regarding
the fencing peer debate sprang to mind.

First...Mr. Litchfield, I hope your doublet is flame retardant and I'll make
it calm and brief. As a fencer whose interest started in mundane strip
fencing, I feel qualified to inform you that crossing over to SCAdian fence is
not as easy as one might perceive. The entire approach is different and the
stupid mistakes that a mundane fencer will make against a rapierman are
difficult to unlearn; to gain proficiency in two-handed fencing in the round,
one must be in it for some little while. Certainly, anyone who would stick
with it long enough to overcome the initial pitfalls and gain more than barest
competence in rapier is going to catch an acute case of The Dream.
On the matter of challenges for honor, it is true that those who give and take
offense could find themselves specifying weapon form. But where fencing
knights could be found would also be found a proliferation of good if non-
peerage level rapiermen (persons? Sorry Rowan...). Your reductio ad absurdam
is quite a concept, also, but really now. Superior dancers, dancing being an
art, may become Laurels. An aspect of this debate was whether fence was an art
and should similarly be treated. Side note: dance-offs are not entirely
absurd...I can think of one challenge wherein one combattant, when asked if
there was no other way to settle the dispute, replied "No! We could Galliard!"
As to Ansteorran Dons being peerage-equivalent, it was my impression that this
parallel order was not considered peerage level, but I will accept the word of
someone with first hand experience. End of flame.

I believe it was Donal Artur who noted that the rapier is not merely a
brawling weapon. While we are used to the images conjured by pirate movies,
two points are worth noting. One: the rapier was developed initially for
fighting heavily armored opponents. The transition rapier is a brute just
heavy enough to withstand a glancing broadsword blow, yet thin and narrow
enough to tick away at the joints of medium-to-heavy armor. This is then
clearly a military weapon. Two: the late rapier and its progeny, the court
sword, was the weapon of choice for noblemen to settle personal disputes as
well as being the sidearm of upper-middle class commoners. The seconded duel
is period to Italy at least, though it may be a bit late for other parts.
People with more time for research may take this up as they see fit...the
point is that high nobility also indulged (?) in rapier combat.

The feeling strongly expressed by so many that peerage means more than
specific skill -- that a knight should be exemplary in his conduct at all
things and, if not stunningly proficient, at least reasonably adept at a wide
range of activities -- is one I share, and an image that The Dream seems to
promote in most people. This at least establishes that stick jocking is not
the _sole_ criterion...

As far as burnout goes, I think the benefits of taking on an apprentice for
perking up accomplished but jaded souls has been well enough documented. The
joy of teaching is not to be underestimated.

                       Yours in service (and ramblings of marginal merit)
                                      to crown and Society, I remain

In our local group, site fees are one of those things that everyone
expects to pay. Feast fees are sometimes waived as an incentive for
service, etc. Of course, it's also traditional that *if* TRM and TRH
attend, they get free for everything.
 
Others, tho, expect to pay. Servers, cooks, and entertainers in some
cases get a reduction in the feast fee, but seldom can we afford to
reduce or eliminate the site fee, for fear of not having enough
money to pay our expenses.
 
I've always bought a ticket for my lord and my daughter when I was
autocratting. If things were tight, I've bought a ticket for me!

M'lady:

In Anglespur@East, we used to give free admission or sizeable discounts
to workers at events.  Here in the West, the Royalty are
often presented with free tickets to events.
These are the only examples I can think of where anyone gets
in free to an event.

  Some people I know who are swashers (fencing, cavalier types) want to wear
firearms (non-functioning) with their garb. You cannot argue the periodness of 
such accoutrements, the wheellock came out in the 1500's. Yet I was apalled, I
find the concept of carrying a firearm so outside of what I know as SCA as to
shock me into silence. Most people I talk to agree that Firearms just are not
acceptable, but what is the feeling at large. 
  I don't think firearms are acceptable for the same reason that a truely 
chivalrous person would not use a bow on the field of honor. You do not have
the one to one contact with an opponent. ANYONE can pull a trigger and defeat
someone, but it takes courage and honor to stand before someone and face them
with traditional weaponry.
   Firearms to me just are not SCA, one of the earliest ways the sca was
described to me was "..we try to make the world as it should have been, back 
before guns came out". I am in general a "liberal" I see the sca as a growing
expanding culture, and if it is fun and doesn't bother anyone go ahead do it.
Yet this one thing drives me nuts.

Baron Henry of Linlithgow OSO ("Brewing Technology") here:

Note: These are my opinions, not those of the Middle Kingdom Arts
and Sciences offices.

With regard to A&S competitions: to me, when I judge or enter,
authenticity is important.  So is product quality.  But, for
a competition entry, you should be willing to make a special
effort.  The special effort in beer is mashing from grain,
using leaf hops, and doing the research to know what is
and is not period in beer.

This said, I'll note that beer doesn't do particularly well
in A&S contests.  If there are criteria, you will want to read
them carefully. Note the weights given to various aspects.
Note the instructions to judges in the criteria.  Then decide
if you want to enter and possibly get kicked around under these
criteria.

For example, Middle Kingdom wine criteria specify that fruit wines
should taste of fruit, not like wine.
My fruit wines have a bouquet of fruit, and a taste of wine. But then,
grape wine doesn't taste like grape juice.

In short, a malt extract beer made with pellet hops, be it ever so
good, I would never score over 20 out of 30.

Was Hael!

Subject: The Order of the Sagittarius

    One correction (I'm pretty sure) to your comments.  I don't
    believe that the Sagittarius is an Order of High Merit (ie. Arms
    Level Award).  It seems to me that both it and the Guardsman
    (sic) are non-armigerous. 

Sorry, no.  The Order of the Sagittarius is one of the FOUR "Orders of Merit"
of the East Kingdom.  They are:

Tygers Combattant - rattan fighting
Manche            - arts
Silver Crescent   - service
Sagittarius       - archery

All four of these awards are of the same "rank".  If the recipient does not
already have an Award of Arms, then an AoA is simultaneous.  In the East
Kingdom, the most usual way of giving a Grant of Arms is with Court Baroncy.
There are no other awards (in the East) which Grant Arms.

No wonder new members (and some not so old) don't know how to address
various 'titled' persons.

So, you can't be a 'Don', but you can be a 'Don of Fence' (in a 'fighting
        guild')
    you can't be a 'Master', but you can be a 'Master Brewer' (in a 'brewers
        guild')
    you can't be a 'Apprentice', but you can be a 'Apprentice Brewer' (in
        a 'brewers guild')

So to answer your question, m'lady; yes, there are apprentices that are *not*
'squired' to a Peer.  It seems that guilds or guild-like organizations that
attempt to keep period or period-like naming for their members often get to
use 'reserved' words in a different style.

I often wonder if the reason that so many 'traditional' customs in the SCA
have remained traditional is:  If they were made official there would be
'Official Confusion'!  Then the BOD would have to sort out the 'what, how
and why' for the new naming.   ....and how long would THAT take.

These discussions do come in cycles, don't they?  To repeat a previous
comment: George Silver, gentlemen of 1595, opposed the learning of rapier-
fight because it did not support a civil society.  Rapier-fight was not a
defensive art or a war art but an art used only in duelling.  Since rapier-
fight was contrary to Silver's notion of an ordered society he opposed it;
since it was of no use in the wars he opposed it further.  In the Middle
at least one of the major (if not the major) duty of a knight is to support
the Prince and the realm in the wars; although I don't doubt that rapier-
fight is an enjoyable pastime it does not directly support the Prince and
should not therefore be rewarded in the same way.  In the Middle at
least the knights also tend to be competent archers in the war shoot.

Greeting from the Shire of Anglespur of the East Kingdom.  Some
months back I posted that our monthly(well almost) newsletter
was available for anonymous ftp.  Some gentles replied quite
favorably.

The problem was that our evil text processor only output for Xerox
PDL, IBM1403 (line printer) and Tektronix 4010.  The newletter was,
therefore, posted in a plain-text/ascii version.  Well, the new
version of the text processor can now output postscript!!!

Our January newsletter (the last complete issue) is available, with
all it's intended fonts, as ~rogoff/newsletter on life.pawl.rpi.edu.
Could someone please try this and tell me if 1) it works, 2) it
prints correctly (I've tested it on an Apple Laserwriter off a Sun),
and 3) is this something people want?
 
Thanks and look forward to the February ( March?) issue.

Subject: site fees


I was at a recent meeting of my local shire(Highland Foorde, Atlantia).  We
were discussing an upcoming event in our group and one of my people
asked if group residents had to pay the site fee.  The autocrats said yes
and the person who asked became somewhat distressed at the idea,
sighting that they had never paid a site fee at any event sponsored by their
home group.  The ensuing flurry of debate was VERY intense to say the
least....  In the end, I had to put on my senechal's hat and wade into the
middle and settle the issue myself and all parties decided to pay the site
fee.

Can anyone out there tell me if they have ever heard of such a practice?  I
am basically curious as to whether there are any conditions(such as being
autocrat, hall master, cook, etc...)imposed on such a practice.  I personally
have paid site fees for every event that I have ever attended.

Any takers on this one?

Subject: body painting


Can anyone out there tell me of a better way to apply fake tatoos?  I am a
pict seeking a better and more durable method in the form of a pen.  Here
is a summary of the methods I use/have used/have heard about and their
good and bad points:

	Food Coloring--one good sweat and you can share them with
everyone you touch.  Takes forever to remove.

	Theatrical tatoos--the kit I have used is really nice, but
requires a paint brush, 2x time to get them on, and there is not enough
there for a full body job.  (DOES ANYONE KNOW A SOURCE FOR LARGE
AMOUNTS?)

	Permanent markers--work real well, very durable, but can be
real hard to get off(at least for me).

	Permanent overhead projector markers--this has worked the
best of all of them, but I find that they get kind of powdery and leave a
blue haze(Hendrix was confused about the color, I'm sure.).  I still haven't
tried all the brands out there yet, but I think that the problem MAY be in
the medium anyway.

	Blue latex paint--rumored to have the choice of the very drunken
individuals who crashed court at PWXII.  From what I heard, it took a very
long time to get off.



Also, are any other gentles out there who do Pictish?  I sure would like to
hear from you(maybe we can start a club or something).

I am posting this message for Lord Kristen von der Hadnfalke.

================================================================


As a fencer and an archer and not a rattan fighter, I've been following the 
discussion of knighthood for folk like us with great interest.  One reason I
GAFIAed ten years ago was the Caerthe then cared little for the arts, which
I was also interested in, but gave great honor only to rattan fighters.  Beating
one's head against this kind of wall was painful to say the least.

Anyway, the *period* solution stares us in the face.  In the Middle Ages there
were Knights, with their full panoply of mounted war, but also each knight
might have up to a half dozen retainers in partial or little armor, riding if
at all on plow horses, armed with bows, farm implements, etc.  These guys
were called "men at arms" and their "platoon leader" (not the knight) was
the Sargeant of Arms.

The solution for us then would be to create a separate parallel order for 
archers, scouts, and fencers, perhaps with the title Master of Arms.  This
way we give and get honor for our battle skills, and demonstrate Period
recognition for those people.  A Squire could then be elevated to MAA (Man
at Arms) and after a period as a MAA decide whether he wanted to continue
rattan training to become a Knight, or branch off and become an archer/fencer
etc.  Established archers/fencers could unite themselves with a knight to 
form what was in period called a "lance" - a knight, his squire, sargeant of
arms and assorted retainers.  This opens the way for some interesting war-type
team competitions between lances from the various kingdoms.

If this, or a similar concept is begun, I would certainly re-join the SCA 
in spite of all the other changes which appear to have taken place in the
last decade.  Its a shame that the SCA doesn't formally recognize the martial
skills of non-rattan fighters, because these troops did provide many of the
period victories while the knights were bogged down.  Let's browbeat the BOD
into making some kind of ruling on this ASAP!!

     According to Compleat Anachronist #38, and other sources (cited in
CA38), the usual rule seems to have been that the body was cut as a
long rectangle, with sleeves stitched on at the shoulder (the seam was
sometimes covered by an embroidered band around 1100, but I think this
had gone out of fashion by the end of the 12th century).  Gores were
added at the sides, or at the center, or possibly, in some cases, both.
The basic shape would be something like this:
       __________________      __________________
      !             !    ??????    !             !
      !_____________! neck square, !_____________!
                    ! round, or "V"!/  <--gusset may have been used
                    :              :

     The shoulder seem seams ( ;-) ) to have been a straight line until
the 14th century, after which it was cut in a curved shape like that used
in most modern garments.  However, the seam in the sleeve was not always
positioned under the arm, but frequently went at the front or back, with
the top of the sleeve cut like this:
          _____                      (To make this from a standard sleeve
     __---     ---__                  pattern, cut off the seam allowance
   _-               -_            _   on both sides, cut off part of one
  !                   -_        _- !  side, fasten it to the other side,
  !                     --____--   !  and return seam allowance to the
  !                                !  new edges of the pattern.)

     Some of the later sleeves were also cut out of two or more pieces,
and shaped so that they spread out at the base to cover most of the
shoulder, and then set into extra-wide armholes, approximately like this:
         ..________..
         (sleeve) !          (I haven't quite figured out how this was
         ..____   !           actually made - the diagram was rather
               !_/(body)      complicated, and I haven't looked too
               !              closely at it yet.)
               :

     These topics are covered (and documented) much more completely in
CA #38, #39, and #40, and I recommend them to anyone who is seriously
interested in period costuming.  My only complaint about them is that
much of the interesting and useful information is embedded in a rebuttal
to _The_Evolution_of_Fashion_ by Hill and Bucknell.

It would appear from this, that if the Society continues to grow and
knowledge of it becomes widespread, that we may change the effective 
of the law.  We make make swords something that is "ordinarily carried
in public places by law-abiding citizens."  I wonder how long this will
take?  (But then--*I'm* not a lawyer.)

Subject: craft apprentsiceships

In the Jan/Feb 1989 issue of Handwoven, there is a very interesting article
on apprenticeships.  Hadweavers, in common with many sca artisans, are
fascinated by old ways of doing things, and many have found apprenticeship
arrangements appealing, but have gotten into trouble with 20th century laws
and attitudes.

Here are some things to watch out for:
	Any labor done on goods shipped across state lines must be paid
	for at least minimum wage---or you can be sued for double wages plus
	court costs plus up to $10,000 fines.

	Some states require minimum wage even on goods sold in the state.

	On-the-job training requires that the worker be paid a wage, but
	teaching someone a skill they wish to learn does not.  The
	difference is supposedly based on who benefits, but like all
	legal matters, depends mainly what agreements are written down.

I'm no legal expert, but we have several lawyeres in the SCA.  Perhaps
someone who knows (or can find out) something about labor law could
write an article for TI, including a draft contract that would be a
reasonable legal agreement for sca apprentices and masters to sign.

Any takers?

Subject: medieval fabric names


Another useful tidbit from the Jan-Feb 1989 issue of Handwoven. On
page 105:

	Medieval Fabric Names
	
	Exantium, Samit, and Samette were names for a rich, expensive
	fabric with a "six-threaded silken warp", used especially for
	church vestments during the 12th to 14th century.
	
	Ciclatoun was a "thin glossy, silken fabric, frequently with some
	threads of gold interspersed; used for vestments and for teh
	dress of nobles."
	
	Camoca or camak was a fabric woven from "probably fine camels'
	hair and silk, mad in Northern China" during the 14th century
	and used for vestments and bed coverings.

	Fustian, "originally produced at Fustat (Cairo) in Egypt, is a
	fabric having a linen warp and a thick twilled cotton weft, which is
	cut on one side showing a low pile."  Fustian was frequently used for
	church vestments (chasubles).


They cite Richard Glazier "Historic Textile Fabrics" for the quotes.

If anyone can find me more information fustian, I might be interested
in weaving some.

Subject:  NY laws & pagan periodicity (separate comments...)

Friends, Gentles, Dreamers, Fisherfolk --

A couple of comments...first, NY's laws on dangerous weapons are actually
nice to see...they have a little phrase which speaks of "intent".  This
means that one must intend to use their toys in a manner which reasonably
prudent people would believe criminal, such as killing or robbing.  That
phrasology is notably missing from Massachusetts statutes, rendering our
laws (which, incidentally, forbid far more of a laundry list -- I may
post a complete list if there is interest demonstrated) an easy tool to be
used against any collector who is moving his/her collection, any SCA-folk
travelling through or to an event in-state, and in general, anyone the
"authorities" wish to harass.  In other words, watch your step in MA!!!
(This knowledge comes from experience in which a group doing a photo-
shoot for a school advertising project were hassled, $1200+ of weaponry
was confiscated, and assorted other insanities occured.  The charges of
"possession of double edged weapons" have been disallowed; our next move
is a civil suit, so I can do no more than point any interested gentles
to the highly biased newspaper reports which were published at the time.
Please request directly, not through SCA-net)

Next, as to Paganism's periodicity -- what do you *mean*, saying that
the widespread semi-religious, semi-administrivial belief system did
not pre-date Christianity, and indeed fall right smack-dab in the middle
of our period, and most definitely of note, in the middle of the only
area that is inarguably part of the dream -- Western Europe!?  Pagan
holidays and festival times were most skillfully wrought into today's
Catholic calendar, at many points even absorbing traditions of the pagan
folk into their own observance traditions!  Observe Christmas, falling
ever so conveniently close to Yule; and Easter, right nearby the Rites
of Spring/Vernal Equinox; more can be found, I don't have the two
calendars in front of me here to compare in detail, unfortunately.  In
fact, it is much more period to have 'wise (wo)men)' floating around
than it would be to have consecrated Bishops/Priests/etc. of the Roman
Catholic Church.  The degree of authenticity of a pagan persona depends,
as all personas do, on careful research, finding a period and area where
paganism did exist, with or without Church outposts nearby.  This is
not hard; it is, in fact, far easier than concocting a reasonable
explanation for a Japanese persona's presence in mid-period England or
France.  I think the problem whose correction was attempted by the BoD
was the presence of truly 'magical' personas, ones who could do things
which were, at least by recorded history, not possible at the time, or
now either, such as walking without trace on newfallen powder, or flying
without mechanical aids of some sort (DaVinci's designs might have been
possible to use, however...)

Just some thoughts to think about...

Message-ID: <890215180914.20400CA5121@venus.tamu.edu>

Good evening,

     I wanted to ask a few questions (and make a few obs.) about brewing.
First of all, How are beers made from extract recieved? I know they are not
period, but it can be a real hassled mashing and sparging for a whole grain
batch. (Plus some of my best batches have come from extract batches).
Personally I think that they should be recieved a lot like the use of fabrics
that are not %100 natural fiber in sewing, if they had them they would have 
used them, further it is very hard to tell the difference. What about pellet 
hops? Leaf hops are rather annoying to deal with and I get better consistancy 
between batches with pellet hops.

     Now a question about the best way to go about brewing an ale for
A&S competition (esp. those wich may have uninformed judges), is it better to 
make a more period brew with lower carbonation and less hopping which people 
will probably be unused to, or to increase the carbonation and hopping so as 
to make the brews closer to what people expect from modern practices. (i.e. do 
you go for authentic, even though they may not like it, or what they will like 
even though it isn't authentic) I find that I want to brew in period style and 
ignore the fact that judges might be corrupted by modern american "beer" styles.

     What should the alcohol content of kumiss be? If it is fairly low I would
like to use ale yeasts which are a bit sturdier and use conditions which I can
come up with quite easily. (it Being that we had use our air conditioner
yesterday...75 C and 85% humidity...yuch) However if the Alcohol content is
higher what kind of yeast can I use to avoid the "winey" sourish taste that a
lot of wine yeast produce?

     Now a question about classes of beverages, there is a group of potables
which I am at a bit of a loss to classify, they are alcoholic potables, usually
aged, they are not usually fermented or distilled but rather take there
alcohol from the constituants. I am refering to such things as Revenge, and
Michael's Morning Tea, and Doc's Medicine (the last two are rather local terms)
which are often concoctions which require a great deal of preperation and
ageing. They usually have a fairly high alcoholic content (ranging from %5-%20
depending on variety, taste, and chutzpa of imbiber). They are often delicious,
some I have tasted remind me of 3 year old meads. Fortified wines will often
describe them but it misses on several points.

     Also can anyone point me towards some period sources for
descriptions/recipies of ales etc., I am trying to find things wich could be
used in documentation type activites.

          Of course Dani did not need to mention modern sights, silencers, and
balance weights which are innapropriate for the SCA. BUT! can I have some
opinions about  my "period" range marker? When I was amazingly cheap, and
serving as the archery "Iron Key", I used arrows of different lengths. (The
aformentioned garbage arrows) The different points could not be used to aim
with. In order to aim at all, I wrapped strings around the bow limb to provide
an aiming reference. I later adjusted the strings for 20, 30, and 40 yards. I
use decent arrows now. So, am I cheating?

     P.S. Once an alleged archery marshall  inspecting my bow moved my
knock-point just before a war shoot. He said "it was in the wrong place".
Guillame, a local great guy with archery, wrapped cord around my bow string to
make an unmovable knock-point. I also reccomend this for those of us who can't
tell which end of the string goes on which end of the bow.

Since ya brought it up...

I'm afraid you're wrong here, though I'm not surprised.  The
Sagitarrius is an Order of Merit, and ranks equally with the Silver
Crescent, Manche, and Tygers' Combattant (respectively the EK awards
for service, arts & sci, and fighting).  It has very few members,
which accounts for the general confusion over how it ranks.

Subject: Women Warriors in period

        In response to recent discussion about women fighting in period:
        The Orlando Furioso is a wonderful piece of Italian epic poetry from
the 16th cent. (currently available in a verse translation from Penguin
Classics)  It concerns the adventures happening around the time of
Charlemagne, so it is both written in period and about period, albeit two very
different sections of it :-)  There are probably about twenty 'knights' who
have enough play to be considered major characters.  Two of the best fighters
are female.  Bradamante, cousin to Rinaldo, is one of the toughest and bravest
of the Christian knights, and a major plot running through the book is her
attempts to rescue her lord-in-distress, Ruggiero.  It is worthy of note that
Ruggiero is on the side of the African forces.  Saracens in this work are not
necessarily evil, just on the other side and, incidentally, damned in the
afterlife.  Many of them are fine and noble people in -this- life however, and
are honored as such by the Christians.  But I digress.  The other notable
female warrior is Ruggiero's sister, the tempestuous Marfisa.  These ladies
are -not- portrayed as being in any way less worthy or skilled than their male
peers.
        This is, of course, fiction, but it is period fiction, and gives us
some (I think) useful insight into medieval attitudes about female fighters.

Yours in service,
Alexander Scott

Subject: Life After Peerage / Fealty

Well, here are a couple new subjects, anyway...
Regarding life after peerage, yes, if you think of a peerage as an end, you've
got it all wrong -- it's a beginning. Now you have responsibilities that
weren't there before. It's nice to be courteous, chivalrous, of service
(brave, thrifty, clean, reverent...) But now you have a _responibility_ to be
all those things. In short, you're an _exemplar_. You're expected to be an
_example_ of the SCA at its best. That's a terrifying responsibility, but
_THAT_ is what you're being asked to consider when the King and Queen call you
before the throne and ask you if you're willing to accept a peerage (and if
they don't imply that you can say no, they've done it wrong.) A peerage
doesn't mean that you're somehow more-than-human. It is not a deification to
some nirvana-state where you can sit and bask in adulation. Being a peer --
well, an *ACTIVE* peer -- can be tough. Your motives are questioned (why is
doing this? He's already a Pelican. He must have an ulterior motive!). If you
act like a nobleman, you're haughty. If you don't, you're "not really peerage
material". No, no, not everyone thinks that way. But enough do.
But what does the award really mean? It means you've done something nifty in
the club. That and 75 cents, etc. Your landlord isn't going to waive your rent
and your professor isn't going to excuse you from finals. So you have to have
another reason for doing what you do in the club. You do your art (and I
include fighting here -- knighthood is just a Laurel in fighting) because you
seek perfection -- a "personal best". You do your service because you have,
yes, a Dream of making the SCA better somehow.
Consider: The awards that have meant the most to me were not the Pelican (a
reward for a job that at least _some_ people thought well done), but being
chosen their Champion by the Ladies of my barony, and of the Borough of
Felding meant these people who knew me thought
enough of me to trust me to defend their honor. They thought I was a nice guy.
Even mundanely. Wow. I never got over it.
Now, if you have the right perspective, you won't burn out. The artist will
keep trying for that personal best (aanyone know Master Johannes von
Nurenstein? *That's* the kinda Laurel I'm talking about...). The Pelican will
keep trying to change things for the better. The peerage will maybe give them
a wider audience, but that isn't the end of it for them.
Ah well, another button pushed, another rant. My apologies if I've bored any
of you.

Unto Lady Marian Greenleaf of BMDL, Greetings from Lord Fridrikr Tomasson,
Sycamore Herald
Hi Marian (and everyone else):

To answer your inquiries about the White Scarf of Ansteorra, it bears with
it an automatic GRANT of ARMS, which makes it quite a bit higher in
precedence than the Guardsman (sic) is here in the East.  There is also a
White Scarf in the Outlands (arms level award).

One correction (I'm pretty sure) to your comments.  I don't believe that
the Sagittarius is an Order of High Merit (ie. Arms Level Award).  It seems
to me that both it and the Guardsman (sic) are non-armigerous.

Also, the term "Don" is still officially a protected title, equivalent to
Knight, according to the Laurel rulings of the time of Master Wilhelm von
Schleussel (whose name I've probably just butchered).  There is a current
appeal of the ruling pending at Laurel, but no new ruling has been
forthcoming.  That explains why the Dons of Fence in the East use the
formula, "Lord X of Y, Don of Fence."  It's a compromise.



Unto Rebecca Voris from Lady Orianna vander Delft;

After receiving the words to "Abuse" from my Lord Fridrikr, I refused to
publish them publicly here.  I am sending them directly to Rebecca.  They
can be found in the Caer Cinnuit Household songbook (the House of our Crown
Prince, Duke Sir Morguhn Sheridan) or from Lady Felemidh McDougall, who has
the rights to the song.  Fridrikr has written a much gentler version of
this song called SHEEP.  But that's for later.

Subject: On the History of Coloured Belts

In a recent posting (I think it was Digest #425, but don't quote me), Henry of
Maldon/Alex Clark was bemoaning the number of different coloured belts and their
customs.

I don't have the historical background to say anything about the tradition of
the giving of coloured belts (maybe Steffan could help me here?), but I've
always sort of heard the tradition that red belts are given to squires (a 
fairly common one) and that green belts are given to the apprentices of Laurels
and Pelicans.  I, for one, do not wear a green belt (it wouldn't go with my
purple garb); I figure that the ink stains on my fingers are sufficient evidence
of what I do with my spare time.

As far as I can tell, the custom probably arose to accord some notice to the
"squires" of other peers as well as to those of knights.  Doesn't matter to me;
some people are into it.

As for the formal taking of apprentices: I'm not sure if that's another one of
those semi-unspoken traditions that I'd always thought was true.  Again, it
seems to be parallel to the knights' taking of squires.  I also don't know of
anyone who calls him/herself an apprentice who isn't "squired" to a Peer, so
there may actually be some formal structure to that one.  This doesn't mean that
non-Peers can't teach.  Actually, lots of them do.

Can anyone out there who is older and wiser than I please give some background
on this?  Any idea when it came about?  Is there any formal basis for any of it?

Personally, I don't really care about the belt thing.  I just like to make
pretty letters.

Add 2 tablespoons of lactose per quart of diluted milk (adds body)
Add 1 tablespoon of brown sugar per quart (give the little yeasties some food)
Add 24 grains of yeast per quart (wild yeast is *not* your friend!)

Place in an EXPANDABLE container.  Kumiss fermenting produces lots of C0 .
									2

The temperature of the Kumiss should be kept above that of the minimum growth
temperature of the yeast, but below that of harmful bacteria.  I usually
check the temperature when I shake it (see below) and if it is too warm,
I put it in the 'fridge, and if it is too cool, remove it from the 'fridge.

SHAKE THE KUMISS FREQUENTLY!!!  I cannot emphasize this enough.  Kumiss needs
agitation at least 4 to 6 times daily.  Be sure and let the pressure off
each time you shake it.  I usually make kumiss in 2 quart batches in a plastic
milk jug.  It streches and it can be sealed.  You can make sparkling kumiss
in a champaigne bottle, but it is potentially hazardous (I had a 4 foot stream
of foamy milk shoot across the kitchen during a post-revel)

Depending on the ambient temperature, kumiss will take from 1 to 4 days to
make.  At Pennsic War, I made kumiss in under one day, leaving it in the
shade by day and keeping it inside by night.  The kumiss is at the peak of
freshness when you open the jug, and it foams up violently.  You have about
4 hours in which to drink it, before the taste begins to sour.

I usually use champaigne yeast, but I will try lager yeast for my next batch,
leaving it in the refrigerator the entire time (lager yeast works best right
above freezing and below 50 degrees)

Hope this recipe will inspire all of you to rush right out and ferment some
milk  (... OMINOUS SILENCE ...)  Oh well... enjoy.

I'll try, but I may have some of the information wrong -- in which case I would
appreciate being corrected.  Also, apologies if I'm telling you more than you
wish or need to know.

The main "legal tender" in this kind of archery is the standard 2-ft x 2-ft (I
think that's the size -- could someone please confirm?) paper target with
concentric circles that you can get at any archery shop.  (Tape it to a piece of
cardboard at afix the cardboard to something that'll stop arrows, such as bales
of hay, wood, heavy curtains.)  There are five concentric (2-inch?) rings on the
target.  Working in they are white, black, blue, red and gold (well, yellow),
and worth 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 points respectively.  (I.e. an arrow that hits the
outermost, white, ring scores 1 point and an arrow in the gold scores 5.)  You
get the benefit of the doubt:  If an arrow breaks the black line separating two
colours, you get the higher score.

The standard round is six arrows at a given distance, for a maximum score of 30.
 Two special cases:  An arrow that either passes all the way through the target
or hits it and bounces back out is assigned the average value of 3 points.  An
arrow that bounces out of the red or the gold will get the higher score if there
was a witness.  (At Pennsic, the usual practice is that the witness must have
been a marshall.)

The most common competitions are the royal round and the IKAC (Inter Kingdom
Archery Competition.)  The royal round consists of a round (of six arrows) at
forty yards, a round at 30 yards, a round at twenty yards, and a speed round (as
many arrows as you care to shoot, even if it's more than 6, in 30 seconds) at 20
yards.  You may start the speed round with an arrow ready to fly, but if it goes
off before the mark it doesn't count.  Arrows in the air at 30 seconds do count.
 There is some flexibility about what order to shoot the four rounds in.

(The highest score attainable in a royal round is 120.  Royal round scores are
the basis of rating archers in the East.  I don't know whether different
kingdoms handle this differently or whether this is standard across the SCA.
Your royal round average is the average of your top three royal round scores
from the previous twelve months -- with no more than one score allowed from any
one day's shooting.  The ratings are:

Archer:  30 point average.  Knows the basics, but still making lots of
elementary errors.  Almost all of the 30 points are being scored at 20 yards.

Bowman:  60 point average.  Has gotten rid of most of the basic errors and is
working on fine points of style.  Reliably scoring around 20 points at 20 yards
and around 15 points at each of 30 yards and 20-speed.  Rarely scoring much at
40 yards.

Master Bowman:  80 point average.  The difference between Bowman and Master
Bowman is a lot of *disciplined* practice.  Also, you won't make this level
unless you have a reasonably good bow (it doesn't have to cost a fortune, but if
you got your bow at a garage sale you're probably out of luck) and good matched
arrows.  (Again, it doesn't have to cost a fortune.  The arrows that were
selling at Pennsic for $18 (US) a dozen are fine; 50-cent K-Mart arrows are not.)

Grandmaster:  100 point average.  For archery fanatics.  The other ratings are
attainable by anyone who is willing to be sufficiently active and persistent
within an SCA context.  To reach this level, archery has to be much more of a
priority.

Okay, sorry for that digression.
The other major competition, is the IKAC.  It consists of *two* regular rounds
and *two* speed rounds at each of 40, 30 and 20 yards.  (Another way to think of
it is as a double royal round plus two two speed rounds at 30 yards and two
speed rounds at 40 yards.  It is generally permissible to extract a royal round
score from an IKAC as long as you don't pick and choose:  The first score at
each distance belongs to the first royal round and the second score at each
distance belongs to the second royal round and you can't mix and match.)

The IKAC must be shot all at once.  You can't shoot half of it, break for lunch,
then come back and finish.  You will, however, be allowed a practice round or
two at each distance to get the range.  Don't overdo the practice:  The IKAC is
something of an endurance shoot:  Not counting practice shots, yout are shooting
72 arrows without much rest.

There will be both royal round and IKAC competitions at Pennsic.  They are
individual competitions, not team competitions.  (For the actual war shoot, the
"team" scores are the sums of all the individual scores for the two sides.)
There will also be various just-for-fun novelty shoots, the details of which
should come out in a few months.

The actual Pennsic archery war point varies from year to year.  Two years ago,
there were two competitions.  The first was the charging target.  The standard
targets at 20, 30, and 40 yards were taken down and replaced by man-sized
pictures of a charging Viking.  To simulate the charge, you had 15 seconds to
shoot as many arrows as you liked.  During the first five seconds you could only
shoot at the 40-yard target, during the next five seconds you could only shoot
at the 30-yard target and during the last 5 seconds you could only shoot at the
20-yard target.  The average score for this was half a point (one point per
arrow in the target, no matter where), but people who had been practicing
earlier in the year could reliably get 2-3 points.  Last year, this war point
was modified to an actual moving target (man sized) which started at 70 yards
and was pulled in to a distance of 25 yards, with one point being awarded for
every arrow hitting the target before it stopped.  There were practical and
logistical problems with this, and this year will probably be more like the
charging Viking (though I've heard rumour that the longer distances will be
greater than 40 yards.)

(The non-advanced archer's strategy for doing well at the charging-viking shoot
is as follows:  Spend the 5-second countdown aiming at the 40-yard target.  At
"go", release the arrow and aim at 30.  You've got plenty of time.  At "switch
to 30" release your arrow and aim at 20.  80% of the points are scored at this
distance, and you want to do it right.  By aiming at this target while others
are shooting at the 30 you are giving yourself 10 full seconds to make two good
shots.  Release the first shot at the "switch to 20 command"  (actually, there
won't be such a command, just someone counting to fifteen) and take the last
five seconds to carefully aim and fire one last arrow at the 20.  Don't actually
stand holding the bow at a draw for more than 2-3 seconds at a time, or you'll
tire your arm; the five seconds per arrow is for everything.)

The second standard war point is the clout shoot.  You get a point for every
arrow you can drop into a 10-foot-radius circle (I *think* it's radius) in
thirty seconds.  Two years ago the circle (a low wall of hay bales, though for
practice a circle of red cloth will mostly do) was set at 100 yards, and the
average score on this competition was 1 point.  Last year it was set at 75
yards, and the average score on this competition was 2 points.  Word isn't out
yet on what it'll be this year.

Until details of the Pennsic competition are officially announced, you can get
90% of the practice you'll need by shooting at standard targets and periodically
shooting royal rounds and IKACs.  (I'd advise against shooting royal rounds at
every practice session, as you want to have some sessions devoted solely to
practice and drill and working on mistakes.)  Here are some semi-random comments
about practicing:

*Archery uses a set of muscles you probably don't use for any other purpose.  At
the beginning of the archery season, your archers will *not* be in shape to get
through an afternoon or evening of archery.  A good exercise, especially for
beginners, is to take a bow home and, each evening, slowly draw the bow to full
draw, hold it for about 5 seconds, and slowly release.  Do this about a dozen
times over the course of the evening.  (Not one after another!)  This doesn't
sound like much, but it will make a big difference.

*People tend to use bows that are too heavy.  There are advantages to using a
heavy bow, but for anyone who hasn't been shooting long enough not to need
advice, anything over 40 pounds is probably a mistake.  Twenty-five pounds is a
perfectly respectable weight (though many bows of that weight are difficult to
aim at anything over 30 yards) and many archers shouldn't ever go over thirty
pounds.

*The difference between the right arrows and the wrong ones is about 10 points
in a royal round.  You want arrows which match your bow weight (garbage arrows
tend to be splined for 40- or 50-pound bows) and which are not too long.  At
full draw, only the point should extend beyond the rest.  If the arrow is longer
it should be cut down (saw off the excess and glue a point onto the shorter
shaft) or replaced.

*You know the standard set of beginners' errors  (Stance, elbows, wrists,
incomplete draw, etc.).  Don't let some of these slide while working on others.
It's a real pain to pull everything together, but not nearly as bad as trying to
unlearn old habits.  In particular, don't *allow* people to shoot instinctively.
 It's a great way to get a decent score instead of a lousy one (especially at
short ranges) but it destroys the foundation which allows you to move from
decent to good.

*The trick with speed rounds, at least to start with, is not to shoot *any*
faster than the regular round.  (You can improve your time initially by not
wasting time between shots, but take just as much time on each shot.)  Four
arrows, shot normally, within 30 seconds, will net 2/3 the score of an untimed
round.  Six or seven arrows, shot hurriedly, will not do nearly as well.  Time
enough later to work on ways to build the number of arrows up to five or six or
more.  Also, there is a five-second warning, but don't aim and draw right away
-- your arm will be shaking by the end of the five seconds.  And you're too
likely to release early.   Draw and aim (or vice versa) around the two- or
three-second mark.

SCA-legal equipment:

Longbows, recurved bows and crossbows are all legal.  (Crossbows tend to be
accurate, but slow, and the advice given above was not given with crossbows in
mind.  They also give their bolts extremely flat trajectories:  shooting the
clout shoot with a crossbow is a nearly hopeless proposition.)  Compound bows
are not legal.

Arrows must have wooden shafts (not aluminum).  I believe (I'm not sure) that
they must be fletched with feathers rather than plastic.

Good luck.  I hope this helps.  If anyone has spotted any serious errors,
omissions or misstatements, please make it known rather than letting
unsuspecting archers loose with my bad advice!

Subject:  A reply to Arval and clarification (Cher)

Greetings!

Having just seen Arval's comments upon my remarks, I should like to both reply
and clarify.

First, I must say unto milord Arval:  I took no umbrage at your comments,
please take mine that follow in the same spirit; and sorry, but you're wrong.

Arval gave the following comments for the sake of discussion, and I quote them
now for reference purposes:

   >I have trouble seeing how this is relevent.  When this lady accepted
   >her office, it was IN FULL KNOWLEDGE that an "oath of fealty" would be
   >required.  How could she complain if that requirement were enforced.
   >The SCA is by (official) definition devoted to the recreation of
   >Medieval European culture, in which such requirements were universal.
   >I sympathize with Baronesses Wyvernwoode's problem, and I have seen
   >such problems arise before, but I cannot see how they can legally
   >effect the SCA.  After all: would I, as a Jew, have the right to take
   >the Catholic church to court because their practices violate my
   >beliefs?  I see this situation as analogous.


Arval, you have no way of knowing this, but at the time Baroness Wyvernwoode
was crowned, Trimaris law did *not* require an oath of fealty _per_se_.  The
law was later changed, putting Baroness Wyvernwoode (among others) in a nasty
bind.

More to the point is that *required* oaths, of fealty or anything else, create
what is legally known as a "discriminatory filter."  In other words, it
doesn't specifically state "No Jews (or blacks, Quakers, handicapped,
whatever) can hold this office unless they take this oath," but it creates a
situation in which such is essentially the case (or can be made to be the
case).  And, since this is a matter of mundane [il]legality and the SCA is a
non-profit organization (*very* germaine to the issue), our devotion to a
culture where such oaths were common is over-ridden.

Or, looking at it from a slightly different angle:  *why* should Baroness
Wyvernwoode have been faced with this situation at all?  Why should *any*
gentle be faced with a choice between filling an office in a volunteer
organization and their religious conscience?  Is this right?  What about the
potential for coercion in such a situation (very, very real, I assure you!)?
Why permit *anyone* to excluded from serving in any capacity for any reason?
If this is a game, and our hobby, should such a situation be tolerated?  Or
pointed out as wrong?

Lastly:  it is fairly obvious that a Jew couldn't take the Catholic Church to
court simply because the Catholic religious beliefs and practices differ.
*HOWEVER*:  a Jew _could_ take someone of another religious persuasion to
court if there were an attempt at coercing the Jew into converting, joining
in, whatever.  Also, it there were some attempt to interfere with the Jew's
civil rights in some manner, such as denial of employment on the basis of
religion or an attempt to get one dismissed from current employment on the
same basis.

I think it important to point out that the ramifications of *required* oaths in
the Society are almost entirely negative, and potentially dangerous to the
Society's existence.  This is why I feel so very strongly that all such
Kingdom laws should be eliminated.

I thank one and all for reading this.

Subject:  Peerage; fencers

Greetings!

I've been following the dicussions on "life after peerage" and fencers/archers
with interest.  I hope what I am about to add won't be redundant.

There has been a lot of excellent commentary about the qualities looked for in
a peer, and the responsibilities of the peerage.  To these I would add that in
my view, many of the higher awards, *especially* the peerage, come as
recognition of a status one has already achieved.  In other words, the gentle
in question has been looked upon and treated as a peer by his/her fellows for
some time *before* actual elevation to the peerage.  Those chosen are those
who (hopefully) have worked endlessly and tirelessly for the sheer love of it,
and who behave in a peer-like manner besides (I refuse to try to define "peer-
like behavior; that's a powder keg in itself!:-) ).  Not being elevated
wouldn't change a damn thing for these gentles.  It has been said down here
that a "proper" response to elevation is something like, "Now I can *really*
get something accomplished!"

I think I can safely say that it is also the prevailing viewpoint down here
that the surest way to avoid getting any award is to make that award one's
goal.  In other words, the "merit badge syndrome" is watched-for and frowned-
upon.

To those who are not of the peerage, especially the newer folk, I would say
"please do us all a favor and *don't* succomb to 'peer fear'".  The peers are
there to help.  Becoming a peer does not make an individual instantaneously
unapproachable!  We are here to serve the Society, the Kingdom, and *you*!  If
there is one Society "disease" I hate, it's "Peer Fear."

An anecdote comes to mind:  Master Taliesynne, the Principal Pelican of
Trimaris, was once serving at a feast.  A lady whom he was serving said, "Why,
Master Taly!  A *peer*, serving?"  To which Master Taly is said to have
replied, "But, my lady, what are peers *for*?"

As a note of interest for the other peers on the Rialto:  the Trimaris
Pelicanate has decided on periods of contemplation for those about to be
elevated to the Order, not unlike a knight candidate's vigil.  This, we know,
is the custom of both the Pelicanate and the Laurelate in a number of
Kingdoms.  We felt it to be a good thing to give the candidate a chance to
adjust, to talk to us and ask questions about their new position and
responsibilities, and to back out without embarrasment or dishonor if they
feel themselves unready.

About later recognition for those who are already peers:  as has been pointed
out, saying "thank you" is *always* appreciated.  Arval's comments on this
subject were especially astute (my compliments, Arval!).  Though, in the case of
those who come to a Kingdom already a peer, I think the recognition of service
in the form of awards can be thoroughly appropriate and very gratifying.  Let
me illustrate:  Duc Merowald de Sylveastan had been a Companion of the Laurel
longer than Trimaris had existed when he moved here.  As a result, many
thought that a Trimarian Arts/Sci award would hold no meaning from him. No one
who saw His Grace's face the night he received the Order of the Silver Trident
could think that.  He was obviously tickled pink that Trimaris thought enough
to say "Attaboy!" for what he has given to us.

About fencers, etc.:  there is no doubt that this is another sticky, touchy
issue.  Resolution will not come quickly or easily.  But it must be realized
that these gentles should not be allowed to slip through the cracks; they too
serve and should be recognized accordingly.  Frankly, since fencing is a period
form of combat, I think something ought to be worked out recognizing it as a
viable Society martial art.  Fencing tournaments *are* conceivable, after all.
And no doubt many fencers display those other qualities to be sought in a
Peer of the Realm.  Thus, I don't think knighthood should be immediately ruled
out:  let's think about it, okay?

Archers are a much tougher situation to deal with, and I freely admit I know
not what to think.  I fervently hope someone has a bright idea out there...

One last thing:  when are we gonna talk about the Laurel Queen's recent
survey/propositions?

Message-Id: <10685@well.UUCP>


	The reason that the King & BoD banned Faerie & magical personas
circa 1970-72 was the large intersection of the membership of the SCA and
the Neo-Pagan movement in California.
	While pagans and magic didn't much bother us miscellaneous christians
and catholics, it _did_ powerfully offend the sensibilities of the "rationalist
humanists", and while they had to put up with us, since we were in period,
magic had to go.
	Interestingly enough, convinced christians weren't much worried about
the possibility of magic being used unfairly in battle, but the "nonbelievers"
were -- sic transit gloria incredulity!

Subject: Estrella and departure

I am sad to say that with my leaving my current job, I will be leaving
the Rialto for a while.  It has been a great deal of fun, and I will
probably get occasional printouts.  For those who still wish to
correspond by slower means, I am at 3550 Alden Way #5, San Jose, CA
95117.  (408) 244-2582 [dial big-club].  I am still interested in
discussing fighting, scribing, brewing, and lots of etcetera!

I will, however, be at Estrella, in a rectangular red and yellow
pavilion.  I have a white hammock that looks netlike, and will hang
this on one corner.  That is your invitation to come and say hi.  We
will be having a party (i hope) on Sunday night, so please come
introduce yourselves.  I usually wear red or red and yellow.  5'5", 130,

Subject: Lochac info request

Greetings once more, good gentles.  Does anyone know anything about Lochac?

A good friend of mine from Caid is planning to spend two months in Australia
(Lochac) this summer.  She would like to know where the most active SCA
groups are.  Also, she would appreciate info about cost of living (e.g. 
housing).  It would be ideal to get those two kinds of info by Friday,
when her grant proposal is due.

Also, she'd appreciate names, phone numbers, addresses for SCA people
to use as contact points for the SCA Down Under.

Thanks for your help!

From: MALICE@ISIS.MIT.EDU

An experiment was tried at the last event in our area:  Members of the 
incipient story tellers guild came into the kitchen after the feast and told 
stories (as they dryed dishes) while people cleened up.  It was rather nice 
and i hope they do it again.  It made us feel like someone was actually 
thinking about the cleen up crew and trying to make out lives easier.  Also we 
got a *lot* of workers in the first shift and cleaned the serving bowls in 
reccord time.
On the  other hand the dead dog shift- the last one when every one is tired, 
there's nothing left to clean but the really filthy pots that have been soaking 
for the past two hours, and there are only four people left in the kitchen is 
just plain no fun no matter how interesting the stories.
Does anyone out there have kitchen experiences to share?  Songs with rousing 
choruses (sea chanties are *great*, but all the ones we know are o.o.p.)  I 
work in the kitchen because its fun (no, really), but any ideas you'all have 
that would make it more fun would be greatly apreciated...

other subjects:
re cavalier quibble:  You can certainly call yourself a cavalier and mean that 
you are a horseman, but when I say "cavalier" i mean a person who buckles 
swash, fights rapeir and wears a feather in his/her hat and (if a woman) has 
one of the most hidious hairstyles ever foisted on the human race in the name 
of fashion, and so, i suspect, does almost everyone else.  You can also call 
yourself a villan and mean that you're just simple country folk, but if you 
don't make that clear, people will get an entirely different idea...

re women who fight:  They show up from time to time in popular litterature... 
collections of stories, lives of saints, etc... usually having disguised 
themselves as men.  As long as we're trying to recreate the age of chivalry, 
and not actual medieval fighting conditions, i say go for it.  Woman fighters 
(i'm b.s. ing now, and couldn't give you any refs.) are i think even more 
popular in eastern romance, and i think that this is because eastern fighters 
tended to be (relatively) lightly armored, highly mobile horesmen/archers 
(requireing more skill than strength) while western fighters were heavly 
armored (requireing not only strength, but very expensive equipment) and did 
not shoot from horseback.

Message-Id: <2313@canisius.UUCP>

I've been off the net due to the flu for a couple of weeks so rather than
post a lot of short articles, I'm posting one list of assorted comments.

Re : Weapon Laws ( New York State ) and finding them.    
	I went to the main branch of the public library, walked into the Law
	and Government branch and found what I was looking for in less than
	two minutes.  (I must have done something wrong. ;-) )  I'm posting
	my results in a separate article that follows.  It's in a form suitable
	for publishing in local newsletters if anyone wishes.  If anyone does
	publish it, please send me a copy.  I found nothing to indicate that
	martial artists have to register their hands with the police department.
	( I think it's a good idea.  Just be sure to report it if they're 
	stolen.  That way, the police won't be after you if they're used to
	kill someone. :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) )

> Who's going to tell Cariadoc he doesn't exist?  Not me!  - Eric
( From a discussion of Eur. vs Non-Eur. personas )
	Nor will anyone else have to either.  Cariadoc of the Bow's well
	developed ( and well researched ! ) persona is that of a Andalusian
	Moslem, what Dagonell would call a "Spanish Moor".  Can you say
	"Western Europe", boys and girls?

Re : Awards for Scouts.  Knighthood ???
	No, no, no.  I am against an award for scouting.  Scouting is currently
	the only major activity (emphasis on active) I'm involved in where
	I don't have to deal with people whose main "interest" in the activity
	is "getting the merit badge"!  Nobody's in it for the badge, the rank,
	the status, etc.  I'd rather keep it that way.  If you think someone
	is a truly wonderful scout, recommend them for an AoA, a local service
	award, etc. or better still, simply tell them!  

	And while I'm on the soapbox about awards and scouting.  I strongly
	dislike the scouts who paint laurel wreaths on their helms so everyone
	will address them by their proper title.  The Pennsic woods aren't
	high court.  When I assign a scout to a fighting unit, I expect that
	scout to answer to "Hey you".

Re : Ice Dragon, the A&S pentathlon.
	We're looking for a few more judges.  If anyone has an address for
any of the following individuals, we'd appreciate it.

     IN PUBLIC PLACES; SEARCH FOR WEAPONS

     1.) In addition to  the  authority  pro-
     vided  by  this  article  for  making an
     arrest without a warrant, a police  off-
     icer may stop a person in a public place
     located within the geographical area  of
     such  officer's  employment when he rea-
     sonably suspects  that  such  person  is
     committing, has committed or is about to
     commit either (a) a felony or (b) a mis-
     demeanor  defined  in the penal law, and
     may demand of him his name, address  and
     an explanation of his conduct.

     circumstances prescribed in subdivisions

     injury,  he may search such person for a
     deadly weapon or any instrument, article
     or  substance readily capable of causing
     serious physical injury and  of  a  sort
     not  ordinarily carried in public places
     by law-abiding  persons.   If  he  finds
     such  a weapon or instrument, or any ot-
     her property or possession of  which  he  
     reasonably  believes  may constitute the 
     commission of a crime, he  may  take  it 
     and  keep it until the completion of the 
     questioning,  at  which  time  he  shall 
     either return it, if lawfully possessed,  
     or arrest such person.

     These laws are in the public domain  and
     no   permission   is   needed   to  copy
     them.   -Dagonell

	Agreed!!!  After that momentary shudder ("Oh my god!, Thorkel just
went down!  That means I'm the last one on this side of the bridge.")
there comes an adrenalin calm, and with a blood curdling scream you 
launch yourself at the foe's shieldwall...

	And get pummled into hamburger, hopefully taking one or two of
them with you.  Ah, those were the days...

	It also works in ship battles, when you need some people to
break the opposing shieldwall.  The nice thing about being a berserk,
if you live, you're a hero, and if you die, you get to sit down and
have a cool drink and watch the rest of the fight. :-)

Subject: Roots and Perspective (responses)

The announcement for the first SCA event (party) reads as such
(asterisks are mine):

***************************************************************

Be it known to all who may be lovers of Chivalry that there will be
held on the first of May 12:00 to 6:00 P.M. an International
Tournament - for that it is Spring

All knights are summonded to defend in single combat the claims of
their ladies to the title of "fairest", signified by the crown which
will be awarded to him who the Judges deem fights most bravely.  And
for the increase of joy to both them who fight and they who watch,
there will be both singing, and dance.

(Please reply:)
2219 Oregon St.
Berkeley, Calif.
845-4340

All guests are encouraged to wear the dress of some age of
Christendom, Outre-Mer, or Faerie, in which swords were used.

***************************************************************

The calligraphy ain't so good and the text is pushed around a little
bit differently on the page, but the above is a complete, acurate
wording.  There is also a picture of a sword, entwined in some sort
of flowering vine.

As to comments:

Lord Harabanar --
	Christendom does not just include Europe, but (I would think)
any Christian Land.  Byzantium was Christian....
	Outre-Mer was used in the time of the Crusades to refer to the
crusader states.  But we are not limiting ourselves to the time of the
Crusades.  To the medieval mind many lands were "over the sea".  To
your average villager who has sporadic contact with traders most lands
are "over the sea": Greece, Turkey, India, China, Japan.  It all looks
the same from one spot (especially if you don't have a globe in your
hovel to check a place name against).

David le casse':
	Of course the use of "Faerie" implies supernatural beings
(unless you consider the work of Margret Murry) and the BoD has ruled
on supernatural things.  BoD rulings, however, do not effect ingrained
societal tradition.  Some Kingdoms have many upstanding citizens that
have Elvish personea.  When I joined one of the first people I met was
a persona of a human who "thought" she was an Elvish Princess.  Talk
about wierd!  The original party did, I believe, include someone in a
"Neptune (trident, sea-weed)" costume.  The SCA has changed but one
cannot ignore where we have come from.

Thank you both for your comments.

Other interesting notes:
	Notice, please, that there is no place named on the invitation
-- but "the dress of some age of Christendom...." is specified.
	At this first tournament there was fencing.  You can see it on
the home movie that someone took at the party.  Some of the first
rhino-hiding too.

Anyone else?

     And I have read that the current usage of "marshal" comes from the
father of William Marshal, who started out as a (guess what) keeper of
the horses (mares?)!  Knights like to "horse around," don't they? ;-)
     Personally, I think "warder" sounds better.

     What the hell?????????????  Is there actually a rule somewhere that

     I'm beginning to have nightmares in which all the unofficial belt-
color distinctions become official, and I'm stuck with pink polyester
because it's the only kind of belt that isn't reserved. ;-)
     Actually, the only one of those customs that is anything more than a
custom is white belts for knights, which is something I think I can live
with.  In fact, the only squire with whom I'm personally acquainted wears
a *blue* belt.  Now let's be careful that we don't add any unnecessary
new rules to the ones we've already got.

>MEDIEVAL PARSLEY BREAD                 Servings:

     This recipe, or another with the same name, showed up on rec.food.
cooking about a month ago.  It is no longer available at PSUVM, but the
person who posted it seems to put the word "servings," with or without a
number, at the top of all recipes, so I suspect that is where it came from.
     It started out as "parsley bread" in _Fabulous_Feasts_ by Madeleine
Pelner Cosman, and, aside from the omission of the currants in her recipe,
the use of only a yolk and not a whole egg on the crust, and the change of
some proportions, it remains about the same as her recipe.  Unfortunately,
as is the case with most of the other recipes in her book, her source for
this recipe is neither cited nor quoted.  Some, at least, of her recipes
can be found in period sources, but, even if it were safe to assume that
all of her recipes are from period sources, it isn't possible to judge the
reliability of her interpretation until you've identified her source.  This
recipe is probably okay for something to eat, but I know of no reason to
believe that it is "Medieval."

     Now for the question: I have often heard it said in the SCA that in
the middle ages, bread was frequently/usually served with honey butter.
This is also standard practice in many SCA groups.  I don't believe that I
have ever seen any actual documentation for this custom.  Can anyone tell
me whether such documentation exists, and where it may be found?

The way it was explained to me, Faeries, Elves, etc weren't exactly banned, you
just had to prove you had any powers you laid claim to .. if your persona was an

Subject: guns

Unto the fisher folk of the net and Marcus Buddereich Der Visiger, greetings.
I wish I could respond directly to you, but most of my email gets eaten by
etherial gremlins. Your recent postings requested information on replica
firearms. As my father was a master gunsmith and collector of antique
firearms, including numerous period pieces, I may have some information of
value to you. 
        First, I have never seen or heard of a matchlock pistol. While they
may have existed, it seems an extraordinarily ineffective and dangerous
weapon. Pistols seem to have had two primary uses in our period. One was for
self defense, especially by older nobles, ladies, and those not so good at
swordplay, and the other was for use by cavalry, who seem to have used the
other hand for a sword. Of course, the use of such weapons by highwaymen and
brigands followed immediately.
        The wheelock was the first arm that made this kind of usage possible,
as they could be stored for some time, and be readied to fire at a moment`s
notice. Your period,(early to middle 16th century) saw the development of two
types of proto-flintlocks, the snaphaunce and miquelet, both of which were
used primarily as pistols. While the true flintlock is really too late for
your use, either of these would suit your needs. I think fairly advanced
metal-working techniques could convert a replica flintlock to one of these
designs.
        Regarding finding a replica wheelock, you may find such advertised in
the back of shootist magazines (Guns and Ammo,Field and Stream, Handgun,etc.)
You are right that the non-functioning version would be much cheaper,
particularly because wheelocks contain *many* hand fitted moving parts, and
are internally quite complex.
        All of these present-day replicas seem to be made in Italy, so there
may be some help for you from somebody in Drachenvald (Anybody out there?)
Finally, you should check for society restrictions on handguns. I`m not
certain, but it seems to me that there is a society-wide ban on handguns, real
or replica, as it seems that one was discharged at an event one time, and the
roof of a church was damaged. Does anybody know the facts on this?

Subject: knighthood,etc.

Unto the fisher-folk of the net, greetings from Li Kung Lo! I have been
following the discussions of Arval, Donal Artur, Michael of York and others
regarding the meaning of chivalry in the society, and I`m just pleased that we
seem to have found a new expired steed to pummel! Anyway, to shorten this
missive, I will admit that I think that this is an issue like the mideast war,
where all the solutions are unacceptable to somebody. I`m undecided, but these
are my thoughts on the subject:
[1] While KSCA/MSCA is a society-wide award, there seems to be considerable
variance in the criteria used by various kingdoms in awarding it. In some
quarters, knighthood seems to be granted solely for excellence at arms, or
even for simply winning a crown tourney. In others, courtly graces, service,
and courtesy seem to have a greater influence. I have even heard references to
"fighting knights" as opposed to "artsy knights", and we seem to have a
rapidly accelerating divergence of criteria. I, for one, would rather see
knighthood awarded to a chivalrous but mediocre warrior, an archer or fencer,
than to an arrogant tyrant noted only for winning a lot of tourneys.

[2] Fencing is a new art form in the society, and is limited both by the BOD
and certain kingdoms. I think we will have to decide whether it is an
appropriate activity at all before we decide whether to reward it. Moreover,
even if the rank-and-file of the SCA accepts it, we have *darn little* control
over the BOD, and that is certainly a separate issue.Here again, there is
considerable divergence between the various kingdoms.

        Recently a mailing was sent by the crown of the East to applicants for
entry in crown tourney, apparently to make sure they were aware of the
responsibilities involved, should they win. After many reasonable questions
concerning protocol, a short essay question was appended. As I do not have a
copy with me, I will have to paraphrase; I apologize if I misconstrue the
question`s meaning:
        Lord So-and-So is an OK guy. He has been in the SCA for a very long
time. While he is always willing to help out and is well loved by the people,
he has not distinguished himself by any specific service that might make him a
suitable candidate for the pelican. He is not an expert in any of the arts,
although he has a basic working knowledge of most of them. He is not a
fighter, and it seems probable that he never will be. However, he is the
finest archer in the society, with the highest IKAC scores ever recorded! It
doesn`t seem that he has researched this historically, and has been unable to
spend much time teaching, largely due to mundane responsibilities. How are you
going to make this man a peer?
        At least one knight (send the check, and I`ll name him) responded-
"Marry him to a mean, tough lady, and send him to Drachenvald!" Oh well...

[3] While I think it would be very appropriate to recognize martial artists
with a laurel, or to reward teaching these arts with recognition as a pelican,
there is a long-standing pattern of this *not* happening, and I agree with
Arval that to expect this is not realistic. Until the status of the
"peripheral" arts of fencing and archery change, I think that the best we can
do is to reward the activities of those practicing these arts as we do now, at
the Kingdom level, at least in those Kingdoms where these arts are recognized
at all.
        Finally, I`ll make you a deal- if you support my right to be Chinese,
I`ll support your right to be a cavalier...

Subject: "Is there life after peerage?"

Siobhan of Northwoods:
 
Elizabeth Braidwood's original posting hit very strongly, and I
wanted to respond with some thoughts, some directly connected and
some not.
 
One is that we have a lady in our Barony, Duchess Caellyn, who has
every award the Middle can give, except for a Knighthood. This lady
has been very active for over 17 years, and while she's had her more
and less active periods, has been reliably involved in many aspects
of our Barony;s life. She was wistfully heard to say at one point
that she could never be surprised in court again, because there were
no awards left to be given her. (I don't think this meant she does
what she does because of danglies, but a real feeling of loss about
being surprised in court. I hope this difference makes sense to
someone other than me....)
 
At any rate, at a local event last weekend, TRM Reynard and
Brynhildr gave the Duchess the award of the Doe's Grace (formerly
called the Queen's Grace) which is a "we really appreciate you"
award. Caellyn was very surprised, and we were all very pleased. I
was thrilled that our King and Queen wanted, as I have, a public way
to say "thank you" to someone who contributes much to our lives.
(And, Arval, your recent suggestions make much sense to me. I plan
to pass them on...)
 
As for peers themselves and how they feel -- I got my Pelican in
October. While I can't honestly say that the thought of being a peer
was totally absent from my mind, (in Northwoods we are surrounded by
peers, and it seems natural to me that people who work and do well
get rewarded -- and I know that's a much different reality than for
many people in many Kingdoms..), I had come to grips with my
feelings about peerage or the lack of it some time before, and
decided that what I really liked doing, I was doing for the pleasure
of doing it and for what good it did for the Society. If it was good
enough for a peerage, well, that was fine, but if it wasn't, well,
that was OK too. (I know how self-serving that's going to sound, but
it's true. I'd had my share of "peer fever" and come through it, and
know how rabid that can get, too.)
 
At any rate, at the time that they gave me my Pelican, I was heading
into a real energy slump. I was just coming out of the first 20
weeks of pregnancy, which had been filled with constant
morning,noon,and night-sickness, and I had been spending a lot of
time feeling that I wasn't really doing my job as Soc. Chronicler to
the best of my ability. And here they give me this award! Ack! Talk
about feeling guilty!
 
For me, the award has been a constant reminder that I need to be
doing my best all the time. That the award wasn't given to let me
rest on my Laurels, but as the beginning of a time of more service.
It's been tough to live up to the standards I think it requires. It
's been hard, when I have been feeling large and pregnant and
grumpy, to remember that people are looking up to me for a role
model, and that I have to try and be as chivalrous as possible,
especially when I'm not feeling that way.
 
And you know what? I think it's been useful. Having that goal for me
has helped me climb out of some outrageous pits of self-pity and bad
feeling, and try to go beyond my feelings and my problems to reach
out. Having something to concentrate on other than me has been
life-saver these past few months.
 
But I still feel guilty from the work I haven't been getting done. O
dangly, thy True name is "cattle prod"!!!!

These notices will be appearing in the MArch and APril Kingdom Newsletters.
Please also distribute them to your local groups, newsletters, etc.
 
Unto the Members of the Society. The Ombudsman for the Marshallate
sends greetings.
 
As you are all aware, the Fall Tournaments Illuminated was mailed to
the membership far later than was desired. In that issue, there was
a call for comment for the proposed revision to the rules of the
List. Because of the lateness of arrival, and the closeness to the
announced deadline for comment, not enough time was allowed for the
membership to respond.
 
The Board of Directors, with the support of the Society Marshal,
wishes to solicit additional comment on the proposed revisions to
the Rules of the List. Deadline for comments will be 4/11/89. Please
send your comments to the Society Marshal and to the Marshallate
Ombudsman.
 
In Service to the Marshallate and to the Society.

  *****************************************************
     From the Corporate Minister of Arts and Sciences
 
In announcing recently that he would not run for another term as
Governor of Massachusetts, Michael Dukakis said that as the end of
each term in office approaches the holder of that office must
consider whether it is time to step aside to let someone else take
up the mantle of responsibility. While this may be a bit
pompous-sounding when referring to an SCA office it still applies.
 
As of this fall, when my current term is up, I will have served for
six years as SCA Minister of Arts/Sciences. I think that should be
enough, hmmm. So ...
 
Now for a limited time only, you too have a change to be the
Society's next Corporate Minister of Arts & Sciences. Here's all you
have to do: just write a letter explaining why you think you'd be a
great A&S Officer, in as many words as covers the subject. Please
include your SCA resume (Offices held previously, awards (if any),
references, etc.) your view of the Arts & Sciences, plans for the
office, anything else that you feel qualifies you to hold this
office.
 
But wait, there's more! Well, actually, there isn't, but I've always
wanted to say that.
 
Then send copies of this package both to me and to the Board of
Directors of the SCA, Inc.
 
It is hoped that the final decision concerning this matter will be
made at this summer's BOD meeting so that a smooth transition
between my successor and me can be made. Please respond quickly so
that an informed, unrushed decision can be made.

Quibble back on again.  Cavaliers are only out of period as a faction in
the English Civil War.  Otherwise, they are *very* period, because
"cavalier" is another word for knight.  Quibble off again.

Please remember in this context--"Squire" is not an SCA title, but only a
reference.  There is nothing in the defining documents that creates any sort
of fighting or non-fighting apprentice class.  Figure out how to say some

I had heard rumors of an organization called "The Society for Creative
Anachronism" for a couple of years (but *nothing* about the organization
itself) when I mentioned interest to a friend living in the same dorm
complex.  This was in early 1970.  My friend was went regularly to meetings
of the Elves, Gnomes, and Little Men's Science Fiction, Chowder and
Marching Society.  I went along sporadically.  He heard that the SCA
was having an event in Tilden Park, so I turned the collar under on a
shirt, wore a serape I was using as a bedspread and grabbed a couple
of drop spindles and some wool and went.

While standing totally bewildered--and spinning (it seemed an appropriate
activity)--at a corner of the field, a Lady came up, looked at me, and
"You've just got to meet Dorothy" and rushed off.  She soon returned with
another young lady, who--it turned out--was trying to get a Spinner's
Guild off the ground and was very short of people who were interested,
let alone who knew how already.  I loaned her one of my spindles and we
stood there and talked.  At that time membership was determined primarily
by attendence--if you showed up for events, you were a member.  Therefore,
I became a member.

The event--as I found out--was March Crown in the Kingdom of the West
(One of 3 kingdoms at the time).

Perhaps a new order?  I don't know what the name would be, but it would
be centered on .. er .. physical skills?  Martial arts is one such skill,
but do belly dancing or other performing arts fall under the order of
the Laurel?  (I'm not certain ..)

Arnoff Ragnarsson recently pointed out the backgrounds for the "Last 
Tournament" event. He sais that Duke Siegfrieds invitation expected people
to dress up in garb from "Christendom, Outremer or the lands of Faeries". 

From this he draws the conclusion (correct me if I misunderstood you,
Master Arnoff) that basically everyone with medieval or fantasy garb was
welcome. As far as I understood that conclusion is drawn from the following
semantics:
	Christendom = Europe
	Outremer = Rest of the world
	Land of Faeries = Fantasy environments

Ill agree and on the first and last meaning (although "Christendom = Europe"
is a little shaky), but Outremer literally means "The lands beyond the sea" in
medieval french and the common usage in the middle ages meant only the lands
of the crusader states. (No I dont speak medieval french, but Ive picked up
the use of "outremer" from several books on the crusades). To now for certain
what Duke Sigfried meant, though, I guess you have to ask him.

By the way, this is not an argument in favor of keeping non-europeans out of 
the SCA. My feelings goes more in the lines of Michael Litchfields opinions 
(Bluntly put: Whatever you think, there here and cant be thrown out.) I 
personally encourage new members to take up oriental personas, if they feel
more at home with it.

     I once came across a picture from early 16th century England (I think)
of a man wearing shoes which looked almost exactly like plain Chinese
slippers.  They also look kind of similar to something that was worn in the
12th-13th centuries, although the latter type of shoe tended to have short,
but pointed, toes.  Anyway, the things are about as good as much of the

although I'd rather have something more substantial (for the last two years
or so I've been planning to make a pair of boots "sometime soon" ;-) ).

Good gentles!

This is probably a good time to point something out:  The titles Don
and Donna, used in several Kingdoms for fencers, should NOT be so
used.  The titles are the official Spanish equivalents of Sir, and as
such are reserves to the Chivalry.  This definition was made by the
Laurel King of Arms at least 7 years ago, and is in accordance with
Corpora, which has always prohibited landed titles being used in such
unofficial ways.

Thus, the use of these titles by fencers is exactly equivalent to some
gentle appropriating the title "Sir" for his own use without right.  I
strongly recommend that the title not be used.  No one but a Knight
should be addressed or referred to as "Don Soandso" or "Donna Soandsa".

The current Laurel Queen of Arms is considering a recommendation to
re-define these titles to be AoA level titles, i.e., equivalent to
Lord and Lady.  However, no such ruling has been made.  In the
interim, the "guild" of fencers of the East uses the term "don of
Fence" for their highest rank.  This term is placed after the name,
just as "Master Brewer" would be for a member of a brewing guild.

Not wanting to continue beating on a dead horse so I'll keep this
strictly to one thing ...

The Lands of Faerie would certainly include magical beings and performances
of magic would it not?  But the BoD a long time ago ruled out magic, magical
beings, and even put in the name rules a paragraph saying you cannot register
a name which suggested supernatural powers.  Possibly the original party
included some people claiming magical powers, it would certainly have
been a popular sort of thing to have a Merlin or Gandalf show up ...

The point I'm making is that the terms of the original party have been
changed by BoD ruling.  In hindsight I think it was a good thing too,
to avoid or silence the people who call us an Evil Cult.  But still, the
terms of that party don't hold any longer.

I promised to keep it to one thing .. so I'll say only one more thing.

Message-Id: <70788ABC102@PSUVM>


     The whole discussion of non-European personae seems a bit silly to me.
Especially since it looks like very few people have stopped to consider the
definition of "non-European."  European personae include Moors (in Spain
from 711 to 1492, although I only use the name "Spain" for convenience),
Turks (in the Balkan Peninsula, 15th and 16th centuries), Mongols (mainly
in the areas now known as the Ukraine and Hungary, 13th and 14th centuries)
and Chinese and other Asians (they came in with the Mongols).  The only
general groups of peoples who (to the best of my knowledge) don't seem to
have taken up residence in some part of Medieval/Renaissance Europe, in
communities of their own respective ethnic types, are sub-Saharan Africans,
Indians, Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans.  Before people say things
like "visitors," they ought to think first in terms of "immigrants," and
even "natives!"  (The natives are getting restless... ;-) )
     However, I don't see any reason why most of the "non-European"
Europeans can't wear local fashions if a particular event is announced
as being intended to re-create a specific region or culture.  Of course,
this sort of thing should only apply to single events, and it would apply
equally to personae of different ethnic groups, regions, and periods.
And, of course, the appropriate type of costume has to be available, and
most of us don't have costumes for every possible region and period.

Greetings to the Knowne World,

  The SCA newgroup certainly has grown since I was on it 9 months ago.  I'm
glad to see that we have access to almost instantaneous exchange of information
for the betterment of the Society.  I've seen different references to "SCA
Digests".  Are these digests of previous messages & if so, how can I get them?

  I have a basic idea for a contest & I'd like to see if any you can help me
flesh it out.  My idea is a "Squire Pentathalon".  Any squire would be eligible & the events would be things a squire would stereotypically do for their
knight, ie polishing boots, helping him/her with armor, etc.  Unfortunately,
those two situations wouldn't lend themselves to well to a contest.  I'd like
to have some sort of obsticle course where the squires have to run the gamut of
squirely hazards.  If you have any ideas of events that would be suitable,
please let me know.

                           In Service to the Society &

Subject: trolls liketh me not

Having read the original posting on the subject of Gate Guardian as opposed to
Troll as a delineator for the
person-in-charge-of-making-sure-that-you-are-checked-into-the-Hall-and-have
paid-your-money-and-know-where-the-changing-rooms-are, and having had a bit of
experience with this post, as well as being exactly that person for the next
two Carolingian events, I decided that I approved of the idea, and would try it
out,  However, Gare Guardian seemed cumbersome and not quite right,

Accordingly, I am submitting as a replacement "Gate Keeper", and will be
referring to myself or anyone working in that capacity for me as such.  Anyone
who persists in calling me the "Troll" will be politely, tactfully, and firmly
corrected, and anyone who makes silly Ghostbusters jokes (except my wife, she
can get away with much) will politely, tactfully, and firmly have their head
bitten off.

As far as the aspects of courtesy raised about Gate Keepers and their
victims(?), there can be problems here.  It should be remembered that
everybody comes to their FIRST event once, and the Gate Keeper is the first
person they have to deal with, perhaps the first ever "official" of the SCA. 
The Gate Keeper should therefore be not only courteous and caring, but
efficient.  To aid in this, I have a couple of suggestions.

1)  Get with the Autocrat beforehand.  Find out how much money he/she expects
to change hands at the door, and in what form, so as to have the proper
change.
2)  Impress upon the Autocrat (or deputy in charge of reservation lists) that
the last thing that should be done before leaving for the site is to have the
most complete list possible of who is coming.  This, in my experience, should
come in two forms, one sorted by SCA name, and one by mundane last name.  Not
everyone has an SCA name, everyone that I've ever met has a mundane name. 
Most people in my experience don't feel that they are at an event until after
they are out of the changing rooms, so asking for the mundane name shouldn't
bother people.
3)  Have and understand a policy concerning who makes decisions regarding
problems like an unreceived reservation, a substitution of persons, a refund
request, etc.  Most times, I refer these to the Autocrat.  But the objective
should be to get the most people by the Gate Keeper in the shortest time with
as little fuss as possible.
4)  Finally (or maybe not if I think of anything else), make sure that your
Gate Keepers understand their role(s).  They are Treasurers, cashiers, Public
Relations experts, Accountants, and Information booth all rolled into one. 
Pen and paper are essential, they should know where various places in the hall
are, and they *must* be polite.  They are often the only stationary people in
the hall.

I apologize for the length of this posting, and any spelling, grammer,
punctuation, and other errors except philosophical ones.

Good my lady,

I must complement you in general on your excellent discussion of
discrimination as it realte to the SCA.  However, I must question one
matter you address:

> The area which the Society need most concern itself with respect to potential

The following paragraph is merely for the sake of discussion.  Please
don't take it too seriously.

I have trouble seeing how this is relevent.  When this lady accepted
her office, it was IN FULL KNOWLEDGE that an "oath of fealty" would be
required.  How could she complain if that requirement were enforced.
The SCA is by (official) definition devoted to the recreation of
Medieval European culture, in which such requirements were universal.
I sympathize with Baronesses Wyvernwoode's problem, and I have seen
such problems arise before, but I cannot see how they can legally
effect the SCA.  After all: would I, as a Jew, have the right to take
the Catholic church to court because their practices violate my
beliefs?  I see this situation as analogous.

On the other hand, your point is well taken:  It is the case that such
problems arise, and those of us who frame laws should take heed, and
avoid building in such traps.

Subject: Chivalry

Something some people have implied really runs against my grain. Please
forgive me, but...

Is someone knighted for fighting? 
I am probably wrong, but I would think a person who fights is knighted
for their behavior and skills ON AND OFF the field. I feel that fighters
can be knighted, but fighting alone should not be the reason. 

To me, the fighting is a forum where the person's chivalrous behavior
may be demonstrated. The most chivalrous person (Chivalry == 'Chevalier'
(French) == Knight) on the field is not always the best, but they
exemplify the ideals we all (I hope) wish to follow. The forum is
necessary so that these qualities may be demonstrated. If a martial
art practiced in the SCA is an area in which these qualities may by
shown, then should we exclude it from the Chivalry? Maybe heavy-list,
fencing, and archery all should be required for a candidate for Knighthood.
Let's think on that for a while.

I must certainly agree, however, with Lady Ariel's point that fencing
is not recognised by all kingdoms. If Knighthood is a Society-wide
award, then it's criteria (or alternates) should all be society-wide.
Gentles who agree that fencing should be part of Chivalry, please 
help us to gain Society-wide acceptance of this art. In this way,
we may avoid this problem in our future efforts.

Unto the fisher folk of the net, greetings from Li Kung Lo. I am moved to
respond to some recent comments regarding the registering of one`s hands as a
deadly weapon. It has recently been stated that no state in the union does
that- well that is almost true. In some states in the East, I am sure that New
York is one, there are archaic laws (I don`t know if they have been repealed
or not) which may require a person`s hands (and no other body part) to be
registered as a deadly weapon if, and only if, they make the majority of their
income from prizefighting (not *teaching*). This was applied to boxers in the
1920`s and 30`s, when they were used as enforcers by the mob. While it is
always a crime to hit somebody,(it might be murder) this made it possible for
such individuals to be charged with assault with a deadly weapon even when it
was not their intent to kill, but just to terrorize. This means that Mike
Tyson`s hands could be legally registered if he was a resident of New York,
but Master Hidy Ochiai`s couldn`t. After all, he doesn`t fight for a living,
he teaches karate. So if we ever get knights who make the majority of their
living by punching people in the lists, we may have to register their hands
(and I`ll quit). In the meantime, please remember that rattan *is* a deadly
weapon, both in fact and in law, so be nice to muggers, and take your shoe off
first, so you can kick them with an *unshod* foot.

re pasties:  not everyone feels comfortable making pie dough, so what i 
suggest is: 	PILSBURY CRESCENT ROLLS!  yup, just like you've seen in the 
bake-offs.  pinch the pairs of triangles into oblongs, fill, fold, and bake 
acording to package directions.  sliced meats and cheese from the delli 
section work just fine...  Or, use commercially availabe frozen bread 
dough--one loaf's worth makes 6 or 8 good sized pasties; these are 
particularly good if your filling has bacon or other fatty or oily stuff in 
it.  While you're looking for the frozen dough, check out the freezer section 
for little fruit pastries...
None of this should inhibit you from trying to make your own bread, it's 
easier than it looks, and very satisfying (one recipie calls for picking the 
dough up and flinging it back onto the table as hard as possible 50 times. 
whee!  other recipies are less vigorous.)  the odor of baking bread is 
heaven...
If your at a tourney, don't forget salt.  it goes on the hard boiled eggs, it 
goes on the raw veggies (a friend brings "turnip chips"--slices of raw turnip 
with coarse salt to sprinkle on, surprisingly good) Another friend jerks her 
own beef (a dehydrator is really usefull for this, you *can* hang it in a just 
barely on oven for a day, but its risky and the results are often not as good) 
 She finds that the beef that seemed *much* to salty when she made it gets 
wolfed down at the war, the extra salt is seldom noticed...

one last word, a large sqare of cloth wraped and tied arround your 2-liter
 bottle of diet coke will easily and effectively disguise it, not so much that 
you will want it on your table, but enough so that it will not obtrude if 
tucked among the baskets...

Subject: pikes vs archers

Unto all fisher-folk of the net Li Kung Lo sends greetings. I would like to
thank Michael McNeil and Kwelland Njal for their informative and stimulating
comments on tactics of the Hundred Years War. After a review of their
comments, including some of the listed sources, I am forced to admit that the
composition of English forces consisted of a much greater percentage of
archers than I had earlier supposed. Nonetheless, it seems that a certain
amount of my original assertion is true, that pikemen and dismounted English
cavalry, many of whom were armed with pikes for that purpose (they probably
hated it!) comprised the solid core of a British division, or "battle",
against which the French chivalry threw themselves, particularly in the
English victories of Crecy, Poitiers, and Agincourt.
        Regarding the composition of British and French forces,Brian Tierney
and Sidney Painter- "Western Europe in the Middle Ages 300-1475" (Fourth
Edition,Knopf, New York,1983), citing "The Chronicles of Froissart"(1),A.H.
Burne(2) ,H.J. Hewitt (3), and R. Russell (4), among others, put the size of
the English army at Crecy at about 9000, 5000 less than Churchill`s estimate,
and this is supposed to be the army whose size is well established by
documents! The same sources put Henry V`s force at Agincourt at 2000
men-at-arms and 6000 archers,with less than 1000 armored cavalry. The issue is
further complicated by the fact that Henry`s force, with an eye toward
mobility, placed infantry on horses so they could keep up with the knights.
Ship`s manifests seem to vary as to whether they listed such "cargo" as
infantry or cavalry, because horses also had to be transported.
It is also suggested that disease and casualties had reduced this army to
about 6000 men, with little information of the distribution of losses.
        A couple of passages do make reference to the usage of the
archery/pikemen connection, to wit:
        "The army was drawn up in three "battles" or divisions, which
consisted of a solid core of dismounted knights and pikemen with archers on
each flank." (p.502)
        "As the French rode up the hill,the English archers poured arrows upon
them,killing many horses and wounding some knights. The few horsemen who
reached the line of English spears were easily killed or captured...After (the
first charge`s) failure, every French division as it arrived on the field
charged up the hill at the English division, and was routed in the same way.
The English archers firing from the flanks always reduced the charging force
to a number that the pikemen could handle without too much difficulty" (p.503)
      It is noted that Sir Charles Oman`s account puts the French numerical
superiority at 3:1, where Ferdinand Lot argues that the French force was
roughly equal to, or even smaller than the English army. It should also be
noted, regarding the alleged (and quite possibly true) "inferiority" of the
Genoese crossbowmen to the English archers in the initial exchange, that they
were not only vastly outnumbered, but had to fire uphill as well.
        Whether the English position could have withstood a massed charge of
the combined French cavalry will never be known, firstly because their numbers
are open to considerable dispute, and because they didn`t do that! Spread out
over several miles of a road, they charged the English line as they arrived on
the scene, and were cut to pieces piecemeal. 
        I would like to say that I have really appreciated the interest in
this issue, and the lively discussion of medieval military tactics on the net.
I hope that eventually we can examine Pennsic tactics in the same lively
fashion with ourselves in the roles of observers and unit commanders. While
the lessons of archers vs. horsemen may seem to be remote, there are lessons
for us all to learn here, both from ancient battles, and from recent Pennsics.
Furthermore, I gratefully concede the point that archers comprised not only
the numerical majority, but the tactical edge of the English army during the
Hundred Years War, while still contending that pikemen were instrumental in
containing and arresting cavalry charges already disorganized and disrupted by
English missile fire.
I would also like to thank Justin du Coeur, without whose gateway assistance I
would never have received the missives to which I am replying.

Ah!  Here, good my lord, you touch on the heart of the SCA.  (My
opinion, as is everything that follows).  

The world we are trying to re-create in the SCA is a feudal society,
and Kings, Barons, Knights and other peers lie at the heart of the
SCA's feudalism.  In a feudal system, each man is bound by fealty and
homage to his lord, from the merest peasant, up to the King himself.
Even a freeman is bound to his lord, though in less onerous ways than
a serf.  The lord offers his protection in times of war and natural
disaster, and in return, the subject gives service to his lord.  In
the SCA, this theme is played out in many ways: Knights and Barons
serve the King, squires serve their Knight, subjects of a Barony serve
the Baron, guild members serve their master.

In the ideal medieval world in which we live, which is an ideal which
is largely adapted from the medieval ideal of itself, all this service
is freely given and graciously received.  The more lofty the lord, the
more he is expected to ask little of his subjects, give much in
return, and give of himself to his own lord.  Thus, a Knight, being
the highest of the King's men, should be a paragon of honor, chivalry,
courtesy, largesse, and prowess.  He should never hesitate to offer
his sword, his body, his goods for his King.  At the same time, he
should take men of his own, and train them in all the arts and skills
in which he excels.  He should support them in all things, so that
they, too, may aspire to higher rank.  Formally, in order to become a
Knight, a gentle must be among the greatest of the Kingdom's fighters,
excelling in all weapons forms and on all fields of combat.  He should
be chivalrous and courteous both on and off the field, and should
honor his lord, his lady, and his peers.  He must be proficient in a
wide range of courtly skills: dancing, heraldry, chess, and other fine
arts.  

In general, all peers are held to these same standards: surpassing
skill in their chosen field, plus a high level of accomplishment in
many areas.  They should show a deep and lasting commitment to the
Society and to its growth.  One peer of my acquaintance defines a peer
as one who has significantly changed the Society for the better.

The King, of course, must be even moreso.  He must serve His land and
His people to His utmost ability.  He must be first in battle and last
in retreat.  He must protect His realm and advance it in all causes,
and in all ways.  He earns the respect due the Crown by comporting
Himself as the finest of His subjects.  Kings are like Barons, but
moreso.  Having more subjects over a greater domain, and having more
lofty subjects, They hold Themselves to a higher standard.

Subject: Knighthood, Fencing, & Archery
Message-Id: <Feb.3.13.28.54.1989.635@vanhalen.rutgers.edu>


Greetings to all!

I have  read with interest the  recent discussion of Knighthood  as it
relates to other martial arts.  This issue has been much  discussed in
the East in the past few years, and has made its way into  Curia Regis
more than once. I have made an effort to try to hear all viewpoints on
this subject,  and  I  would  like to   offer  a  few  ideas, not  all
originally my own.

First, some personal background.  I am not currently a fighter, though
I did fight for several years  when I first  joined the  Society.   I,
too, fenced in college, and I enjoy fencing,  shinai fighting, and the
like.

Now some SCA facts: The Board of Directors has considered the question
of fencing in the SCA, and has specifically  stated that  fencing is a
peripheral activity.  It may not be  the central activity  at an event
(a ruling   most  often observed in  its   breach).   Furthermore, the
current  BoD  (approximately)  has stated  that there  will never be a
separate peerage for fencers.

On to philosophy.  Much of the discussion  on  this issue, relating to
both fencing and archery, has seemed to  assume that knighthood exists
primarily  to recognize martial excellence  in   any field of  martial
arts.  I must compliment Sir Michael of York on  his statement of what
a  knight  should  be,  but his  discussion   too  seemed to make   no
distinction  between martial  arts  in  general and rattan fighting in
particular.  This is an error, I believe.

Rattan fighting occupies a very special place in  the  SCA.  It is THE
central activity of the Society.  After all, that's  how we choose our
Kings.   All of  SCA culture  (sorry, folks,  I  have  a fairly strong
Western European bias) is structured around the Knight in  Armor.  Our
political system, our systems of honors; all are centered on the armed
warrior,  and rattan fighting is THE  form  of warfare in the Society.
Given this special place, it is  right and proper that rattan fighting
should be particularly  recognized  in  our system of rank  and honor.
Note  that  it is  the  only activity  so  recognized  in  the  global
structure of the SCA: the other  award peerages are broadly defined so
as to  admit  AS MANY FIELDS   AS   POSSIBLE,  while  the  Chivalry is
restricted to a single skill.

The growth of other martial  arts in the  SCA has presented  us with a
problem: How do we  recognize  achievement  in these  fields?    If  a
peerage is to be created or opened to these arts, how shall candidates
be  judged?  I  suggest that it  is  inconsistent  with the nature and
structure of the SCA to expect that skill at arms  should be the prime
qualification for a peerage in  archery or fencing.  Only the Chivalry
should be so judged.  A practitioner  of any  other activity should be
judged   by  his  contributions to the  Society   at  large: research,
teaching, AND skill.  Further, it  is   inconsistent with the  general
structure of  awards in the Society to  create high-ranking awards for
other specific skills.  I think  the proper way  to view these martial
arts  is as arts.  The  quality of the  practice of  these arts,  like
skill at dance, brewing, or playing chess,  should be only one of many
qualifications for honor.

Realistically, it may be difficult to convince the Order of the Laurel
to admit archers, fencers, and other  martial  artists to their ranks.
Perhaps we do   need a  new  peerage.  If   so,  it should  be broadly
defined,   an order  for ALL   martial  arts.  It  would be  a  way to
recognize archers,   fencers, gunners,  slingers,   strategists,   and
miltary engineers.  It should have requirements beyond simple skill at
one art, just as the Laurel and Pelican do.  Personally, I think a new
perage would be a bad idea: It  will always be  thought of as  a "Baby
Knighthood",  and will probably never earn   the same respect.  That's
why I think  the "martial arts = arts"  approach will do  more for the
Society at large and for the artists who deserve proper recognition.

As always, I invite reply.  I am ever your friend,

Greetings, my lady.

Although I am not myself a Peer, as Principal Herald of the East, I
have had many conversations with members of the peerage on this and
related topics.  I would venture a few thoughts.

One view of the peerage is that a peer is one who has demonstrated a
long-standing dedication to the Society and to its ideals.  As such,
he needs no reward, since the Society is itself his reward.  The
Society has a pervasive and unfortunate feeling that you work for the
danglies.  This is not the way it should be, and this attitude should
be discouraged.  You work for the honor and personal satisfaction that
the work brings.  If you find yourself rewarded by the Crown for your
deeds, that's wonderful, but the respect and honor are earned, not
granted.  In short, I see no problem, since I see a peer as one who
needs no further reward.

Of course, many might see this feeling as unrealistic.  What of
Master^2 Sir Baron Hugelbert, who has been around forever, and who has
been a triple peer forever?  What do we do to say "Thank you" for his
wonderful efforts THIS year?  

The answer is most assuredly not to keep creating awards at higher and
higher levels.  That route will only lead to making all awards
essentially meaningless.  I call this "Merit badge syndrome".  If you
have many specific awards, each for its own little field, and many
different levels, everyone gets confused.  No one understands where
all the awards rank, and how they compare to each other.  The
seamstresses understand the seamstress awards, the seneschals
understand the seneschal awards, and the archers understand the
archery awards.  But no one really notices what goes on outside his
own little specialty.  The goal becomes not service to the Society,
but collecting as many danglies as possible. 

Of course, this description is an exageration.  However, every kingdom
has examples of awards that have become meaningless because they are
too specific, or too political (which is the same thing).  What makes
awards significant is that there are few of them, and entry into one
puts you into a new and select category.  Let me give an case in
point.  I am Principal Herald of the East.  I have been a full Herald
and member of the College of Arms for seven years.  I am one of the
senior heralds of the Known World.  There is no award for heraldic
accomplishment which could possibly make any real difference to me.
However, when I received my Silver Crescent (EK service award), it was
very important to me.  I didn't need to have the heralds tell me that
I had worked real hard as a herald, but it was wonderful to have
someone tell me that my work as a herald was appreciated by everyone:
seneschals, chirurgeons, autocrats, marshalls.  It was the breadth of
the Order that made it significant.  So it is for the Peerage.  A
peerage is THE highest award: there can be no higher.

As for Master Hugelbert?  Well, you could just go up and say "Thank
you!".  It's really remarkable how good it feels when someone does
that.  If the Crown needs new ideas, why not start using period
titles, offices, and awards?  If Master Hugelbert got his Pelican for
being royal Seneschal six times, why not appoint him "Privy
Counciller", with the right to sit at Curia Regis in perpetuity?  Or,
if he should be rewarded for his dedication to the Crown, why not make
him "Royal Cupbearer" for life, and give him sole right to appoint his
successor, in perpetuity?  If you take a look at period Royal Courts,
you find lots of royal appointments, many of which were only symbolic
and many of which held great power or wealth.  We should use these as
a source for ideas.  Another idea is to give things, rather than
titles.  Largesse, the virtue of the medieval lord, lay in giving
riches, not in giving congratulations.  Why not give His Majesty a
beautiful tapestry depicting Master Hugelbert's life and
accomplishments, and have His Majesty give it to Hugelbert in court?
I think he'll appreciate it more than a new award made up so that they
could give it to him.

Good cheer.

I agree reliance on a single source is not good.  As I've stated
elsewhere, I welcome additional references (so far nobody's posted
any), and I'm investigating other sources of which I've learned.

Meanwhile, as far as Churchill's *History* is concerned, I believe
you're misjudging his work.  It was the English, not Churchill, who
pinned their hopes on the longbow and, just as importantly, on a
professional army organization.  These tactics worked successfully
for the English for quite some time.  Also, you've seen only a few
quotations from Churchill's *History* -- nowhere in his work does
he describe the French as "silly people" (quite the contrary), and
he makes it quite plain that the French certainly did "catch on."  

As Churchill describes in detail, and Li Kung Lo also pointed out,
the next major battle was fought by the French using completely
different tactics from those that failed them so dismally at Crecy.  
Unfortunately for the French, these new tactics -- attack by masses
of dismounted men-at-arms, rather than cavalry charges by mounted
knights -- also failed miserably, at Poitiers.  But the French
eventually did develop tactics that enabled them to successfully
cope with those "insolent Islanders," as Churchill called them.

And, lest people be left with the impression that Churchill's
*History* reads as nothing but glorifying, chauvinistic English
imperialism -- Churchill also makes plain what a tragedy the long,
destructive war was for both sides, how exhausting and distracting
it was from the countries' real concerns -- the well-being of their
people -- and how good in the long run it was for both France *and*
England when the English were finally expelled back to their Island.

	The Midrealm does not support either fencing or combat archery, 
though combat archery *is* practiced in the southern parts of the Kingdom.
And at one Midrealm event combat archery is used, at the second oldest
interkingdom war, Border Raids, between the Midrealm and Meridies.  I believe
that the Midrealm fielded about 1/2 dozen archers or so at this years event,
who were successfull in picking off a few Southerners, and one Herald  :-)
(Don't worry, just make sure the check is in the mail and no names will
be mentioned.  :-)  There is also a move to organize a company of combat 
archers in one Southern Midrealm chapter.

	The year before, the archers were a decisive factor in Meridies'
victory in the bridge battle.  And I would *love* to see combat archery 
in a larger war, either Estriella or Pennsic.

both of them are products of cultures removed temporally from the era

Yes, it is called Staropolski, Deliscious Polish Mead; as the name 
suggests it is produced in Poland. There might be a problem with 
the access though, I know that you can purchase this delightful 
(not exclusively my opinon) fluid of happiness in Chicago. 
Especially in Polish section of the city. It is imported by Stanley
Stawski Distributing Inc. 

Polish Mead comes in medievel looking glass and ceramic bottles.
The prices (don't quote me on this) are ~$5.00 for glass bottle
and ~$7.00 for ceramic one.
 
Perhaps a mail order could be reached, I know at least one place 
in Chicago where you definitely can purchase this mead. It is called
Bacik's Delicatessen on Milwaukee Ave.(I am not affiliated in any 
way with them) Anyway, this could give you a start if you wanted 
to get this mead no matter what... 

I have tried to locate this mead in bay area, however I have failed.
If someone out there will notice this item in local stores please 
let me know. 

Now perhaps I can get some help, I have tried to find a good book
about the variety of Japanese medieval armor as well about the 
types of warriors roaming about at that time. No luck so far, 
can you help? I am just starting in SCA and would like to develop 
a relatively "realistic" character.

Any info would be helpful so please don't be shy about sending 
even the smallest piece of advice.

/* ---------- "Period documentation of Women doing" ---------- */
Good news and bad news for the folk of the rialto.   I have found period
documentation for women doing heavy fighting- running around in armor,
weilding big swords and other implements of destruction, etc.

The bad news is, the source is Japanese.

I am refering to the Heike Monogatari, the JApanese classic of the middle ages
that describes the war for domination betwen the Heike and Hojo clans for
military dominance for Japan in 1085  (The Heike won ushering in the era
of the Kamikura shogunate).  The document is believed to have been written
in the 12th century.  I am using the A.L. Sadler translation which combines
"Tales of the Ten Foot Square Hut and the Tales of The Heike".  (Charles
E Tutle Co. c1972) The quote is from the section entitled: "The Death of
Kiso Yoshinaka"

pg 138: "Now Kiso brought home with him from Sinano two beautiful girls
named Tomoe and Yamabuki....Tomoe had long black hair and a fair complexion,
and her face was very lovely; moreover she was a fearless rider whom neither
the fiercest horse nor the roughest ground could dismay, and so dextrously
did she handle the sword and bow that she was a match for a thousabd warriors,
and fit to meet either god or devil.  Many times had she taken the field,
armed at all points, and won matcheless renown in encounters with the
bravest captains, and so in this last fight, when all the others had been
slain or had fled, among the last seven there rode Tomoe."

This quote is not meant to re-open the debate on Euro vs non Euro
personae.  However, next time anyone challenges a female in the list because
it's not period, tell said gentle to commit seppuku for such impertinence.

This was not always true.  For example: The Hohenstaffen rose from
serfdom  to being Holy Roman Emperors.  Furthermore, the first
'Knights' rose out of the old germanic warbands.  Later, after the collapse
of centrall authority, anyone who could defend themselves and a number of surro
unding people became 'knights.'  Certainly most of these came from the
wealthy classes, being able to afford arms, horses, etc.  But, in the
beginning of the period when these people were looking for local armies,
those willing to help out, in exchange for weapons, armor, etc. later
became the local knights.
One additional case: During the Unlaw in England (I forget the dates,
eleventh century) the number of knights, baronies, etc. proliferated
exponentially as Stephen and Matilda attempted to win over anyone who would
fight for them.

Of course, after the Unlaw, things tighten up again.

A while back I posted for some information on illumination materials.
Someone said they had a "fake" gold leaf that looked authentic,
lasted a long time (I'd hope for at least 10 years), was easy to work
with, and didn't cost much.

Can anyone point me at such a substance? A company name and city
would be sufficient, although an address or phone number would be
better.

I'm also looking for a good "base" for putting down a gold dust
background. I've got a bronze powder that is the "perfect" color and
marvelous consistency. I've tried linseed oil, but it's too thin
and I can't get sufficient color consistency. I've seen but yet too
try some sun cured linseed oil that should be much thicker. Drying
time is not a consideration. Most projects can be put on hold for
quite a while, and there are drying agents that can speed it up.

My persona would benefit from being able to carry a period firearm.  For

a flintlock.  Living in the early 1500's, it would be appropriate
for him to carry a wheel lock or matchlock pistol.

The trouble is, I can't seem to find any! Does anyone know of a source
for replica wheel locks or matchlocks? I'd prefer non-firing, as I know
they will be less expensive, but I'll take information on _any_
match or wheel locks.

Subject: Life After Peerage?  A view from somewhere beneath the top

In Digest #240, Elizabeth Braidwood (Donna Hrynkiw) asked if there were life
after peerage, and cited an example of a peer who receives no further awards.
I must preface my remarks by saying that I am not a peer myself, nor am I
likely to ever be, but that I am apprenticed to a Laurel in calligraphy whose
views I pretty much share.  The ones you're reading are mine, though, not his.

I am afraid that the quest for awards is one of the prime motivating factors
behind some of the achievers in the SCA.  This is why you see a drop-off among
many peers: they were in it to get the award, and now they have it -- so on
to something else.  Never mind the craft or the skill; it was only a means to
an end.  Award-mongering is a scary phenomenon, particularly here in the
competitive East.

That scenario doesn't by any means fit all the peers here (or anywhere), though.
Of those who do what they do for the sheer love of it, there are some who were 
bemused by the idea of being a peer.  They shine up the medal, wear it to
Kingdom events, and otherwise just go back to what they were doing.  I know of
one Laurel who, in spite of the fact that he really did deserve it, was so
dismayed at receiving a peerage that he killed off his persona.  He's still
working at his craft, though.

As for "my" Laurel, I think he kind of gets a kick out of polling lists and
awestruck newbies, but he'd be doing the same thing even if he had no awards
at all.  He has always taught (though now he can take apprentices), he has
always contributed in whatever way he can, and he will always be like that.  It
is why I apprenticed to him in the first place; lots of people are Laurels, but
his outlook is admirable to me.

As for whether there should be more awards made: I'm afraid I don't have a
whole lot of sympathy for people who just do what they do for awards.  The joy
of the craft (or the work itself) should be its own reward.  You should receive
a peerage as much for your joy in the work as in your achievement of it.

This doesn't mean that good work should go unrecognized.  It does mean that a
person like Lord Joe Blow (from Elizabeth's example) should be content with
being a peer, and if it pleases the Crown to thank him further for his good
works, make him a Court Baron or give him some other sort of recognition...
but surprise him.  Cut off award-mongering at the peerage level, and give him
the Court Barony for his joy in what he does.  If he truly loves what he does,
he might not even notice the extra alphabet soup being heaped on him.

Apparently, in the West Kingdom there *is* life after Peerage.  The West
Kingdom has an award called the Silver Molet for peers who display the
characteristics of a peer *after* they have become peers.  This is a
non-armigerous award.

Subject: a minor point about dates

    Hello from Bergental, EK,
       In the recent barrage of verbiage concerning the diversity/non-euro
debate, I kept seeing an erroneous statement being declared as fact; namely,
that the dates of our historical re-enactment span from 600 to 1600 AD.
As I understand it, the time period has *no* starting date.  Sir Hilary of
Serendip stated in a recent column in TI that the Society attempts to re-
create pre-seventeenth century Western culture.  While I'll admit that the
term "Western" is extremely vague and subjective, the time period is quite
straight-forward.  I would also venture that this does not limit the Society
to the so-called "Age of Chivalry," but also includes the heroic age that
preceeded it,and that produced the Homeric epics in its beginning and the
Irish epics like the Tain Bo Culaigne(sp?) at its end.  I felt compelled to
mention this because I was considering a fifth cent. BC Scythian persona
when I first joined. In addition, I don't think that I would have joined
the SCA had I been limited to the later periods--although now I find it
equally fascinating, in the beginning I was interested only in the golden
age of the Celts (you gotta admit, the last 15 centuries haven't been too
easy on us celts.), and its surrounding cultures.
      And now, good gentles, before the flaming starts, please remind your-
selves that this is an opinion only, and a minority opinion at that.Adieu.

Subject:  A few remarks

Greetings!

I wish to thank those who have picked up on the topic of Gate Guardians, and
have offered helpful hints.  I would especially like to thank Kateryne of
Hindscroft for some particularly useful suggestions.

I've been talking to various people, and as a result now have something of my
own to add:  autocrats who are having gate guardians take down info from
arriving gentles (tag numbers, driver's name, etc.) *why* the info is useful.
The usual reasons tend to include:  site security, the campground wants to
know, and in case of emergency.  When an irate driver asks why the requested
information is desired, it's better if the gate guard's answer is something
other than "I don't know."  This may seem like common sense, and like an
explanation shouldn't be needed, but I guess we need to remember that common
sense ain't always common!

About site security:  personally, I think this deserves more attention from
autocrats.  At one event a number of years ago, at a frequently-used
campground in an area which is partially residential, nearly 2 dozen vehicles
parked in a darkened area had one or more tires slashed.  We have also caught
intruders.  Even fairly remote sites are not necessarily _de_facto_ safe from
intrusion.  The only successful answer we have found has been 'round-the-clock
gate guards and stepped-up security patrols.

I would also like to thank Justin de Coeur for his supportive remarks.  To
them I would add, beware also of those who are supremely convinced of their
own rightness.  *No one* has a monopoly on the truth, and those who try to
impose their views on the rest of the world _via_ legislation are as dangerous
as those who attempt to legislate ethics, morality, and behavior.  Opposition
to individuals such as these is important in protecting us all, but cannot
succeed unless a group effort (nothing succeeds like peer pressure).  And,
remember:  there is another side to the coins named chivalry and honor.
That's the side that calls for one to stand up against something wrong,
instead of hiding behind a fear of being discourteous.

Regarding Lady Branwen's question about food, the only suggestion I'd like to
make here is:  pasties!

                                  In Service,

Subject:  Carrying Lunch

Enid here, courtesy of Henry.

Branwen, in reply to request for portable food.

We nearly always take our own lunch with us, because we, like
you, get hungry and are tired of "freaking the mundanes"
in fast food joints.

I usually make up some kind of pasty.  This weekend we
were eating one of my variants of chicken pasties lombard--
cold cooked chicken, leeks, bacon and spices (I use coriander,
ginger, pepper, sage and the like).  Sometimes I add apple or
raisons, and sometimes, I use all or part beef (cooked).
An egg, a little stock, gravy, beer or wine can be used for a
wetter pasty, but is not necessary.  If you don't use
bacon, I recommend you add some other fat like butter.

Mushrooms are a nice addition. Celery and carrots are also good.
Rabbit pasties (eaten  reverently, of course) are delicious.

Sometimes I make apple pasties for dessert.  One time
currants were in season, so I made red currant puff
pasties (just sprinkled a little sugar on the currants.

I use a lard pastry.  Enough for one double piecrust makes
two large pasties.  Make the piecrust a little tougher than usual
(crisco works well for this, I just don't like it).

Cold quiche lorraine (use bacon, onion, cream  and REAL swiss
emmental) is delicious and filling.

Another tasty way to transport food is to get a nice, dark
sturdy wholegrain bread, cut off the top, and scoop out the
inside.  Mix the inside bread (lumps or crumbs) with cold
meat, cheese, celery, onions, oil, hard boiled eggs--any
or all in combination, including pepper and herbs of your
choice.  Mix well so that the oil and liquid penetrates the
bread.

Put this stuffing back into the bread and put the lid on.

Apecius calls this Sala Cattabia.  There's
a medieval variant called Rastyns, which just sautes the
scooped out bread in butter, and then stuffs it back into the hollow.

You haven't said whether you would find modern packaging a problem...
We use modern wrapping (tin foil) but pack stuff inside a
picnic basket.  (Sometimes I remove the tin foil before entering
the site, and wrap the pasties in a cloth, as the medievals would
have done.)

I've also carried stews and soups inside a
large thermos.  (Pour stuff out into SCA vessels, and hide
thermos.)

More simply, there is always cold meat (ham, chicken legs),
homemade bread, hardboiled eggs, cheese, salad, olives, pickles,
and fruit.
Salad nicoise (tuna, green beans, hard boiled eggs, olives,
lettuce, cucumbers in oil and vinegar) is a nice all in one dish.

For drinking, if we are being authentic but not drinking
alcohol, I have brought
fruit "shrubs"  (something like sekanjabin, but made as a
concentrate from raspberries, cherries, currants...).
I transport the concentrate in a Grolsch bottle.
Cider and milk are also possibilities.

With our Canadian weather, for six months of the year at least,
there is no problem with leaving things in the car.  When the
weather gets hotter, we have a small cooler that the food goes
into.  Canadian Tire sells insulated carry all bags, and you can
pop a lunch into one, with a frozen ice pack (also at Canadian tire)
and that will work nearly as well.

Nearly anything will keep for a morning unless it

I have also made a habit of bring lunch to events after learning
that my body does not easily tolerate going without food or drink
for eight hours or so.

In addition to Eowyn Eilonwy of Alewife Brook's excellent
suggestions I would suggest two others:

One can buy small glass flasks which have a corked mouth and two
places to string a cord so that it may go around your neck.  One
lady of my acquaintance keeps rosewater in it during the summer
months.  'Rosewater' actually takes the form of pink lemonade or
Cherry 7 UP!

Any number of Middle Eastern foods usually available at supermarket
delis are period.  Buy them at the store, repack them into crockery
and simple, period food is yours!

***Soapbox Warning***

This problem of people climbing to the top of the heap, then dropping off, is
one more example of one of my big problems with the SCA -- there is *far* too
much emphasis on awards! Yes, I know that it's basically human to go after the
dangling carrot, and that it's certainly period, but that doesn't make it any
better for the Society as a whole.

I'm not sure that there's any way to change this, but I encourage people to
think about just *why* they work for the Society. Are you doing it for the
carrot? It's not a good reason; I've seen more people burn out a) before
getting the award they want, because they felt it was deserved and overdue,
or b) after, when they realized that they had achieved their goal.

A piece of paper is a hollow award; don't give it more significance than it
deserves. When you get an award in court, it's a great thrill -- for about a
week. Once the novelty wears off, though, it's back to business as usual,
and if that business as usual is trying to get that award, the world is
suddenly a less purposeful place.

Don't confuse cause and effect. The award should be an afterthought. Yes, it's
a great honor. But it shouldn't be why you're doing what you do. Do what you
want to do because the *task* is what you want, not because of the award. If
you must work for something, work for the respect of those around you, which
is not automatically conferred by a slice of parchment, and which cannot be
given -- you have to earn it every day.

Subject: alt.sca Digest

As a few people know, the alt.sca --> SCA mailing list gateway has flaked
out in the past week. It seems to be working in the other direction (I'm
seeing a few messages that I'm sure appeared first in the mailing list on
alt.sca), but the people of the mailing list are missing out on the
discussions going on in alt.sca.

Therefore, in order that things not diverge *too* much, I'm going to 
manually gateway the messages from alt.sca to the mail list each day, until
the gateway comes back up. This is a strictly interim solution -- my news
feed is far from the fastest, and I don't get all messages. But it's 
better than nothing.

This is the alt.sca Digest for Feb. 8, which also includes a few other
messages that have gone out in the past week that I thought were fairly
important.

Well, yes -- of course it is possible that Churchill was biased in
this regard, although he was not inexperienced in military matters,
and historian Henry Steele Commager did produce a condensed edition
of Churchill's *History* -- implying a certain respect for the work.  
I was hoping others here could provide additional references (also,
please see the end of this article for a list of works I've learned
of but haven't yet had a chance to peruse).  Until I can do so, for a
perspective on the matter other than Churchill's, let's consider the
Battle of Crecy from the *Encyclopaedia Britannica*'s point of view:

	*Crecy, Battle of* (Aug. 26, 1346), a victory for the English
	in the first decade of the Hundred Years' War against the
	French.  Edward III of England, having landed some 4,000
	men-at-arms and 10,000 archers (longbowmen) on the Cotentin
	peninsula in mid-July 1346, had ravaged lower Normandy west
	of the Seine and gone as far south as Poissy, just outside
	Paris, when Philip VI of France, uncertain of the direction
	that Edward meant ultimately to take, advanced against him
	with some 12,000 men-at-arms and numerous other troops.

	Edward then turned sharply northeastward, crossing the Seine
	at Poissy and the Somme downstream from Abbeville, to take up
	a defensive position at Crecy-en-Ponthieu.  There he posted
	dismounted men-at-arms in the centre, with cavalry to their
	right (under his son Edward, the Black Prince) and to their
	left (under the earls of Arundel and of Northampton) and with
	archers on both wings.  Italian crossbowmen in Philip's service
	began the assault on the English position, but they were routed
	by the archers and fell back into the path of the French
	cavalry's first charge.

	More and more French cavalry came up, to make thoughtless
	charges at the English centre; but while the latter stood firm,
	the archers wheeled forward, and the successive detachments of
	horsemen were mowed down by arrowshots from both sides.  By the
	end of the day Philip's brother, Charles II of Alencon, and his
	allies King John of Bohemia and Louis II of Nevers, count of
	Flanders, as well as 1,500 other knights and esquires were
	dead.  Philip himself escaped with a wound from the disaster.  
	Edward went on northward to besiege Calais. {1}

So far I'd say this supports the "arrow" vis-a-vis the "pike" theory,
both considering estimated relative numbers (10,000 archers compared
with 4,000 men-at-arms) and the overall effectiveness of the archers.  

Continuing on, I quote from Lynn Montross (Historian during the period
1950-61 for the U.S. Marine Corps, author of *War Through the Ages*) in
his *Encyclopaedia Britannica* article "Warfare, Conduct of (Tactics)":

	The use of gunpowder in the 14th century made it inevitable
	that the supremacy of the man of iron in his house of stone
	could not be long maintained.  But the first handguns were not
	as effective as either the crossbow or the English longbow, and
	it was actually the rise of disciplined forces of yeomen using
	infantry tactics that restored the balance between the
	offensive and defensive in medieval Europe.

	Although a few weapons using gunpowder were present on the
	field of Crecy in 1346, the outcome owed more to the discipline
	and tactics of an English army in which each man received a
	fixed and regular wage.  For it was truly a national army that
	Edward III led to France, and the French knights would probably
	have been defeated even if the invaders had been armed with a
	less effective weapon than the six-foot longbow.  Its
	superiority over the crossbow of the Genoese mercenaries was
	proved during a preliminary exchange of missiles.  Edward had
	placed his dismounted men-at-arms in the centre as spearmen,
	and on both projecting wings the lightly armoured archers stood
	behind ditches and pointed stakes.  They poured deadly flights
	of arrows into the front and flanks of the advancing French
	knights until 16 successive charges had been repulsed with
	heavy losses.  {...}

	After beating mailed horsemen who had resisted tactical change,
	the English {...} in their turn were defeated because they
	lagged behind the military progess of the age.  It had taken
	weapons of gunpowder a century and a half to have much
	influence on tactics, but at the siege of Orleans in 1428-29
	both sides used cannon firing stone balls.  The French guns
	were better served than the mortars and bombards brought by the
	English, who met defeat at the Battle of Patay after abandoning
	the siege.

	Charles VII of France (1403-61) raised the first standing army
	of the Middle Ages -- 9,000 permanent troops, paid and armed by
	the king.  This force gradually won back the French territory
	conquered by the English in the Hundred Years' War, and at
	the Battle of Formigny in 1450 the invaders were decisively
	defeated after making their customary defensive stand with the
	longbowmen on both wings.  Instead of launching their usual
	charge, the outnumbered French brought up culverins, or
	medieval fieldpieces, and cut the English archers to pieces
	with enfilade fire. {2}

Montross's article also emphasizes the power of the longbow at Crecy
(although he argues against a point I made in an earlier posting, in
which I maintained that the English could not have won without their
archers).  Montross describes the English center as being manned by
"spearmen" who (as the 'Crecy' article put it) "stood firm," but both
articles state that this center was composed of dismounted men-at-
arms -- whom I understand to be knights (or would-be knights) -- not a
professional, yeoman "pikeman class."  This is just a quibble, though.

I'm aware, by the way, that there were many other battles than Crecy
in the Hundred Years' War.  I've used Crecy as an example -- albeit a
glaring one -- of the role of longbow archers in that war.  If people
would care to discuss other battles, I'd be pleased to participate.

Also, while we're discussing the subject of pikemen versus archers...
prior to the Hundred Years' War with France, there were wars in
Wales and Scotland (whence England learned "many hard lessons,"
according to Churchill).  The Scots did their fighting during this
period primarily by means of circular formations known as "schiltrons,"
composed, as Churchill put it, "mainly of the hard, unyielding spearmen
who feared nought and, once set in position, had to be killed." {3}

Churchill discusses in detail three major battles with Scotland.  
In the first of these, the Battle of Stirling Bridge, an English
army was massacred.  During the second, Falkirk, the Scots army was
exterminated, and Scotland conquered and subjugated.  Finally, under
Robert the Bruce, at Bannockburn, another English army was destroyed
with much slaughter, and Scotland was finally free.  Of Bannockburn,
Churchill wrote, "The Scots claimed to have slain or captured thirty
thousand men, more than the whole English army, but their feat in
virtually destroying an army of cavalry and archers mainly by the
agency of spearmen must nevertheless be deemed a prodigy of war." {4}

By the way, the "Bibliography" section at the end of *Britannica*'s
"Warfare, Conduct of" article lists some titles that likely contain
answers, or at least clues, towards resolution of our debate.  Works
in the Bibliography that seem worthy of perusal in this regard include:

	Tactics (Military):  J.F.C. Fuller, *A Military History of
	The Western World*, 3 vol. (1954-56; British title, *Decisive
	Battles of the Western World, and Their Influence upon
	History*); Lynn Montross, *War Through the Ages*, rev. 3rd ed.
	(1960); R.A. Preston, S.F. Wise, and H.O. Werner, *Men in Arms*

Note that Churchill is highly enough regarded by military historians
to have his work *Marlborough* referenced in the Bibliography.  I'll
try to locate a few of the above titles and see what they have to say.

Oh goody, I get to start guessing again (its one of my favourite pastimes).

Impregnating leather with wax results in the SCA version of cuir bolli, i.e.
the hardened leather that we use for armour (I say SCA version because it
has not been proven to be the historical technique). That means that it might
be good for the soles of the shoes but not the uppers.

Coating the leather in wax rather than impregnating it should work, except
where the leather flexes. The movement will make the coating flake off.
{Bart just stopped by and pointed out that I was assuming the use of a hard
wax. Soft waxes are available and will work. Bart claims that you can get
waxes to waterproof hiking boots from the appropriate stores.}

Tent waterproofing stuff sounds interesting, try it.

My theory is that the period answer was to impregnate the leather with oil.
This results in a dull finish on the leather and if you overdo it, some oil
will migrate onto your feet, through whatever you covered your feet with.
The answer is to use just barely enough oil, making sure that it is the right
sort. Mink oil is recommended.

The shoes will only fall apart if the stiching breaks. You should expect
cotton to break. Waxed linen would be much better but sinew or artificial
sinew would be best.

	Definitely mink oil.  Here's the drill:

	Take mink oil (more like bacon grease at room temp), and rub it into
the leather, especially seams, and flex areas.  thoroughly cover all outside
leather, and rub it in until it is all absorbed by the leather (the leather
will look 'wet').  Let it dry (no heat!) until it looks like dry leather again.
Repeat one or two more times.  Reapply if you develop leaks, or if the
leather seems to get wet easily if exposed to water (when in constant use
canoeing, in the water several times a day up to my ankles or more, reapplic-
ation was required after 3 weeks or so.  In normal SCA wear, they should last
6 months to a year or more.)

	Works wonders.  Smells nice too (depends on taste).

Yep, you are wrong.  There is currently no state in the Union or province
in Canada which requires black belts or any other martial artist to
register their appendages as deadly weapons with the police, the city,
the state, or what-have-you.  I'm not sure how this legend began, but it

)comments on this subject.
)Benjamin di Rosa of Aldea

	I dislike the idea for a few reasons.  The foremost of these is
that not all Kingdoms allow fencing, which in and of itself rules out
the idea.  Before proposing that this be allowed, you would have to 
make major changes in some kingdoms, and I do not think that this is likely
to happen.

	Another reason I feel this is a bad idea is that it brings us
closer to an attitude that is distinctly out of period, that knighthood
be given for reasons other than service to the crown.  And there is at
least one in period reference to the opinion that fencing, since it is
*not* an art of war, it is therefore not a service to the king, and 
the study of it is therefore to be discouraged.

	Indeed, the attitude of fencers in Ansteorra while I was there
was that they were either recreating a street brawl or a duel, neither
of which uphold the ideals of chivalry that we expect of our knights.
Ansteorra *did* (and i understand, does) have an Kingdom level award 
for fencers, something I think any kingdom that wants to support 
fencing should have.  And the "Dons" of Ansteorra are indeed respected
for thier expertice, deservedly so.

	I feel the same arguements apply to archery.  Combat archery
is not legal in all kingdoms.  Regular archery, while legal in all
kingdoms, does not involve any personal combat, something I personally
see as a requirement (It's hard to be brave shooting at a bale of
hay.)  Both archery and fencing take as much work as heavy weapons
to become proficient in, but neither is as universal (in the SCA)
or as unique as heavy.  

	I *strongly* disagree with the opinion quoted concerning
the Order of the Laurel and these arts.  I see *no* reason why
someone who has enriched thier kingdom by practicing and teaching
these arts should be considered less worthy than someone who has 
spent the same amount of time at costuming or cooking.  I *do*
feel that this is the peerage accolade that should be offered our
best in these arts.

	I'm surprised that no one has ventured that Scouts should
be offered knighthood (or even mentioned them.)  Certainly they
show the level of bravery I expect, going into the woods with 
all those brain-damaged fighters...

evolved out of the professional mounted soldier (which is why both
the German and the French words refer to him as rider or horseman.)

	I take some beef jerky along to most events.  Either homemade
or bought, this is a nice way to take the edge off of a mid-day
appetite.  Cheese and bread are also simple and effective, and
can be transported without refigeration.  Don't forget a knife! :-)

Having been in this position myself recently at an event in the canton of 
Trinovantia, I sympathize with you, my lady.  So I have enclosed a marvelous
recipe which is easy for even "food simpletons".  This bread, served with 
honey butter (one cup butter plus a quarter cup or half cup of honey, mixed
to taste) makes a wonderful, light midday snack.  Try and enjoy !

MEDIEVAL PARSLEY BREAD                 Servings:

6   c.        unbleached flour         1   tsp.  dried rosemary
1 3/4 c.      warm water               1   tsp.  dried basil
3   pkg.      active dry yeast         1/2 tsp.  cinnamon
1 1/2 c.      finely chopped parsley   6   T.    honey
1 2/3 T.      coarse salt              3 whole eggs plus two yolks
6   T.        melted butter

    Sprinkle yeast on 1/2 cup of warm water.  Stir in honey, let sit for
5 minutes.  Add remaining water, beat in about 2 1/2 to 3 cups flour.  Beat
with a wooden spoon for about 200 strokes.  Cover with damp towel, put in a
warm place, and allow to rise for 30-45 minutes, or until doubled.
	Stir down, beat in salt, melted butter, 3 whole eggs, plus extra yolk.
Crush dried herbs and add 1/2 cup parsley.  Mix with cinnamon and add to
batter, stirring well.  Beat in remaining flour with spoon, then with hands
work until dough comes away from sides of bowl.
	Turn out onto a lightly floured board and knead until smooth, shiny and
elastic, about 10-20 minutes, adding small amounts of flour if necessary.
Place in a buttered bowl, cover with damp towel, let rise in a warm place
until doubled, about 50 minutes.  Punch down, cover and let rise again until
doubled, about 30 minutes.  Punch down.  Turn out onto a floured surface.
Let dough rest 5 minutes.  Shape into three free form curls or twists.  Place
on buttered cookie sheet.  Cover lightly with damp towel and let rise until
doubled, about 25 minutes.
	Preheat oven to 375F.  Brush loaves with beaten egg yolk.  Bake about
50 minutes or until browned and loaf sounds hollow when rapped on top and
bottom.  Cool on rack.

	Hmmm.  I had (in moments of purely idle fancy) wondered what
I would do if I were ever offered knighthood, and decided that I would
probably go with Master at Arms instead.  Part of this was personal,
part of it was persona, but both really boiled down to the fact that
some of the first members of the Chivalry that I met were MSCA, and
the fact that I would rather not be required to swear Fealty to 
everyone who won crown, some I probably wouldn't want to, and in 
other cases there are people to whom I owe debts of friendship and
honor, and having sworn Fealty to my King might interfer with these
bonds.  This reading, which I hadn't heard of before, would make
things a lot simpler...

Is there life after peerage?

My vision is of hundreds of zombies with little medalians dangling
from their rotting garb, arms outstreatched, eyes blank, stiffly
converging on Court.  Ever seen anything like this?  Not even once?
I haven't either, so I guess I'm a firm believer in life after
peerage.

Consider the scenario where someone gets a <your favorite peerage
here> and suddenly has nothing to strive for in the SCA.  That's it.
Finished.  Time to go home.  Out to pasture.  *Sigh*.  "Guess I'll
die now....."

Sorry chum, your problem isn't endemic, but has to do with an
attitude that I have very little respect for.  I have a very
different view, to wit: Peerage is not an award, it is a
responsibility.  Sure you get a pretty shiny thing.  Sure some people
start treating you differently.  Sure you can feel insecure about it.
Sure you go to order meetings.  Sure lots of things about Society
life change for you.  And SURE, your productivity can slack off,
perhaps permanantly.  Yes, it is a problem.  But lets look at some of
the reasons why:

	The "I've made it to the top, I can coast now" syndrome (from
Elizabeth Braidwood's famous posting): Perhaps someone made a
mistake.  Oh, well.  We'll find a way to live with you.

	Sure, you get a pretty shiny thing: If you get so entranced by
the thing, then you miss the essence of peerage.  Of course you feel
listless, the symbol is mere heraldry and nothing by itself.

	Sure, some people start treating you differently: Very
unfortunate.  Some new peers have a hard time dealing with this.  "I
lost most of my friends," said a Knight to me.  Suddenly you are not
one of the gang.  Some people get very nice to you, and this can be
confusing (do they want something or do they genuinely like you).
You aquire enemies you never met.  This is one of the pitfalls of
Peerage.  It has to do with people thinking you are more than a
person.

	Sure, you can feel insecure about it: Do you know how many new
Peers burn themselves out (sometimes permanently) after receiving the
accolade because they are trying to re-earn their Peerage?  Too many.

	Sure, you go to order meetings: Sometimes the politics are
lethal.  Kills some new folk too.

	And SURE, your productivity goes down: Dealing with all of the
above tends to take some time.  When a new peer is made we hope and
pray they will survive the transition.  The idea is to try and
support the person, and hope they've got the right stuff to ride out
the storm.  You see, their role in the Society does change.

People look at you differently.  They expect more of you, and in ways
you might not expect.  "I can't be in a bad mood," said one Laurel,
"I'm critisized for un-peerly conduct so if I've had a bad week I
don't go to an event".  The pressure can be very tense in the
begining, especially if you are feeling a bit shy and the person next
to you feels just a bit jelous.  Then, insidiously, out comes the
biting comment, the dirty look.

When you become a Peer what happens, in my humble opinion, is that
you come into a position of responsibility in the Society.  Folks
will approach you will seek your counsel.  The Royalty will solicit
your opinion about how they should run their Kingdom and whom they
should make a peer.  You will find yourself in more of a leadership
position.  Chances are you are very experienced in the SCA and can
handle all this.  Sometimes it will go to your head and you wind up
living more of an illusion than reality.  As Lady Elizabeth's posting
re-affirms: You only get the respect you make for yourself.

If you feel you have made it to the top with your Peerage, and there
is nothing else to do, then I think you are making a very big
mistake.  In the end the Society is a community, and awards are not
our main purpose, people are.  One would tend to think that part of the
Peerage requirements is a dedication to the people of the Society.
The accolade is significant, tho' not as an ending, but as another
begining.

To the fisher-folk of the Known World, greeting from Lady Marian
Greenleaf, of the Barony-Marche of the Debateable Lands, East Kingdom:

I have been following the debate about knighthoods for fencing/archery
with a fair amount of interest, since the question of how to raise a
person to the peerage for achievement in one of these areas is
something I have been thinking about on and off for several years.  
This is an issue on which emotions can run fairly high, so I think it's
important that such facts as are available be accurately presented.  (I hope
I myself haven't misrepresented anything in this missive; if I did I stand 
ready to be corrected (with proper documentation, of course. ;-) ))
I notice that  "pnet01!pro-angmar!troubadour@trout.nosc.mil (Don Levey)"
(who unfortunately forgot to indicate his SCA name on his message), says in
Digest #238:

>The highest rank, that
>of Don of Fence, seems to have been designed to be similar to Knighthood
>in many respects. From reports I have heard, there were originally 
>supposed to be three types of Dons: those awarded for teaching, those for
>research, and those for skill. The award for skill seems to be closer to
>the Order of the Tyger Combattant (all above are East Kingdom awards, by
>the way). Perhaps the others have parallels in other awards as well?
>Anyway, these three had eventually become rolled into one. There have
>been disagreements with the system as a whole, but that doesn't enter
>into this.

This passage might leave the impression that the East Kingdom has
established an Order of Dons as a Kingdom-level award.  Without
reference to whether or not the Kingdom *should* have done it, I point
out that it did NOT establish such an award.  There is a rank of Don
given and recognized among the fencers themselves (to the extent that
the fencers of the East are an organized body, a point on which opinion
varies, but I don't know enough about it to hold much of an opinion.)  It
was my understanding that, as stated above, this rank was originally
established to recognize achievement in teaching, research or skill.
It is presented to a condidate (usually in a Court with permission of the 
presiding noble) by the existing Dons.  However, the East Kingdom did not 
establish this award, and it carries no precedence.  That doesn't mean
"no prestige"; squiring is likewise unofficial, for instance.

What the East Kingdom DID do (here I will allow some personal opinion
to creep in just to add a little color) is fart around for several years
about the issue of having any official award for fencing at all.
Having established such an award for archery, I don't think it should
have taken so long to get one established for fencing, but a number of
people expressed concern that fencing might turn out to be just a flash
in the pan, and not inspire the kind of sustained interest that merits
a means of permanent recognition on its own.  Last year this argument
was finally overcome (whether or not it was being used by some as a
smokescreen for other concerns), and an award with the holding name of
the "Guardsmen" was established as an Order of Honor.  This means it is
on the same level of precedence as the Terpsichore (dance) and the
Troubadour (entertainment), and does not carry with it an automatic AoA
for non-armigerous recipients.  Thus, it does not rank with the
Saggitarius for archery or the Tygers Combattant for rattan combat, or
with any other Order of High Merit.  Maybe it ought to.  (If you think it
ought to, you can *politely* present your reasoning to the Crown of the
East in the form of a letter.  It is the Crown that establishes awards,
with the advice of Curia.  Please remember that there are substantial
arguments--by which I mean reasoning that carries some validity--both
for and against official recognition of fencing.)

What all this means is that, officially, being a "Guardsman" here carries
more precedence than being a "Don", though unofficially it may well
carry more weight with one's fellow fencers to be a "Don".  So,
"Don" probably doesn't mean the same thing in the East as it does in
Ansteorra, though the individuals who bear the title may be equally
deserving.

About the issue of establishing more peerages for those combat
activities which really don't fit well into our traditional notion of
knighthood, the jury's still out for me on that one.  If I suddenly
found myself responsible for recognizing someone with a peerage for
this sort of activity, I would really be in a dilemma because
Society-Wide Awards are defined in Corpora, which even Monarchs can't
affect at will (and that's a good thing 99% of the time in my opinion.)
I think I'd take at look at what Ansteorra does . . .

By the way, is there anyone knowledgeable about these things who's
willing to post about just what Ansteorra DOES do?  I mean, is Don-hood
(or whatever the substantive form is) a peerage, an Order of High
Merit, or what?  Does it carry a Grant of Arms?  If it's a Patent of
Arms, how was that reconciled with Corpora?

I realized that all this heraldic-style ranking may be of little
interest to some folks, but it's part of the official way of keeping
track of things . . .   I think it's quite true that what's in the
hearts/minds of the people is the real meaning of recognition, and
what's in the heart and mind of the individual is the real meaning of
deservedness.  But the outward, official stuff is admittedly nice to
have; even better when it jibes with the inward.

Subject: Is there "Life After Peerage"?

To the folk who fish off the Rialto :-) from Elizabeth Braidwood, Greetings.

I'd like to bring up a new topic for consideration...
While at a not-sca gathering of sca folk, one of the topics that came up
was: "Is there Life After Peerage?"

Consider: Joe of Blow, after many years of hard work, research, and toil
becomes a Peer (choose your favourite order). Joe being the enthusiastic guy
he is, *continues* to work hard, do research and toil at his craft - if he
weren't a Peer already, they'd give it to him AGAIN. But, because Joe has
already received the highest honour his King and Queen can give him, he
receives no more recognition. (Oh, alright, there are Throne Favours and
Court Barons/esses and such. But you know what I mean.) He's already at the
top of the heap - there's no award that can be given to him to acknowledge
the the outstanding/stupendous/incredible/more-than-anyone-else work he's
done for his kingdom.  (For the purposes of this argument, Joe will never
have access to a Royal Peerage.)

Our (the sca folk at a non-sca gathering) immediate reaction was "Well,
make another award." Something above Peer (and maybe Viscount/ess) but
below the Royal Peers. But I'm not sure that this is the answer.

Is this a problem? I've heard that it's common for a new Peer's
"productivity" to fall off after a few years - *permanently*. Could be due
to burnout, but I'll bet you that a lot of it is the "I've made it to the
top, I can coast now" syndrome.

Do you care? I realize that most of us don't have to worry about this
problem, but consider your favourite Peer and think how he/she feels. How
does he/she cope with post-peerhood?

Is it any of our (non-peers) business? Alright you Peer-types. How do *you*
feel after the shine has worn off your danglie? Is there Life After Peerage?

	I beg to differ.  In fact, I object vigorously and strenuously.  We are
	here to recreate all that was good and noble about the Middle Ages, not
	to perpetuate the ignorance, intolerance, injustice, and violence that
	was rampant in those days.  We celebrate the high civilization that
	rose like phoenix from the ashes--a civilization that defied the
	pettiness and narrowmindedness of ordinary men.  

	This is the Dream of the SCA:  That the world we have created is
	better, nobler, and truer than the mundane world, or even the historic
	Age of Chivalry.  The Society we reproduce existed nowhere except in
	the minds and hearts of a few people who set themselves the hard task
	of being better than they were expected to be, of living up to the
	ideal everyone admired, but few people had the energy to strive for.

	Each and everyone one of us is a member of the SCA because we have been
	inspired by the high ideals, however they are manifested in persona or
	costume.  We are all lords and ladies.  Consider this: The average SCA
	person is better educated, more tolerant, more intelligent, more
	creative, more honorable than the average human being.  We are members
	of the SCA because the SCA applauds and supports us whereas the average
	mundane person wonders why we bother.  The easy way is much simpler,
	it's convenient, it means no struggling against the tide of mediocrity.
	It's depressing.

	To say that SCA is internally discriminatory and always will be is to
	betray the high ideals which we strive for, it means accepting
	injustice when it is really a very simple matter to change for the
	better.  But of course, maintaining the status quo is the easiest of
	all.  I refuse to accept the idea that skilled and chivalrous persons
	should not be recognized for their achievements.  Each of us does this
	because we like to do it, but we like doing it with people who
	appreciate it a lot more than we like doing it alone, or worse yet,
	doing it with people who disparge it. Part of being chivlarous means
	recognizing the achievements of others, even achievements in fields
	that do not particularly interest us.
	
	I personally like the idea of knighthood for archers and light

Master Kobayashi gives Greetings!

In digest #238, Don Leavy writes:
>It is rare that one gets to be a live lion...

But the whole point (for me, anyway) is that being a DEAD lion is just as
good!  If i end up surrounded by fifteen hostiles, i challenge them to
single combat.  If they accept, then i fight them one-on-one until one
side or another prevails.  If they don't, i fling myself into the fray and
almost certainly get trashed.   *In either case* i pop my helm, get a drink
of water, and soak up the accolades of the crowd.(see footnote)

You see, *i'm not really dead*, so it costs me *nothing* to behave in an
honorable fashion.  "What profitteth one to win in combat, if the crowd
thinks one is scum afterwards?" to paraphrase a famous philosopher.
Conversely, i have seen the *loser* of a fight get more attention and
praise than the "winner".  So how one feels compelled to behave in any
situation depends on what one is after, or, in gaming terms, how one defines
one's "victory conditions".

I realize that this is utterly tangential to Mr. Leavy's posting, but it
pushed one of my buttons.

to as "the Dream", i am,

In Digest 238, Baron Steffan (of the many initials :-) ) says something
to the effect of "I'm a lousy fighter and male, so I have no chance of
being King..."  -- my lady and I moved to Atlantia last summer from the
Middle Kingdom, and one of the things that happened as we were meeting
people is an attempt to bribe me to allow my lady to fight for someone
else in Crown Tourney.  It seems there is a Duke that would really like to
be King Consort...

Anyway, one of my dreams is to make my lady (currently a countess - Sir
Fern de la Foret) a Duchess, and then have her make me a Duke.  So, Steffan,
don't count out the possibility of a lady fighting for you in a Crown -
I suspect stranger things have happened!

Subject: knighthoods for all and sundry

could y'all give me a little clarification here?

Are we talking about archery, or combat golf-tubes?
assuming the former, what is it that archery and fencing have in common that 
makes them suitable basis for knighthood that is not equally true of any other 
thing that permits one to make an objective comparison between two 
participants e.g. spear wrestling, chess, tennis, or the construction of 
period engineering (bridges, siege weapons et al)?
When we say "honorable combat", do we mean honorable in an sca context (which 
fencing clearly is ) or in a period context (fencing was almost certainly no 
such thing), which reminds me ...

FLAME FLAME FLAME FLAME
	cavaliers, musketeers and the like are not only out of period, they 
are no more nescessary to period fencing than they are to dancing playford 
dances, in fact, less.  Huzzah the italian rennaissance!!
end flame

As to my own opinions...

surely a knight should excell at something...

and in favor of "protectionism":
i am not a knigt.  i am, however, a lady (i.e. person in sca with female 
persona), and as such it is my duty to observe and judge the chivalry of 
fighters.  This is not always easy.  for one thing, watching two anonimous 
tanks or heaps of carpet whack it out is boring boring boring, and watching 
two you know is only marginally more interesting (maybe we should encourage 
betting at tourneys more-it's period as all **).  And for anotherthing, if you 
dont fight (i don't), there are a whole lot of things you just can't tell.  
Which is why i'm collecting bits of metal and leather and building up my arm 
strength.  because its important. and if i *were* a knight, i think i might 
feel just a bit uneasy about someone being made a knight whom i ( or at least 
someone i knew, or even i knew someone who knew) had never faced through 
eyeslits.  A knight *should* fight heavy list.

Subject: sleeves of 1100

To the lady inquiring about sleeve styles of 1100:

I am not an authority on the subject, but I have been on a garb-making 
binge for several months now and I've picked up a few things in the 
process.  Those who are more knowledgable may feel free to correct me.

Sleeves in 1100 were cut straight out from the body, in the manner of 
that beloved classic, the T-tunic.  I don't think the set-in sleeve 
appears before 1300, and the tied-on sleeve is later still, in the 15th 
century.  If the material isn't wide enough to cut the sleeves in one 
piece with the body, then they are pieced on and the seam hidden with a 
band of embroidery.

		|    ||               ||    |
		+--------+         +--------+
		         |         |

The sleeves of the chemise are narrow at the wrist.  The sleeves of the 
gown may vary.  They may be wide and straight (as above), or very, very 
full and bell-shaped.  They may be long enough to drag on the ground, 
and can be tied up in knots to be stylish and to keep them from getting 
dirty.

Men's tunics also have something called a "rucked" sleeve, which is a 
narrow sleeve cut about twice as long as your arm and bunched up in 
gathers.  I don't know if this style was also used by women.

Subject: Roots and Perspective......

Finally, some documentation.  The issue under discussion is the
Non-European Thing everybody's been shrieking about.  My original idea
was to get at how persona perameters were defined at the first SCA
event in an effort to understand why Non-European's were around in
such profusion (also why we see so many European personas at SCA
events (curious, that)).  This is condensed in respect of Wm.  de
Corbie's 300 baud modem.  Therefore..... I am responding to the
following message:

>In article <8902011759.AA02113@vax.ftp.com> arnoff@VAX.FTP.COM (Michael 
>Greenberg) writes:
>>The first event (in Diana Listmaker's backyard) of the group who later became
>>known as the SCA, invited all participants to come in the dress of any 
>>period in which the primary weapon was the sword.  

The above is a small part of the original posting -- Arnoff

>     Excuse me M'Lord, it was an invitation to a going away party that said
>"please come in a fantasy costume....." (no mention of swords was made at
>any time). In fact, after talking with several of the participants, it seems
>the fighting that day was almost as a afterthought.....
>Just thought you'd like to know......
>Best,
>Arron Renyard

After diging a bit I secured Siefried von Hoeflichkeit's original
event announcement for the party which turned into the first SCA
event.  Participants were invited to take part in an "International
Tournament" (fighting was _not_ an afterthought, it seems), and were
encouraged to "wear the dress of some age of Christendom, Outremere or
Faerie in which swords were used."  In other words: folk from
Christian Lands, Other Lands (basically everywhere else) and Anywhere
You Can Think Of.  Pretty much covers it all.  Looks like swords were
mentioned too.  Oh, well.  

To recap my original point: The reason Euroes and Non-Euroes coexist
is because they were BOTH invited and made welcome from the begining.
We are talking about over 20 years of heritage here, recent (real
recent) BoD decisions not withstanding.  I feel it is rude to slam a
door in someone's face after they have been told to "make themselves
at home".  The non-European discussion is interesting, I would just
ask for a little more care when taking about who can be allowed.  A
lot of folks are getting insulted and that type of dis-courtesy is not
why I'm involved in the Society.  We all live here.  The Dream goes
beyond our clothes and our skins.

Anybody got some REAL commentary (that might have something to do with
my point)?

I remain,
Arnoff Ragnarsson

Subject:  Light Kbnights

Cocerning Knighting Archers, Lights and assorted other non-rattan fighters.
I am of two minds on this as it appears a lot of others are. My feelings as to
why they should not were not terribly clear, there are lights and archers who
desereve the respect and prestige that is accorded to knights. Yet I find that
the majority of my feelings tend to favor not opening knight status to them, I
also am against selecting a king by those methods. Perhaps if I explain my
reason for not wanting kings to be chosen by achers/light someone point out
fallacies or carry on that logic..
   Rattan fighting is peculier to our organization, there are very few people
outside of the Society who do Rattan fighting.  While there are large numbers
of people who use bows or fence. This is not terribly logical, and all it seems
to do is to make it more likely that person will have the "dream", that oft
used and misused idea that none of really seem to know what exactly it is, but
most of us want our kings and knights to have it. Now one of the best ways to
get people to realize the dream is for them to be involved in the Society for
long periods of time. It is theoretically possible for someone to come into
the SCA from a long tradition of bow use or fencing and become the best in the
kingdom in a very short time and to not have "the dream".
   Now as this argument doesn't really fit for knights, they are chosen by more
than simply fighting, they are chosen for exhibiting qualities we associate
with the dream. But this does give rise to annother possible argument against
light knights, in theory if a erson causes you grievence you could ask a knight
to challange the offending party on the field of honor, and if the knight felt
you were in the right the knight would do so, if the person the knight
challanges does not fight, or does not feel he would be able to give equitable
combat he can attempt to convince annopther knight to fight for him. If
light/archers were made knights than the knight would have to challange the
person in a specific weapon. Now the problem is that that logic carried further
could lead to highly ridiculous situations, because if light/archers, why not
dancers etc. and then there would be Dance offs or whatever.
   I realize this argument is excceingly weak, I don't even buy it myself. Can
anyone advance a better one? I still just do not feel terribly comfortable with
knights being made of light/archers.

Damn, I ment to include this in my last post but forgot. I wanted to mention
how the situation with Light knights was handled here in Ansteorra. The light
fighters (fencers only) have their own chivalry. They are called "Dons" and
wear a white scarf tied to one arm, thier squires wear red scarves. Not
fighting light nor being terribly interested in it I don't know a whole lot
about it and I amsure that there are others out there who know more or if there
are not I can find out more. But it has been my experiance that Dons are
treated with a great deal of repect.

Subject: crossbows
Message-ID:  <8902032340.aa26886@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

Several people wrote and asked me for information about crossbows after a
recent posting of mine.  Since there seems to be an interest, here's the info.

New World Arbalest
c/o David R. Watson
201 West Crestland
Austin, TX 78752
512-453-2628

David built my best bow for me.  It is an 11th century Viking crossbow with
stirrup.  It pulls about 75 pounds and delivers about 800 pound-inches of
power- good for target shooting and small game, but a little light for deer.  I
don't hunt at this time, but maybe in the future.  

The bow stock is solid mahogany, the prod is aluminum covered with rawhide
(I couldn't afford horn.)  The lock is also wood, and the fittingis are brass.  It
has no sight since the Vikings didn't use them.  It shoots very clean and strong
and acurate, and is a gorgeous piece of work.  Bow, spare string, 4 quarrels,
shipping and insurance cost $148.00-a very, very reasonable price, especially
compared to Barnett International.  David builds only reproduction of medeival
and Rennaissance bows, plus accessories.  He is the one who will build the
Chinese repeating crossbow for me when I get the money.

New Finsbury Fletchers
1300 W 24th  Apt 110
Austin, tx 78705


NFF supplies arrows, quarrels and strings to the traditional archer.  I bought
a dozen quarrels from him and am happy enough that I'm going to pay his high
price for a set of arrows for my husband.

Barnett International
PO BOX 934
Odessa, FL 33556
813-920-2241

Barnett is a modern manufacturer of crossbows and accessories.  I own a Trident
45, a pistol crossbow made by them.  It's a  fun little toy, and that's all it
is, in spite of Barnett's macho advertising.  With a 45 pound pull it delivers
about 270 pound inches of power, which is good for target shooting and not much
else.  They even sell a scope for it!!!!  But why you need a scope on a bow
who's optimum range is 10 yards is beyond me.  And considering most hunting is
done at a twenty yards, you don't need it for hunting either.  Barnett strikes
me as being a little out of touch with reality.

Barnett has  made one inovation that improves the art of the crossbow: A
revolving barrel that holds three quarrels, thereby enabling you to load and
fire more rapidly.  It's an ingenious little device.  Barnett does have some
useful accessories as well, such as weatherproof coverings for crossbows.

After having seen some of the big Barnett bows in shops, I've come to the
conclusion that crossbows, like many other old arts, are today a shadow of what
they were.  The use of modern materials has not really improved the bows.  Most
of the so-called improvements are gadgets, not truly useful devices.  For
serious shooting, I'm going to stick to my reproduction bows.  They, after all,
are the bows developed and used by poeple who staked their lives on them.  They
brought crossbows to their highest level of development, an expertise which was
lost and is slowly being rediscovered.

I am willing to answer any questions about crossbows, and to hear anything
anyone might have to say about them.  I would also like to find the gentleman who
built the Chinese repeating crossbows used by the Midrealm at the Pennsic War
several  years ago.

     Does anybody know of period food things, (travellable food, no
     preparation time required at the event) that a "food simpleton" such
     as myself could make to quell hungry gentiles?

I long ago formed the habit of bringing lunch unless the event announcement
said food would be available all day in such plenitude that we would have
to be rolled out the doors at the end.  Even food simpletons can make a
period lunch really easily.  Possibilities:
    fresh fruit, dried fruit
    bread -- buy unsliced if you can
    butter -- if you don't bring a cooler, cut a (wrapped) stick of butter
	in half & stick it open end down in a coffee mug
    honey, jam
    cheese
    hard sausage
    hard boiled eggs
    carrots

A small cooler can be very helpful, especially if it's an outside event on
a hot day.  Otherwise, pack your choices as well as you can into your
basket of feast gear.  If you don't have such a basket, i recommend
acquiring one; it helps keep your accidently squished apple and dirty plate
away from your best velevt gown....  I also find it useful to carry along a
small jug or skin of water, in case it is difficult or impractical to reach
the source of liquid refreshment at the site.

    A master at arms is someone who qualifies for knighthood but is
    unnable or unwilling to take the Oath of Fealty to the Crown.  A
    master at arms is distinguished by a white baldric and is called
    "Master Soandso".  He is a member of the chivalry, entitled to wear
    the gold chain and spurs...

I beg to differ about ONE point.  A Knight's chain is the symbol of his oath of
fealty, i.e. his obligation, to his King.  A Master at Arms can wear spurs, but
shouldn't wear a Chain.

>From Steffan ap Cennydd:
I was surprised to see some recent correspondence on republishing the Non-Euro
Debate in hardcopy. I've been posting info about the Philosophers' Academy
ffor a while now, and a summation of the debate would be perfect for our
proposed publication. Unfortunately, I don't have the capability to do it; but
if anyone out there is able and willing, I'd *LOVE* to publish it as part of
the Philo. Acad.'s activities.

Being still new to this, I've noticed that often I get through a long posting
without any idea of who the author is until the very end. Even then, I remain
curious as *where* the author is -- often "where you're coming from"
[literally] colors your perceptions. So I'd like to suggest the following

Subject: Constables, Trolls, and Gate Guards

Fr: Steffan ap Cennydd
"Constable" is an office in some kingdoms (mainly Occidental) that is sort of
a Security Officer. They run the "troll booth", keep the lost-&-found, tell
folks where they can and can't park or set up camp, and suchlike. The term is
a typical SCA poor choice. In the Middle Ages, the Constable was the head of
the Army -- what we in the SCA (at least, we in the East) call a "Warlord".
His second-in-command was the Earl Marshall. If we used Medieval terms aright,
the Society Marshall would be the Lord High Constable
and what we call Constables, Trolls, and Gate Guards would be called
"Warders".

Subject: Fencing Knighthoods

Heresy warning...a lot of folks won't want to have read this, but....
I'm troubled by folks who can't accept that the SCA is internally
discriminatory. That's life, guys, and it was certainly life in period.
I used to be upset about the unfairness of the Society.
Sure, I wanted to be a knight once (and those who have fought me are allowed
a guffaw-ing break at this point....) but I soon realized it would never
happen. I'm a lousy fighter and I'm male, so I have zero chance of being king.
I don't do any arts to speak of (well I *do*, actually, but not at
award-level...you know what I mean), so I'll never get an arts award. What I
do is strictly administrative & service-oriented. I've gotten every service
award from my baronial one & a neighboring barony's up to the Pelican, plus
the Queen's Order of Courtesy. I've been Ladies' Champion of my barony. This
is not bragging, it's just to point out that there's nothing else I can
possibly ever get...yet I'm still in this game. I would *LOVE* to be king, but
that just won't happen.
What's the point of this tirade? You don't get knighted for fencing, or for
arching. That's the way it is; that's the way it's always gonna be. The SCA is
not fair, nor does it have any reason to be. A lot of folks would do well to
mellow out and accept that.

Subject: weapons

Unto all the gentle fisher-folk Li Kung Lo sends his best regards. There have
been recent discussions and questionable statements regarding the carrying of
weapons in costume, either real or facsimile, vis-a-vis mundane law. For the
safety of all, I would like to share my limited, but valid experience. I am a
black belt in mundane martial arts, and have worked as a bodyguard and
bouncer.
        I am most familiar with the laws of New York and Massachusetts, but
they are representative enough to assure me that nothing is safe! I went from
Mass. to Florida to compete in the US Open in Karate (with assorted no-no`s)
and that was bad enough. Weapons, and the laws governing them, are up to the
jurisdiction of the various states, and subject to further revision and
modification (even contradiction, depending on your state constitution) by
local and municipal ordinances. If you think that wearing a costume grants you
some specific exemptions, think again and check local statutes!
        For instance, Mass. law prohibits any blade with a double edge, which
might include an ebony letter-opener. Please note that even if you have a
license to carry a gun, carrying such a blade would constitute a misdemeanor.
There are further specific laws controlling the ownership and transportation
of archery equipment/crossbows. In New York, they have a catch-all called the
Sullivan act, which prohibits carrying any object which is usable as a weapon!
In the broadest sense, this includes chopsticks, canes, peashooters,
umbrellas,and your Shadowmaker dagger. Although this law is usually invoked
only on a person already in the comission of a crime, if you get mugged in New
York, and drive your assailant off with an umbrella, it better not be on a
clear day! (unless, of course, local law provides for bumpershoot-bashing)
        In most cases, cops will be reasonable if you are in costume and being
peaceful, but there are several of us who have met the others. To be on the
safe side, don`t bear any weapon, real or simulated, in mundania (in some
places,carrying a thing that *looks* like a weapon is a specific crime).
Secondly, do check with the local constabularies where you live, or anywhere
you are holding an event.
                                        In Service to Staying out of Jail,
                                        Lord Li Kung Lo

Subject: Fencing and Chivalry

Fencing and Knighthood, hmm... Well, I can't pretend to have a totally
unbiased opinion on this one, but I do have a few things to say on the matter
(May the gods help us!). 

When I first joined the SCA, I was present at one of the beginners lectures
given by a Countess here in Carolingia. One of the things she mentioned
was Knighthood, and what it meant. To me, Knighthood has always meant
more than being able to hit someone over the head with a stick. It means,
as Sir Michael has already said, being exemplary in chivalry, in addition
to knowlege and competence in dance, heraldry... many arts and sciences.
I know of some fighters, perhaps very skilled in their art, who do not
fulfill the other requirements. I know of others, perhaps not as skilled,
who are more rounded. To me, the martial aspect of Knighthood is there
as a further display on the field of the qualities one should display off
the field. 

I must disagree with Sir Michael in another point, however, but first
we must determine the context in which heavy list is fought. Is it the
recreation of the "traditional" tournament? If so, then the point of
honor gained by the defense of one's home and people is not present. If
it is the recreation of actual battles (or the style, etc), then we are
fighting for our lives. I don't know of many people who, 
when faced with death, would not kick their opponent in the groin simply
because it is dishonorable. This is the old live jackal-dead lion deal.
It is rare that one gets to be a live lion in such cases.

As I understand things, period fencing is meant to recreate a number of
things. One is the Duel, which oftentimes is fought because of an affront
to one's honor. Another is the street brawl, which, though not the best
of situations, may cause one to defend oneself and one's own. In Carolingia,
we have the Baron's Guard, a group of fencers who swear, among other things,
to uphold and protect the baron, and to practice and promote chivalrous
behavior. Loyalty and honor; is this not what we look toward a knight to
display? 

I regret that I do not as of yet know much at all of SCA archery; perhaps
some king gentle would be able to fill me in. However, I'm not sure that
I can see where chivalry, honor, and the like are as readily displayed.
Would someone correct me?

The problem with fencers in the Knighthood is not at Kingdom level, but
at Corpora. In order to be a knight, one must be a heavy-list fighter.
Period, paragraph. This may be why there are so few squires who do not
fight rataan. Whether this should change may be an issue for greater minds
than mine. However, from my understanding, the ranking system was (among
other things) supposed to address this problem. The highest rank, that
of Don of Fence, seems to have been designed to be similar to Knighthood
in many respects. From reports I have heard, there were originally 
supposed to be three types of Dons: those awarded for teaching, those for
research, and those for skill. The award for skill seems to be closer to
the Order of the Tyger Combattant (all above are East Kingdom awards, by
the way). Perhaps the others have parallels in other awards as well?
Anyway, these three had eventually become rolled into one. There have
been disagreements with the system as a whole, but that doesn't enter
into this.

By the way, where is the chivalry in a cattle-raid? :-)
I appreciate your bearing with this entire diatribe; if you hadn't
you wouldn't be reading this now...

Subject: Chivalry for fencers (or no)

Chivalry is probably the greatest honour the Society can give anyone. As
far as I understand it has been given, on a few occasions, to people for quite 
other reasons than fighting. Apart from those it goes only (in theory, at 
least) to deserving lords and ladies who fight and act far beyond expectations.

So why dont we give this recognition to anyone that makes a comparable 
effort? My answer to that question is twofold: a pragmatical (not so nice) and
a philosophical (better). 

The pragmatical answer is that you can probably expect "protectionism". Some 
knights will be against it for various reasons. Other people will be against
it just because it is a change. This is not really a valid argument, but I 
think it will a serious problem encountered by anyone wishing for change in
this matter.

The philosophical answer is that of inflation. I fear that once the extension 
of chivalry to cover fencing and archery has been done, the award loses some
of glow or uniqeness. I also fear that other extensions may be argued if the 
first step is taken. In my view, the society will lose a part of its special
feeling in the process.

I feel that rather than doing this the best way recognise these efforts is
to add one or more new peerage level award. This would give the needed results
without changing the status of knighthood.

Subject: Should fencers be knighted?

In SCA Digest #231, Benjamin di Rosa of Aldea asked whether fencers should be
allowed in the order of chivalry.  I should preface my rely by stating that I
don't fence and that my knowledge of the Cavalier period is limited to "The
Three Musketeers" and "Cyrano", but fencing is a huge success in my shire and
my region -- I hope I've learned something by osmosis.

Anyway, I don't think fencers should be knighted.  Here's why:

1.  Fencing is not yet an accepted form of combat in all the Kingdoms.  (I
    thought I overheard someone saying that fencing is banned in the Midrealm --
    is this true?)  Fencers should have their own separate but equal honor, as
    a Sagittarius is to an archer.  (I know that if I were a knight who had
    taken up fencing, it wouldn't be such a great honor to be a knight again.
    It would be better to be recognized for having achieved something else.)

2.  It wouldn't work historically.  The King's musketeers (or guardsmen, or
    whatever) were a separate and distinct unit with a more domestic purpose.
    
3.  The aims of fencing are entirely different from those of rattan fighting.
    It strikes me as an "apples-and-oranges" problem to some degree.  How does
    one compare skill at dueling with fighting in a unit?  How would the
    chivalry fairly compare two candidates for knighthood when one is a very
    good fencer and the other is a very good fighter?

This should be a very interesting discussion; I expect comments from the East
to be thick and furious.  What goes on in the other Kingdoms, though?

Note: Our Crown Prince and Princess have decreed that they will choose three
kinds of champions: fighters, fencers, and archers.  I kinda like the concept
of three tourneys.  What do the rest of you think?

Subject: The Making of Rules

A brief response to Cher's article about fealty --

I'm glad to see that someone's been thinking about these problems with the
rules of the Society; there are times that it seems that the only way to
get the stupider regulations changed is to invoke the great demon, Mundane
Law.

However (to step onto *my* soapbox for a moment), this is also a good
illustration of the fact that the Society, in many cases, is a little too
rule-happy. I mean, this problem would not have arisen if such matters
were left to custom, as I believe they should be. Again, people in 
positions of power, *think* before you make a rule. Guidelines are better
than laws, and custom better than guidelines, in the vast majority of
situations. That way, when the inevitable exception comes up, you aren't
faced with a great house of cards that will collapse if you bow to that
exception...

        Does anybody know how to make leather shoes that don't begin to fall ap

 waterproofing stuff would do the trick.  (I have quite a bit of the latter, ha

 at all however if it would change the shoes in such a way as to render them no

Subject: how I met the SCA...

Greetings gentlefolk,

I am a relative newbie in the knowne world.  I attended a Pennsic about 
six or so years ago with some friends from Syracuse, had a great time, 
resolved to look up the local barony, and then pretty much forgot about it 
until this past summer.  Whilst perusing the net, I came upon an SCA 
notes file (bulletin board) and was suddenly seized with the urge to go 
to Pennsic again.  This time, I came back and have become a loyal 
subject of the barony of Carolingia.

Like many new persons, I have been in the throes of identity crisis 
about persona.  When planning my trip to Pennsic, I realized I was 
uncomfortable with the standard female gender role so I went as a nun, 
taking Hildegard von Bingen as my inspiration.  After three days in the 
VERY hot sun in a fairly authentic 12th century Benedictine BLACK garb, 
my vocation began to wilt.  I bought some cloth and stitched up a light 
overtunic to wear with my chemise.  With a piece of white veiling 
and a fillet, it was pretty reasonable 12th c. garb, although a bit too 
feminine for my tastes.  At one point I borrowed a doublet for court, 
rigged up some pants to look like venetians, and decided NOW I felt comfortable.
As the week wore on, I ended up making yet another tunic, wearing it with 
some loose mundane cotton pants I had worn on the way down, and buying 
one of those nifty leather belts so favored by fighter types.  Finally, 
women started to throw themselves at me, but by then it was time to
go home.  

My first thought on returning from the war was to create a "classic"
persona of the High Middle Ages, 12th c. Norman or thereabouts, and take 
up fighting.  (As a child, I always wanted to be Prince Valiant; I 
figured now was the time).  However, I have had a number of years 
as a mundane fencer and when I discovered the Carolingian Rapier Company 
it reawakened my passion for that art and I had to join.  Although the SCA 
isn't rigid about such things, I do feel silly fencing in a bliaut.  
It calls for doublets and lots of lace, so my garb has been getting 
progressively later and later period as I've shown up at baronial events.  
I still like the knightly simplicity of the 12th century, though.
I've decided I'm hopelessly anachronistic, and will just have to get 
used to being inconsistent.  

I've felt quite welcomed here in Carolingia, and would like to 
particularly thank Lord Danulf for helping me to get oriented, and the 
Carolingian Rapier Company for being such boon companions, in spite of 
my habit of injuring vital appendages in tourney.  We are gifted 
with a most gracious baron, and his lovely lady. 
Noble enemies, trusted friends, and beautiful lady to die for: 
what more could one want?

He is looking for sources for thigh high cavalier type boots to go with

He has found at least one source but is still looking.  (He considers
$800 a pair a bit on the expensive side.)

Subject: archers and knighthood?

I am also interested in Awilda Halfdane's comments:
>Historically speaking, more archers were knighted on the field of battle
>than women...
It was fascinating to see this after spending the weekend thinking and talking
about just this subject (archers becoming members of the chivalry) with some
of my friends.
One of my husband's squires was recently told that he needed to stop fighting
(except as a light in wars). However, he is an excellent archer. (Try open
division interkingdom #1 for 2nd year in a row). I'm told that archery is not
a Laurel-type activity because it's a war skill. I'm told that it is not
something which will result in knighthood because it's not heavy fighting. So
where does this gentleman fit?
He is a very chivalric person, as well as being interested in service and
trying out several different arts. However, he excells at archery. It seems
unfair to me that his skill slips through so many cracks in the SCA system.
(I'm sure he's not the only one, either.)
I'm not a fighter or a peer, but it's my opinion that someone with exceptional

Subject: Gate Guardians

I like the idea of calling the people who work the gate "gate guardians".
This expresses the idea that their function is to act as a guardian rather than
a guard or beastie which eats passersby (Troll).
In An Tir, this is one of the jobs which falls to our Constables. (Another is
as site patrol.)
We too have had difficulty with overly officious gate people. ("What do you mean
the gate is locked for the night! I've got to get this lady to the hospital!!"
was the response by an out-going gentle to one of those OO types once last
summer.)
I agree with Cher de Bellevue when she said:
>To explain: when people spend hours sitting out at the gate, sometimes in
>foul weather and/or a state of weariness, it's hard for them to remember to be
>courteous....
Our Kingdom Constables Office is working to improve the situation. They are
trying to provide them with a sleeping area nearby the gate so that if the
gate is quiet they can retire. They are encouraging having the Bardic Circle
nearby so that they are not isolated from the fun of going to events. They are
DIScouraging long martyr shifts and ENcouraging other members of the populous
to sit gate for short periods. (I'm proud to say that several of our busy peers
sit gate. This is STRONGLY encouraged. It sets a very good example.) They are
working on socializing those persons who like being on gate as a way of
wielding power. They are also preparing information to be placed in newsletters
to educate the populous.
Other constructive ideas will be cheerfully passed to our Constables Office and
greatly appreciated.
Some the problems which we have run into include site security and minors.
A couple of years ago a group of "locals" (definitely non-SCA) snuck onto
our site and carried off several coolers full of potables and food. Needless
to say, we've been a bit touchy about non-SCAers since. On sites which have
access other than the gate (most, that is) we have instituted site patrols.
Anyone else have this problem? Any solutions?
Our problem with minors has been mostly with unsupervised teens. They come
with friends (some of whom are technically adult) and are allowed and sometimes
even given off-limit potables. It is doubtful that their parents know their
whereabouts. Our response to this has been to check ID, and only allow minors
with waivers signed by their parents and accompanied by a responsible adult.
I've seen even NICE gate people grouched at because we have become strict about
this. (And, of course, cracking down on adults providing alcohol to minors has
made some people VERY angry.) I've heard via rumor that we are not alone in
this, but I'm really interested in solutions and suggestions.

I have just read a ringing critism on the style of arguments on the

tend towards silly, childish, and picky.  I can only remind him that
this is typical of usenet newsgroups and mailing lists in general.  In
fact, the arguments here tend to be a refreshing change from other
groups.  Never the less, we can still strive for more informed and
tolerant conversation.  This medium is not for making enemies; it is

Message-ID: <890202155008.49.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

Lord/Lady Malice (sorry, but your userid gives me no hint)

You asked about semi-divine kings. As you well know, the Roman Emperors
were divine. Being gods, they needed no other source of authority than
themselves. With Christianity, this was no longer possible, and so the
rulers became the chosen vicars of God. The "descending" theory of power
said that God had delegated his power to the king, who in his turn could
delegate it down to dukes, counts and others. This theory stems from the
conversion of the Roman Empire. In the west, the Pope took away some of 
the divine powers of the Kings, while in the east where they didn't recog-
nize the papacy, the Byzantine emperors ruled over the Church as well as
over secular society.
The pagan tribes in the early middle ages started out without kings. Their
tribal society had no central rulers. If there was a war, they would 
appoint a Duke (Heretoga) to lead the army. Later, and especially when
they were actively engaged in war for long periods, they acquired kings.
But as far as I know these were not regarded as divine.
I would be interested to learn if anyone has more information on the
ideology concerning the relations between the gods and the king in north-
European pagan societies.

Milord Michael Litchfield:
You asked if a Scottish persona in 1540 might plausibly have travelled
to Japan. The answer is YES, it is possible (though unlikely). As far
as I know, the first Portuguese ship arrived at Nagasaki in 1542. Only
the Portuguese sailed to Japan during the 16th century, with one known
exception: Mr Adams ("Blackthorne" in James Clavell's "Shogun") who 
arrived in the 1590's.
Travelling from Europe to India took 18 months in those days. Going
to Japan must reasonably have taken at least two years, probably more.

Knighthood for archers?
Archery was not what knights did in combat. It was for hunting only.
The archers that were used in battles were never knights or nobles.
They were yeomen of the peasant class, and I know of no instance
where one was knighted though it is not impossible that this happened.
The French cut off the fingers on captured English archers. Knights
despised all unmounted soldiers, especially in France.
If we want SCA knighthood to have some relation to medieval knighthood,
archery alone should not be sufficient as weapons skill for knighthood.
On the other hand, if SCA knighthood is simply a reward for good behavior
and skill at medieval arts of war, why not?

Subject:  A few legal facts we should all be made familiar with

Greetings!

A number of recent postings commenting on the diversity/non-Europeans issue
have included remarks which seem to be referring to the possibility of
discrimination, and the prevention thereof.  These remarks indicated, to me at
least, a lack of familiarity with mundane civil rights laws, particularly
those dealing with discrimination on any basis.  As I did considerable legal
research into this very topic as it related to the SCA less than a year ago,
and as I believe such knowledge important, I thought I'd set forth a few
facts.  I am neither agreeing with nor dis-agreeing with any of the opinions
expressed.  Neither am I criticizing anybody.  My intent here is only to
inform.  NOTE:  I ask the indulgence of our European members, as this may seem
somewhat irrelevant or confusing to them.

Besides which, I'll get to stand on one of my favorite soapboxes...  :-)

First:  if the articles of incorporation for the SCA state that it's focus is
on "pre-seventeenth century Western European culture," then the BoD would be
acting completely within the bounds of both its authority and the law if they
were to decide the non-Europeans had to go.  It is _not_ discriminatory to
adhere to your stated objective, and whatever rules have been laid down.
Thus, it's *not* true that no one can tell you what persona you can and cannot
be.  Potentially, the Board can.  (Thankfully, allowances have been made...)

As an example:  don't you think someone showing up at an American Civil War
re-enactment in a Napoleonic War era uniform would be told they were
unacceptably dressed?  And asked to correct the oversight, or leave?  Would
there be anything wrong with this?

Next:  what _would_ be discriminatory within this context would be the barring
of one gender (or religion, or race, etc.) or the other from some Society
activity.  Women cannot legally be kept from fighting; men cannot be barred
from doing embroidery.  Indeed, this aspect has lead to the elimination of
gender-specific language from Kingdom Law and _Corpora_.  That's why the terms
"Sovereign" and "Consort" are used.

As the genders are co-equal (same for religions, etc.) in the Society, this
sort of discrimination is not a problem.

Actually, one could make a case for what has been termed "reverse
discrimination."  For example, sometimes there seems to me to be a tendency
towards an attitude of letting the lady off lightly, or "the Sovereign takes
the heat." In other words, the Crown screws up somehow, and the King
(generally the Sovereign) takes the fall.  In my opinion, if the Crown must
act as one, and with equal authority, then the Crown must share equal
responsibility.  But, that's just my opinion.

The area which the Society need most concern itself with respect to potential
discrimination/civil rights violations appears to be that of fealty, and oaths
of fealty.  This is also one of the most mis-understood topics the scope of
the SCA touches upon.

To make myself clear about this, I must offer at this point some simplified
*legal* definitions (not necessarily the same as what one would find in
_Webster's_).  My source was _Black's_Dictionary_of_Law_Terms_.  Legally, to
*swear* is to take an oath.  An *oath* specifically invokes a Deity, generally
recognized as the Christian concept of God.  *Fealty* involves land and the
attendant duties of holding it, and comes from the medieval "feal and leal."
(Sorry, but that's a tough one to deal with, and I may have over-simplified.)

Now:  many individuals (including observant Jews, Quakers, and others) cannot
swear or otherwise take an oath, nor otherwise acknowledge the Crown as
anything except the "head of government."  This is why even the Constitution
of the US states as that the President shall "swear or affirm" the "oath or
affirmation."  An affirmation is an oath without the invocation of a Deity,
and is equally binding.  This is also why we have Masters-at-Arms in the
Society (apart from the similar needs of those in the military).  Legally, no
one can be *required* to take an oath of fealty, as opposed to an affirmation
of allegiance. To do so would be to violate freedom of religion (for openers).
*Both* must be equally acceptable, and Kingdom Laws should really be phrased
in such a manner as to reflect this.

Those who are most affected by this situation are actually the Landed Barons
and Baronesses.  A number of Kingdoms have laws *requiring* an oath of fealty,
period.  Personally, I think that's damn dangerous, and have so advised the
BoD.  All it would take would be one Royal Jerk pushing the issue, and then we
would all have hell to pay!

Let me illustrate:  the lady who reigned as Baroness Wyvernwoode here in
Trimaris until this past October is an observant Jew.  Trimarian Kingdom Law
was phrased in such a manner as to require an oath of fealty, with no room to
maneuver.  Had the incoming Crown not accepted her affirmation of allegiance,
Her Excellency could have taken them right to court-- the mundane kind!

It seems to me that it would be a damn sight smarter and safer if *all* rules
and regulations of *any* kind involving swearing, oaths, fealty, whatever were
required to be phrased "shall swear or affirm their fealty or allegiance."  Or
something close to that.  That's actually all we need to do to protect the SCA
in most instances:  leave room for compromise.  Coercion leads to trouble, and
is frequently illegal as well!

Also for the record:  there was a *lot* more information to be considered with
respct to this issue than what I've included here.   But, hey:  what I sent to
the BoD last fall was something like 8 or 10 typewritten pages long.  So, I've
done the best I can, while hopefully getting the meaning and intent of these
laws across.

Finally:  as can be seen in the preview of the '89 _Corpora_ in the most
recent _TI_, the only time knights were ever meant to swear fealty was at the
time of knighting.  The old _Corpora_ said, "a knight candidate must be
prepared" to swear fealty.  That clause has often been mis-quoted and mis-
interpreted.  It was used to require oaths of fealty be renewed with every
reign in some Kingdoms, and as a springboard for the writing of some of the
laws concerning Landed Barons and Baronesses.  Simultaneously, the existance
of MSCA's were what protected them from dealing with this issue, and solved
the problem.  Thankfully, the new _Corpora_ will clarify the issue with
respect to the knights.  I am awaiting the draft of the new _Corpora_ (did
*you* order *yours?*), and am curious to see if there has been any
clarification or change regarding Landed Barons and Baronesses.

I hope those reading this have found it informative and helpful.  I also
apologize in advance for any inadvertent mistakes or oversights.

                                   In Service,

Milord Arnoff Ragnarsson:

You say that the discussion about non-European personas has been 
insulting and rude.

First. I want to say that if anyone has felt insulted by anything I have
written, will that person *please* write to me and tell me so. You will
receive a written apology, in calligraphy if you want. Unforgiven sins
really bug me.

Second, I don't agree that the discussion as such has been insulting or
rude. I believe that you, milord Arnoff, are committing a logical fallacy
when you fail to make a distinction between (a.) personas, and (b.) those
who have personas.

It would certainly be rude and insulting if someone had said that Chinese
or Indians weren't welcome in the SCA. It is an entirely different thing
to question wether it is appropriate to let people choose Chinese or Indian
personas. The latter is a question about the nature of the "Middle Ages"
in the SCA - not about who is welcome or who is not.

Nobody has suggested that those who have non-European personas have broken
any rules, or that their work is worth less than that of others. But they
have chosen their personas freely, and we must certainly be allowed to 
question which personas the system should allow people to choose. It must
be possible to talk about how appropriate any persona is, without any
negative feelings toward the excellent lords/ladies in question. They
haven't done anything wrong! They have only used their rights under the
present system, and I truly hope that this has been clear to everyone.

And please! Regardless of my opinions about the Age of Chivalry and all
that, I would not dream of asking master Kobayashi, who truly *is* Japanese,
to change *his* persona.

Yours,

Myself and a friend (Hi, Nicolette!)  have decided to join the ranks of
heavy listers, collecting our armor piece by piece, building up are strength,
building up pells, and so on.  I have noticed postings from time to time
on the Rialto from women who have been fighting for some time.  There are not
many active women fighters in our area--any advice?  Have you found there
are no real differences in styles used or have you learned variations that
are of use?  Do you prefer lighter armor or metal?  What's the consensus??

Subject: Roots and Perspective....

The first event (in Diana Listmaker's backyard) of the group who later became 
known as the SCA, invited all participants to come in the dress of any 
period in which the primary weapon was the sword.  I believe that the
announcement said nothing about Europe, India, Africa, Japan, Russia, China,
Mongolia, etc., etc.....  The Western Europe definitions are quite recent,
but to find the heritage and tradition of the Society you have to go all the
way back to the original definitions.  If you wonder why you are up to your
eyeballs in Vikings, Mongols, Samurai, Celts, Late Period Folk and Early
Period Folk this might be the reason.  It also might be the reason why they
all think they belong.  In the begining, they all did.  Just because <your
name here if you want it here> don't feel they do doesn't change the fact
of the Society's roots.  As in any age, you can't just change established
heratige (a couple of decades worth in this case) with a decision or re-
definition.  The non-European Persona discussion, while interesting at times,
have been insulting a lot of people who have understood for years that they
been invited and were welcome.  I personally find that rude.  The courteous
Mandarin is more important to me (and represents more of what the Society
and the Dream means to me) than a dis-courteous 14th century Italian.  That
is my personal perspective.

Subject: Arguments on SCA-Net

FLAME WARNING **** FLAME WARNING **** FLAME WARNING **** FLAME WARNING

Greetings...

    Although the arguments presented on this list have value, some  of
the ways in which they are presented are at odds with the fact that we
are all supposed to be "gentles".  Some of the  "arguments"  presented
by  certain  posters  do  not actually address the issues at hand, but
instead attack the holders of  the  opposite  viewpoints,  or  include
material  which  does  not  have  any  bearing  on the validity of the
opposite viewpoints.

    For example,  the  "ad hominum"  fallacy  of  calling  the  Secret
Society  a  "high school mentality":  if the Secret Society is a "bad"
idea, there's no reason to insult its proponents.  As another  example
of  this,  I  seem to recall someone saying something to the effect of
"of course Lord X is in  favor  of  non-European  personae;  he's  one
himself".   The  fact  that  he  may have a "vested interest" does not
automatically render his arguments invalid.

    Another  fallacy  perpetrated  is  the  "Bandwagon  Fallacy",  for
example:   "Most people accept non-European personae, so learn to live
with it".  If nobody complains about an issue, does that automatically
make it acceptable?

    There is also no call to include emotionally-charged or  offending
statements  in  the  arguments, viz. statements like "This is the SCA,
not the KKK".  The argument in which that  line  was  contained  would
have  made  its  point  just  as effectively if that line had not been
present; was it *really* necessary to the argument?

    It is true that each person's Dream is  different.   Some  gentles
are members of the SCA merely to have fun.  Some wish to re-create the
Middle Ages as closely as possible.  Others are aware that there  *is*
a  middle  ground,  and  are content to follow their own Dream without
imposing too much on anyone else's.

    But if you *must* persuade someone else that your Dream is  better
than  their Dream, is it necessary to badger, belittle, or offend them
in the course of it?

    Please excuse me if my own posting has offended anyone; the intent
was  not  to offend.  I merely ask, "If we are supposed to be gentles,
can we not at least *act* as such?"

Subject: non-rattan knights
Message-ID: <890201230727.20.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

We should remember that the SCA interpretation of knighthood is only loosely
modelled on the real Middle Ages. It also has strong influences from the
Victorian romantic image of knighthood. Some might say that we are even 
more Victorian than medieval.

A brief look at knighthood in the Middle Ages: Early medieval knighthood
was more or less automatic for sons of noblemen. When they became adults,
they were dubbed knights. Later, knighthood grew in importance and had
to be earned in some way. Often, a young man would be knighted after his
first battle. Any knight could create another knight.

It wasn't until the high Middle Ages that the Kings took over the right
to create knights. This was of course an important instrument of power,
in a society where knightly status determined a lot of your rights and
privileges. Gradually, knighthood became more and more exclusive. In the
15th century, the knights were an elite of noblemen, and towards the end
of the Middle Ages knighthood had become a reward for services. The feudal
idea of military service was no longer the same: knights would pay money
to their lords instead of serving. The king would use the money to pay
mercenaries.

The introduction of different Orders of Knighthood also made it visible
that there were different strata within the knightly ranks: the orders
had different status, and being a member of an order was a higher status
than being just a knight ("knight bachelor"). These orders were another
way for the king to get more control

Now, about the SCA: Since the SCA is not trying to re-create any specific
point in time or space, and since our knighthood is a reward for skills
at arms and chivalric behavior, I see no reason to limit it to rattan only.
If we allow rapier fencing and shinai and other forms of combat, we should
be prepared to recognize knightly qualities in such fighters as well.
Personally, I would prefer a Society without rapiers etcetera. In my
opinion, the Middle Ages ended around 1500, not 1600. But as long as
cavaliers are allowed in the SCA, they should be allowed to become knights
while fighting in a way that suits their personas.

By the way, is there a Japanese equivalent of knighthood? Perhaps
Samurai personas should be dubbed "Hatamoto" instead of knights?

My brain sometimes moves slowly, but it does eventually move.  

The solution to the problem of how to recognize archers and fencers a has
already been (obliquely) addressed by the Middle Kingdom.  In the Midrealm
there are two ways to be a member of the chivalry: knight and master at arms.
A master at arms is someone who qualifies for knighthood but is unnable or
unwilling to take the Oath of Fealty to the Crown.  A master at arms is
distinguished by a white baldric and is called "Master  Soandso".  He is a
member of the chivalry, entitled to wear the gold chain and spurs, and to fight
in Crown Tourney.  The only difference is that a master at arms cannot make a
knight, only a knight may make a knight.  In this way the title "sir" is
reserved for fighters that conform to the Age of Chivalry ideal of knighthood,
but equal respect is given to those that don't.  As I recall, some Oriental
personas have elected to be masters at arms rather than knights because they felt
their loyalty was due first to their Emporer, and that therefore they could not
in good faith swear loyalty to the king.  On the other hand, if the two orders
are exactly alike, and a candidate is willing to swear the oath, then he ought
to be a made a knight.

Subject: Before we change the subject

We're getting an increasing number of posters asking that the subject of
non-European personas be shelved.  The fascination which the subject holds for
us may be seen by the proportion of these posters who then, more or less
apologetically, then proceed to add their own last words to the discussion.

Yes, it is an interesting discussion.  A lot of thought has gone into it and
much that is though provoking has come out of it, and it would probably be of
interest to a much wider audience.

Would someone who has been involved in this discussion be willing to volunteer
to condense the debate into a single article (or alternatively, would two people
be willing to condense the debate into two articles, one pro and one con)?  Such
an article would merit a wider distribution than the debate has had, and I for
one would like to see it.

Volunteers?

Firebrand to Seedling:
Lady Orianna, could you please post the current membership & subscription
prices for The Heraldry Society. I used to belong years ago but have let it
lapse. It was fascinating and very worthwhile, and I encourage all heralds to
look into it. I'm also very anxious to take their Diploma exam (which I
believe is in March...oh, well.). Also, do they have an airmail option? My
Coat of Arms magazines used to take several months to get here from England.
Thanks.

To Justin, William de Corbie, et al....
Yes, you're right, Justin. This has been going on in circles for too long.
People (including myself, heaven knows!) have been attacking it from the wrong
angles.
William, you found the right angle with your discussion of the SCA as a unique
culture unto itself. That is, in fact, the incipient Philosophers' Academy
"theme" for this year. Please, write down your thoughts on this subject and
send them to me at:

There is no "Dream". Everyone has his own idea of what the SCA is for. You're
not going to trade in your dream for mine, and vice versa. The SCA *itself*
should have decided why it's here long ago, but it never has and never will.
And if you think the Articles of Incorporation represent that decision, you're
wrong -- the only thing that the SCA's membership agrees on is that the
Articles of Incorporation are a ridiculous joke that have never remotley
resembled reality.

Subject: archers and knighthood?

In Digest #233, Awilda Halfdane writes, among other things:
> Historically speaking, more archers were knighted on the field of battle

Could we have some documentation for this?  I'm sure I'll be corrected if
I'm wrong :-) but wasn't archery viewed as an unchivalrous mode of combat?
Effective, yes, but not the "right" way to do battle?

I haven't done any research on this at all, but on first thought, it seems
unlikely to me that anyone would be honored by knighthood for excellence in
fighting unchivalrously...  (No flames from SCA archers please - I'm
guessing at history, not suggesting that SCA archers are "bad guys")

Subject: Republishing Articles

This is particularly directed at Dame Enid, but there may be others interested
in it, so I am posting it here --

We hashed out the issue of republishing articles from here to newsletters
quite some time ago, in the early days of this Digest. The concensus reached
was pretty much this: *most* people are willing to have their stuff
republished at will, but there are some who feel uncomfortable about it.
Legally, articles published on the Net are in Limbo: some legal experts
argue that they are automatically public domain, others claim that they
are automatically copyright. Since this is hazy, and simply as a matter of
politeness, you should ask permission of the person who wrote the article
before you republish it. All articles have an address line for their authors;
in most cases, this address works pretty well. If you are having trouble
getting through to a person, write to me; as keeper of the Rolls, I'm 
getting fairly expert at finding paths to people...

(And everyone get your Rolls entries to me; I plan to "go to press" in a week
or two...)

Respectfully, I think that there should be a difference made here between 
"poisonous" and "safe."  Young nasturtium pods have traditionally been used 
pickled like capers in northern climates (I'm not sure how far back...).  And 
wormwood is legally sold in small quantities in herbal teas in this country.
In small doses, it is a stimulant and an appetite supressant. (On the other
hand, in small doses, strychnine is a stimulant and a tonic--but I wouldn't
recommend trying either of them without supervision...!:-)  Wormwood is also
used as a flavoring in many modern (and traditional) liqueurs and syrups, such
as benedictine, chartreuse, and campari. 

On the other hand, I would point out that wormwood is no more poisonous in 
small quantities than an equal amount of mace (the outer shell of the nutmeg), 
which will cause stomach cramps (or convulsions) and delirium, and if enough 
is given, will lead to respiratory arrest and death.  On the *other* other
hand, who is going to want to eat a tablespoon or more of either?

Subject: re: one last word

i had not dreamed it would ever be necessary to say this, but i guess it is, 
so here goes:

A person's mundane race, creed, gender, sexual preference, and country of 
national origen have *absolutely nothing* to do with what he/she can or cannot
do or be in the sca.  Neither does his/her affiliation to any other group, nor 
his/her history of drug use. Neither does his/her typing speed, cup size, or 
political opinions.
Ones activities +/or persona within the sca are limited by the era that the 
sca tries to recreate:  the middle ages and renassance.  That is the only 
restriction the sca request of the people that attend its events. ( Some people 
choose varient definitions of the "middle ages", and we get oriental personae 
and cavaliers; some people choose to ignore the subject completely and we get 
elves, darkoverians, and self-styled barbarians.  These people are collectively 
deplored by the purists and individually appreciated by all for their
 individual contributions to the sca.  that is an entierly different issue.)

we are trying to recreate a predominantly male, catholic, western european
society/phenomnenon but we do not require anyone to mundanely male, catholic, 
or western european to participate.

YOU CAN BE ANYTHING YOU CAN DOCCUMENT and somethings you cant.
you can be male or female, rich or poor, noble, bourgois, or peasant, saxon or 
moor, catholic, jew, evil magian fireworshiper, fighter, merchant, monk, ships 
captain, cook, fool, alchemist.  you can choose to make your natural 
strengths/weeknesses/differences part of your persona, or you can not.  You 
are not required to make your persona explain what you looklike, what you 
wear, or what you do.  You are'nt even required to have a persona  

ALL WE ASK FOR IS "A REASONABLE ATTEMPT AT PERIOD GARB"

I have never heard or heard of anyone saying anything otherwise, ever.

Subject: knighthood follow-up

Gentle readers - I take once again keyboard to my fingers to make a
few addendums to my missive of a few days ago on this Rialto.  Certain
other notes in this forum and a note from a reader and one from my lady
have reminded me of other thoughts I wish to share with those who wish 
to read them.

First of all, I did not read the original base note that discussed
archery as a basis for knighthood when I posted my original missive.
The Rialto missives seem to arrive at my location in a somewhat
different order than perhaps they were written (or perhaps I've just
managed to read them in the wrong order... whatever).

My original note was not meant in any fashion to disregard or downplay
archers as potential candidates for knighthood.  Quite the opposite, I
believe that any honorable medieval combat form could and would suffice
for the martial aspects of elevation to knighthood.  I do believe that
in the Period of the SCA, martial abilities are a necessary element
before one can be elevated to knighthood.  It is only later that
scientists and statesmen are made knights without martial skills.  It
is important to note though that those people were outstanding examples
of the roles which a knight is supposed to play - champion, protector,
courtesy, chivalry, et cetera.  I, personally, would have no problem
with making non-fighters into SCA knights if they were so clearly
outstanding as to merit such an award.  I would imagine, however, this
viewpoint would be controversial among many readers here, or to Those
Who Decide Such Things.

Secondly, the comment I made about knights being protectors, champions,
et cetera is in my opinion the real reason why people flinch so badly
when a knight behaves badly, or when a boor is elevated to knighthood.
Now, please, I am not describing any specific person or event, please
do not construe my remarks as any kind of criticism of people you know
or have heard of.  Truely, if I wished to make a personal remark or
veiled attack, I would and could, even in this public forum.  Please
accept my assurance that I am not doing so.

However, my point is especially important here in this discussion - If
a person that you look up to, or you respect or you have pledged great
loyalty to behaves in a particularly offensive manner, your faith in
that person and the office or group that they belong to is shaken.
People have come to me to explain what they thought was horrific
behaviour or have been shaken by what they have seen and they are angry
that someone they have held in such high esteem should behave thusly.

I agree.  

Knights and other people in responsible leadership positions should
hold themselves to a higher standard of conduct as much as possible.
(And no, I don't think I will make any statement, comparison, witty
remark, etc about the current American political situation with respect 
to this principle which I have just stated... :-)

My only response in such situations is to try to learn how much is
fact, how much is theory, how much is rumour, and how much is
fabrication.  Only once have you done that can you be in a position to
have a well-informed opinion.  Note that word --> opinion <-- .

One of the most pleasurably moving aspects of having been made knight
was the dawning sense of responsibility I have to my fellow person,
especially in the SCA.  Knights are expected to behave better, know
more, be more polite and more courteous, etcetera.  If you don't think
this is hard, think again - somehow, a knight isn't even allowed to
lose their temper, because everyone looks at a knight as an ideal, a
model, almost a perfection of an idea.  Personally, I enjoy the
challenge of living up to these responsibilities, and I try to make
people remember that living up to the ideal can be done with a sense of
fun, pleasure, and enjoyment which comes from associating with a lot of
really nice people.

Well - it's dinner time for me, so off to the feeding trough.

Subject: The Letter of Dance -- Call for Articles

Well, things are coming along nicely, so it's time to make my first
large-scale request for articles for the Letter of Dance! The first
issue will be coming out in mid-July, so I'd like to have articles
for that issue in by the first of May. I hope that, by giving people
a full four months' notice, I'll get a reasonable number of articles.

Below, you will find the initial policies and guidelines for the
Letter. Show it around to your local Dancemistress, Master of A&S,
and/or anyone who think might be interested in talking about Dance.

Thanks, one and all, for your help in getting this off the ground!

					-- Justin du Coeur

Copyright policies for the Letter of Dance:
 
Submission of copyrighted articles are *verboten*, unless there is 
very clear permission to do so. In general, don't even bother unless
you wrote the article, and possess the copyright for it.
 
Music is a somewhat harder issue. I would like to get sheet music, or
at least the melody line, to go with dances that are submitted. If
possible, send a copy of the original, or transcribe it yourself. Do 
not submit full scores to things unless: a) you wrote it yourself, or 
b) it was in the original. In general, I think we may assume that full 
scores are based upon the original, but are recent adaptations and still
under copyright. Besides, scores take a lot of room, which a melody
line probably doesn't.
 
Even harder is the matter of played music. Once a year, I intend to
publish a tape of recordings of the music to the dances described in
the past year. Unfortunately, most recordings of this music are
commercial, and I *will* *not* copy commercial recordings. If you know
of a small-run recording of the music to the dance, tell me about it,
and I may be able to work something out with the owners of the
copyrights. If you know people who might be willing to perform some
music for the tape, *talk to me*; I need people who can do this.

Submission policies for the Letter of Dance:
 
There are three main sorts of entries that I am looking for in the Letter.
The first is articles about dance or related subjects. This can cover
almost anything, but if you're planning on going *way* afield, I strongly
advise talking to me about it in advance. Odds are that I'll say, "Sure,
that sounds interesting," but it's a good idea to run the project past
me first. These articles should be of a moderate length (up to, say, three
computer-pages single-spaced) or should be splittable into a serial
format. The style shouldn't be *too* dry; the Letter is aimed largely
at the layman, rather than the heavy-duty academician.
 
The second sort of article is a description of a dance. This should be
done in *great* depth; try to assume nothing. Include at least a thorough
description of the pattern and steps of the dance, as well as any other
notes that you would find useful if you were being taught the dance.
Other things to send are: some history of the dance; the original source
of the dance; where you learned it from; the music to the dance, either
recorded or written (see Copyright Policies); style pointers; and anything
else that you think might be relevant. Assume that most of the people
reading this are going to be completely unfamiliar with not only the
dance, but with the entire family of dances that this one comes from.
 
Both of the above forms are going to be "lightly" juried. That is to say,
there will be a jury examining the articles for real errors or
misjudgements in them. This will not be a rigorous, academic-style
jurying; I expect most articles to get through with nothing more than
a comment or two. If I feel that the comments from the jury warrant it,
I may send the article back with some suggestions for improving it.
Also, I will be examining each article before passing it on to the
jury to make sure that it follows the basic guidelines set forth above.
If you disagree with the jury over their comments, and I think that your
arguments have some weight, or if I feel that the comments from the jury
are rather minor, I may simply run the article, along with the comments
on it. IF YOU OBJECT to having jury comments run along with the article,
say so up front, and I will make sure that the form that runs is
acceptable to everyone. Don't worry about the jury too much; any 
moderately well-researched and/or well-thought-out article should get 
through with no troubles.
 
The third form of submission is letters. I intend the Letter to have an
active and vocal letter column. This is where we can have the long
arguments about dance that the Net won't tolerate for any great length
of time. Anything and everything goes here, as long as it is polite
(no flame wars permitted), well-reasoned (as opposed to necessarily
correct), and non-repetitive. The main reasons that I might bounce a
letter are rudeness or a plethora of letters saying the same thing.
I reserve the right to edit letters for space, but promise to do my
best to preserve the spirit of the letters. If you don't want your
letter to be edited at all, say so, and I won't.
 
There are two ways to submit articles to the Letter. First, you can
mail it, via the USNail. I recommend this for anything that might
contain illustrations, for the obvious reason that netmail doesn't
do pictures in any consistent way. The address for mail submissions
is:
 
                The Letter of Dance
                c/o Mark Waks
                82 Montclair Ave.
                Waltham, MA 02154
 
Second, you can e-mail submissions to me. This is particularly good
for letters, as well as articles that have no illustrations or music.
In these cases, e-mail is actually preferred. My net address is:
 
                justin@inmet.inmet.com
                        or
                uunet!inmet!justin
 
Electronic submissions *must* be in pure ASCII, with no funny editor
controls. For the moment, the Letter is being kept in ASCII files,
and it is the only format that I can safely assume that whatever
publishing package I eventually wind up with will support.
 
All submissions should be accompanied by whatever biographical
information you wish to have printed. I intend to have a page of
contributor information (a la TI). Recommended information includes:
SCA & Mundane names; group that you are in (at least kingdom); a *brief*
persona extract; awards & titles that you feel are relevant. This should
be no more that a paragraph total. All of this is strictly optional,
but I would like to at least know what kingdom you are from, so that
we may compare and contrast how things are done across that Known World.

Subject: Gate Guardians

To start with, I like that title; it has a little more spark of reality
than "trolls".

We probably don't face the same problems with Gate Guards here in Carolingia
that you do down in Trimaris; here, camping events are few and far between
(one per year, max), which means that people aren't on Guard duty for anywhere
near as long as they are down there.

Given this near-vacuum of information, I'll venture this opinion: the people
who really need to be made aware of this problem are the autocrats. In most
of our events, we have a "head troll", who is entirely in charge of running
the gate. This person ought to make sure that: there are *enough* gatekeepers
to make for some conversation; they are supplied with, say, some games to keep
them awake on those long third-shift stretches; they are kept in water and
Gatorjuice (anachronistic but effective) for the hot midday spells; and they
get the occasional grateful pep-talk (nothing makes someone feel better than
being told that they're doing a good job). These may not entirely solve the
problem, but they ought to help quite a bit.

Subject: apology

in my last posting i attacked several persons arguments point-by point instead 
of trying to reason against the substance of their arguments.  This was wrong, 
i have no excuse for it, and i would like to apologise to all those whose time 
and space i wasted, and especially to those gentles whose words i used blindly 
without taking the effort to reason with the point they were making.  I am 
sorry.  

Everyone has a different set (often fuzzy) of what they consider "acceptable" 
and what they consider not for sca use.  Knowing what these are for oneself 
can be very interesting, hearing what other's are (especially if they know 
*why*, which one doesn't always) can shed light on ones own opinions and help 
de-fuzz one's own set.  I think we can let the subject of non-european garb 
rest for a while, but i would like to hear more on what other people/groups 
consider o.k. and not o.k.   e.g. from my own personal wearhouse:  zippers are 
out, but machine buttonholes are in;  coke cans are out, but avaiator glasses 
are o.k.  etc.

Milord Benjamin,

 I applaud you, sir.  Knighthoods for non-heavy weapons fighters are an
 excellent idea.  Fencers and archers are currently fighting for personal pride
 and not much else, but they as much as the heavy fighters, uphold the honor of
 their respective kingdoms and the SCA.  Archery even comprises a war point at
 Pennsic and elsewhere.  Plus there's the IKAC, and various archery
 tournaments, plus archery was an integral part of the Age of Chivalry which
 some people claim is the be all and end all of the SCA.  Historically
 speaking, a lot more archers were knighted on the field of battle than women.
 We ought to give _all_ our fighters a chance for recognition with the
 accolade. Each of us dares Dream that some day we will be found worthy of the
 white belt, but at the moment a good many of us are barred from the chance of
 it ever happening just because we play with little sticks instead of big
 sticks.

Well, everybody, if we all like non-Europeans so much, why don't we do
something about it?  Instead of badgering poor William anymore, why don't we make
up a new game?  I propose formation of the Asian African History Society in
complement to the Society for Creative Anachronism.   I propose further that it
should be a separate and distinct organization from the SCA with its own bureaucracy
and rules about how the game is played, but that it should work out reciprocating
agreement for the SCA so that, for example, people authorized to fight in one

"Among the most revealing and deservedly renowned documents in the
history of medieval art is Bernard of Clairvaux's letter to the abbot
of Saint-Thierry denouncing the unseemly exuberance of early twelfth-
century Cluniac art. The violence of reaction elicited in a man reputedly
oblivious to his physical surroundings was only partially motivated by
principles of Cistercian ascetism. His vitriolic condemnation of 'those
unclean apes...those half-men...those fighting knights...those hunters
winding their horns' was a protest against both the distractive influence
and the extravagance of this type of ornament. It is also a confirmation
of the strong appeal of such representations even to a 'reluctant' observer."

So begins a marvellous book which a friend of mine, the learned Ulfr Thunthar,
recently unearthed in the Uppsala University Library. The book is called
"IMAGES IN THE MARGINS OF GOTHIC MANUSCRIPTS", a title which pretty well
sums up what the book is about. Here we meet all those small, more or
less weird pictures of men and beasts which illuminate the borders of
early medieval manuscripts. This book is a treasure-trove for all calligraphers
and illuminators.

Regrettably, the photos are black-and-white. But there are 739 pictures!
All of them with complete source listings and analysis.

Subject: knighthood for fencers - one person's opinion

As a knight of the Eastern Realm, and as an SCA fencer for about a
year, I (along with only a very few others) have the dubious honor of
being refered to as a "fencing knight" (and my poor squire was recently
referred to as "the fencing squire" by people who should know better).
In response to previous notes on knighthood for fencers, I have put
down a few of my thoughts for those who care to listen.  I beg the
indulgence of readers who don't want to read this stuff - you should
please skip to the next missive in this Rialto.

I don't think I was made a knight strictly for my rattan fighting
ability, because I was never that good, and my fighting ability dropped
off rapidly after an injury sustained fairly early in my fighting
career (before I was made a knight).  I do assume that my fighting
ability was sufficiently good to make me noticable to Those Who Decide
Such Things, after which I was examined for all the other elements
which are required for knighthood (chivalry, honesty, courtesy,
throrough knowledge of the arts and some of the sciences of the
medieval period, etc, etc...).  Happily I was approved of by TWDST, 
and here we are.

I was around when the OTC was created.  Its intent was to recognize
fighting prowess and mastery of/introduction of significant new
fighting styles and skills.  That's it.  Knighthood is something
significantly more.  In my mind, knighthood represents the belief on
the part of the person doing the knighting (the king in consultation
with the knights) that the person being knighted has a significant
personal committment to the ideals which form the heart of the SCA
(what some people call "the dream").  At the time I was knighted, the
description was "exemplary of the qualities of a medieval knight".  I
prefer to think of those qualities as the heart of what makes the SCA a
unique place - the courtesy, the chivalry, the openness, the
helpfulness and the acceptance of others which is so often lacking in
parts of the mundane world which we live in.  Hopefully everyone in the
SCA has these characteristics, but knights should be EXEMPLARY - ie, so
obviously an example of these characteristics that everyone can feel
comfortable that a knight will "do the right thing" in all situations
both within and without the SCA.

What does all this have to do with fencing you ask?  I think that
fencing is a martial art, and that some of the social conventions
surrounding the Period which fencing comes from makes fencing not
suitable for knighthood - I.e., fencing is primarily a personal defense
weapon for city and country living and for defending your personal
honor.  It is not a weapon of war, and does not include the same
respect for your enemy and the intent to defend the population from
invasion, has no concept of fealty, and does not include a concept of
landed nobles justly ruling their territory etc, etc.  HOWEVER, I think
that fencing prowess could serve the same function that Heavy List
prowess performs - the person who is adept at fencing should be
examined as a potential candidate for OTC, and for Knighthood, just as
a rattan fighter is examined for those skills.

Now, I know that this is not East Kingdom policy at this point in
time, and I am not trying to start a big revolution for change,
this is just my opinion, so please bear with me...

In my mind, one of the roles in the SCA performed by knights is to
champion, protect and otherwise intervene in both fighting and
non-fighting causes.  In the SCA, the actual fighting ability of a
knight is not of immediate importance to his/her stature and courtesy
and chivalry and their ability to bring peace to some sort of personal
conflict.  Unlike the Middle Ages, serious (intensely personal) issues
are not settled by "trial by combat".  In the SCA, someone of stature
is approached by someone who needs help and is asked to intervene.  It
is those qualities which the knight brings to a situation which (in my
mind) consititute the chief ingredients which make the concept of
"champion" important.  A person who needs a champion should feel free
to approach any knight and ask for help in resolving a sticky situation
within the SCA.  The award of Queen's Order of Courtesy, like the
Queen's Champion, and various baronial and regional awards for Ladies
Champion mean the same thing in this context that knighthood means:
the deciding body nominates this person as exemplary of the qualities
which constitute the best features of the SCA and wise enough that
people should listen when this person speaks.

I think that a well-respected fencer who has the other aspects suitable
for knighthood should be considered for knighthood.  For non-fighters,
there is the Queen's Order of Courtesy, which (again only in my
opinion) can be used to recognize those people who are "knightly" by
manner, but who do not participate in the martial aspects of the SCA.

Ah well, enough philosophy - I have about ten times this amount to say,
but this will have to do for today.

Milord William,

Oops.  Here in the States journalists were kept busy for several days reporting
on the Stolkholm Massacre.  A week ago in Stolkholm, California, a man armed
with an AK-47 opened fire on a schoolyard full of children, killing five
wounding thirty, fifteen of the critically.  In the wake of this tragedy
the Legislature of California introduced a bill banning semi-automatic
weapons, and the police did a demonstration of the AK-47's destructive 
capacity in order to persuade everyone that semi-automatics were a Terrible Thing.
I pointed out that the demonstration showed about the same  capacity for
destruction as a bolt action rifle, or a heavy bow.

Because it was in the news so much I assumed eveyone would know what I was
talking about, thereby committing the sin I have railed against: Thinking my
perceptions were the same as everybody else's, so of course my way is right!

I will make one comment on this ridiculous debate as to whether we should

likewise, as this whole thing is getting rather boring.

We are the SCA, not the KKK.

We are not here to create a white anglo-saxon protestant or catholic group.

We are here to recreate the Middle Ages.  Not to create our own universe.

We cannot discriminate against non-European.  It is illegal to do so.

Would you have Master Kobayashi, obviously Japanese, required to be a Celt?

Or Coriadoc a Viking?

Thank you for your time, now let the subject drop.

Subject: non-European personae

 I have seen the debates, and have reached an opinion:  This discussion is
rather boring, and somewhat useless.
I approve on non-European personae within reason (i.e. Japanese, Chinese,
Mongol, etc...).

  Let's look at some facts.  The Celtic tribes that lived on coastal regions
had frequent trade with Phoenecian merchants, as did most of thte rest of the
world.  This in itself allows for Phoenecian and other Arab personae ( the
Phoenecians were known to hire help from other nations.)

  It was the Francs who stopped the Mongol invasion.  Concievably, there were
survivors of the battle (which was on European soil) who chose not to return
to their homelands.

The Cinese absorbed the Mongol invasion in their own country, and became part
of thte Mongol expansion as soldiers and survivors.  There is documentation of
a predominantly Chinese village in Germany shortly after the stop of the
invasion.

The Japanese had trade established with the Chinese, Phoenecians, and some few
European and African nations.  They sent emssaries to India and Mongolia, and
therefore could have been involved in various expansion campaigns.

The Vikings discovered America long before Clumbus, and were known for their
raids, in which they took slaves, so why couldn't they have captured some
native Americans?

The only objection I have in the case of non-European personae is the
existence of blode-haired, blue-eyed Samurai.  But if they must exist, so be
it.  Anybody interested in starting a Celtic Ninja Liberation movement?

Anybody wanting documentation of the facts I have briefly stated may contact
me on Pro-Angmar (WOLFEN), or may go to the local library.

Subject:  fencing chivalry

Gentlefolk,

        I write in answer to Benjamin di Rosa of Aldea's question about opening
the ranks of the Chivalry to fencers.  First let me say that I am a fencer
myself.  I am proud of my skills and I believe that if I keep working to
improve them they will be worthy of notice and respect.  However, knighthood is
not the venue for that respect.  There are two reasons that I feel this way.

        First, Rattan-style fighting recreates a period of fighting which
includes Knights as the very cream of fighters.  Knights in such a period
were (ideally) Chivalrous, Gentle, Wise, and Skilled In Many Arts.  However
they were first and foremost Fighters. (Remember these are 'Knights in Shining
Armor').  Now there were still knights in the period during which fencing
was the more normal fighting style.  However these knights were not made
knights becouse of their martial skills, but rather because of their service
to king and crown or Queen and Country or some such.  Therefore It is not the
order of Chivalry that is the highest award an Elizabethan generally would
aspire to, but rather the order of the Pelican that recreates what most such
Elizabethan Gentles would be given.

        The second reason is somewhat less intellectual and is far more
personal and therefore harder to explain or defend.  It runs something like
this:  I am a fencer.  I stand behind my Baron (His Excellency Patri du Chat
Gris, Baron Carolingia) in court and Before him in battle, and this is a
properly romantic and adventurous thing.  But I am not a "Knight in Shining
Armor".  Perhaps someday I will take up rattan.  Perhaps someday many years
after that I will be granted _THE Greatest Honor That The Society Gives_, but
not today, nor ever, for my skill with a rapier. (It's cliche, but I do get
bleary-eyed at the thought).

        However, certainly skill with a rapier should be rewarded as any other
skill is.  Laurel like any other art?  I don't know.  Maybe the OTC should be
opened to fencers (and archers for that matter).  Maybe the order of the
Guardsman might fill that place - I am still unsure about it as well.  (oops,
the OTC = Order of the Tyger Combattant - explained by a friend of mine
(Geoffrey Mathias) as 'an Eastern Stick-Jock award' - seconds before they
called him up into court to recieve it - much to his consternation).


        For partial answers and more questions, I remain,

I agree that the discussion on non-European personas is getting tiresome and

Sorry for the prolongation.

Milord HARALD LONGFELLOW:
I agree, particularly that it is a good idea to create a persona not just
for one self, but also for the group one is in. It is courteous to think of
others and not only of your own preferences. Well said, milord.

Milady AWILDA HALFDANE:
What is the Stockholm massacre? I didn't know there was one (unless you mean
the execution of 80 noblemen in 1520, commonly known as the Stockholm Blood-
bath).

Milord ARRON RENYARD:
*FLAME ON*
Milord, I not only disagree with your views, I also think your arguments are
bad. But to keep this posting short, I will just point to a few things.

I saw no need to define "Western European Culture" because I believe that
there is a general consensus on what this means.

You belittle the Dream when you depict it as a cover word for "elitism".

Labels like "purist" and "elitist" are a convenient way not to have to listen
to people, because everyone knows that purists and elitists are wrong by
definition. Even though I have jokingly called myself a purist, I am in fact
neither that nor an elitist, as should be obvious from the contents of my
previous postings. The words "pure" and "chaste" have, as far as I can remember,
not been used by anyone in arguing against non-Euros. I wouldn't dream of
asking that the SCA should be either of those things.

You reiterate questions which I have already answered clearly and repeatedly.
(e.g. "What harm does it do to let people assume personas that interest them?")
Read my postings again, and you will see that the answers are abundantly clear.

It is certainly not cultural bias to claim that Chinese and Europeans aren't
in the same context. How could it be "bias" or "discrimination" if a Society
chooses to study one part of the world and not another? That is nonsense, sir.

Re-creating the Middle Ages "as they should have been" does not mean creating
a fantasy with no relation to historic reality. It means creating an environ-
ment where people have a chance to experience the magic moment when the Dream
becomes *real*. We can never completely eliminate the 20th century, nor can we
create a system completely free from inconsistencies. The problem I have been
addressing is that for many of us, the Dream *is* the Age of Chivalry, which
does not become real in the presence of large numbers of non-European personas.
They aren't part of our Dream, and their presence makes it more difficult
to achieve the magic moments. The SCA would be unrealistic even without the
Oriental personas, what with the differences inside Europe AD 600-1600, but
most of us don't see that as a problem. I can experience "magic moments" in
the presence of Vikings and Tudors. But the orientals stick out and make it
much more difficult to forget that this is all a bunch of 20th century people
in costume.

I agree that elitism is a dead end. It is possible that diversity and change
can make the Society flourish. But if this is the future we want (or cannot
avoid), we should say so openly. We should then delete all the talk about
Western Culture and the Agy of Chivalry from the definitions and information
about the SCA, and replace them with the truth about what we are doing:
"Research and re-creation of a fantasy version of the cultural history of
the world between 600 and 1600".
*FLAME OFF*

Milord MICHAEL LICHFIELD:
True. You are telling us about reality. The non-Europeans are here to stay.
I regret this, but I am definitely not about to leave the SCA on account of
it. It's still a great group to be in!

Subject:  Diversity/non-European; New topics:  fencing; gate guards

Greetings!

The continuing discussions regarding the diversity/non-European personae issue
have been fascinating.  I should like to offer kudos to several individuals on
various aspects of their commentary:  to William de Corbie, for remembering
and noting that many of those of other-than-European persuasions have been
part of the Society for many years and served long and well (and where would
we be, had they not been here?); to Awilda Halfdane for her clarity, her well-
phrased arguments, and because I largely agree with her; and to Sophia Ficino
for an interesting and thought-provoking commentary (although I don't
completely agree).

I would like to re-iterate, quickly, several points of my own.  First,
everyone expressing an opinion on this issue has seemed *very, very* "pro" or
equally "con".  This has always been a touchy issue, and I don't think that
will ever change.  Second, regardless of what opinion any of us hold with
respect to this issue, diversity has been a part of the SCA for over 2 decades
now.  It's a little late to change; as I have always noted:  it's simple to
change a "no" to a "yes," but just *try* changing a "yes" to a "no!"  Lastly,
I think much of any gentle's comfort or discomfort with non-European personae
is perceptual (e.g., beauty being in the eye of the beholder, as it were).
Those perceptions are themselves based in no small measure on that
individual's motivation in joining, and view of, the Society.

My compliments, and my gratitude as a herald, for Arval's expansion upon the
duties of the Herald's Office.  I honestly beleive such was sorely needed.
Y'know, sometimes I think that trying to be a successful herald is somewhat
akin to trying to be a successful _and_honest_ politician...


I should like to bring up a new topic for discussion:  gate guards (or troll
booths) and their behavior.  I must note that this topic may be most
applicable to those Kingdoms where weekend-long events are the norm.

We're having a problem down here in Trimaris, and I'm wondering if the same is
happening elsewhere.  The problem is a lack of courtesy on the part of the
gate guards towards incoming gentles, who are thereafter (shall we say)
cranky.  There is a concurrent problem of lack of cooperation at times on the
part of those same incoming gentles, which isn't helping any.

To explain:  when people spend hours sitting out at the gate, sometimes in
foul weather and/or a state of weariness, it's hard for them to remember to be
courteous.  Yet, it's extremely important that they *do* remember.  And not
just for the obvious reasons, either.  During an all-weekend event, it can be
very necessary to be able to quickly determine which driver and/or passengers
are connected with which vehicles.  It is always necessary to keep track of
which vehicles have the right to be on-site.  This means that the gate guards
are often asked to register incoming vehicles (down here, at least).  Some
people resent being asked for this info to begin with.  When that resentment
is exacerbated by a gate guard's lack of courtesy...

So, mayhap those reading this perceive the problem.  Does anyone have any
viable suggestions for solving these problems.  Especially welcome would be
suggestions for educating the populace (articles in the Kingdom newsletter
taken as being a given).  Remember that there is a need to educate
_both_sides_ in this, without offending anyone or making anyone feel like
their being accused.


Speaking of new topics:  not a lot of fencing goes on down here in Trimaris,
but I watched the Academe of the Rapier with both fascination and admiration
at the TYC.  For myself, I can agree with the idea of an individual so
excelling at this martial art as to be worthy of being elevated to the
Chivalry.  Of course, this is providing that the gentle meets all other
requirements of the Peerage, including that of "peer-like behavior".


Regarding Chaluim Dearg's questions concerning the carrying of blades:  in a
purely mundane sense, laws regarding blades vary from state to state.
However, within the context of an SCA demo, the carrying of a blade is usually
sanctioned by those laws governing the theater.  In other words, a demo may be
viewed as a form of street theater, and blades are necessary props within that
context.  Thus, it's OK to carry them under such circumstances.  In Trimaris,
there is a continuing heavy emphasis placed on using scabbards and peace ties
**at all times**.  Leaving all steel behind when going off-site is also
encouraged.


Lastly:  will the gentleman in Ohio who so-kindly agreed to obtain some
information from OSU please contact me?  I've managed to lose your name and e-
mail address-- sorry!  (Grovel, Grovel, Grovel; Whimper, whimper...)

I thank one and all for taking the time to read these words.

Greetings!

Unlike many who've been posting their stories on the Rialto, a friend of mine
and I searched long and hard to find the SCA.

My friend (now Lord Knikolos Major) and I were told of the SCA by a friend on
the staff of the Programs Office at the University of Florida in Gainesville
(what we later discovered to be the then-Shire of An Crosaire).  Chad (our
friend) had just seen An Crosaire's first demo on campus.  After hearing
Chad's descriptions, Knikolos and I looked at each other and said "This is it;
we've **GOTTA** find these people!!"

Of course, we couldn't.  It drove us both absolutely nuts; we were *panting*
to join!

The following fall (nearly a year later), there was an SCA table at the annual
Student Organization Faire.  Knikolos charged up to the table and told those
sitting at the table (whom we would later come to know as Tetsuo and Kimineko
Sakura) how we had sought them, and signed us up.  The following Tuesday, I
attended my first shire meeting on both our behalfs.  That night, I knew I'd
found my niche.  Also that night, I met those gentles who would come to be my
family in many ways (remember, Seamus?).

That was just about 12 years ago.  My first event was Trimaris Memorial
Tourney III.  By TMT IV, I was autocratting my first feast and taking over the
office of Trimaris Herald.

TMT IV saw the second or third appearance of the OOO, which brings to mind 2
other silly orders:  the Order of the Cream Pitcher (long closed), for those
catty enough to receive it; and the Order of the Dust Bunny.  The ODB is for
those Consorts who, whilst being perceived as "decorative bits of fluff (but
put enough of 'em together and you get a dust bunny...)" in reality enable to
make the Reign go smoothly by not only taking care of the paperwork but by
also keeping the Soverign's butt out of the fire :-):-):-).  For this reason,
the ODB is synonomously known as the Order of the Dangerous Broads. :-)

For that matter, how many of us have heard of the Lay Sisters of Our Lady of
the Lamppost... :-):-):-)

                                  For the amusement of all,

Subject:  Those weird people

Concerning the situation of Non-europeans. I would like to point out that
Wm D C did not say that women should be treated like chattel, nor did he say
that precise authenticity was nescacary. However several gentles have implied
that he did. Personally I disagree with him, I feel that (for example) it is no
more jarring to see a Samurai walking with a 12 c. scot than it is to see a
16th century italian lady walking with a 6th c. celt. I do have some problems
with american indian, or other extreamly primitive societies (not implying any
insult to those societies, but I do find them rather jangling). Further I would
ask if those who do have a problem with that  could see themselves clear to
attempt to mould his dream so that they will include the non-euro's. I would
like to point to the fact that there are several people with non-euro persona's
already in, and most importantly, they are enjoying themselves as they are, is
it really so intrusive to add them to a world view which is already so broad.
One thing further, if you cannot accept them, then you have my apologies, for I
doubt you will ever be able to really live your "dreams" to any degree for
these persona's are already here and well established and the majority as far
as I can tell accepts them.

Subject: A new topic for debate

Good gentles of the Rialto, having grown tired of the non-European
persona debate, I wish to suggest a new topic for our forum to address.
(please remember that asbestos is a carcinogin and I'd rather not where it)
What is the sentiment of opening the orders of chivalry to fencers as well as
rattan fighters?  It seems to me that one form of honorable combat is as worthy
of the accolade of knighthood as the other.  I invite any and all reasonable 
comments on this subject.

I remain in service to thought provoking debate, low flaming, and good fun,

I had quite the opposite experience when I registered my name  and  device
at  the  last  Pennsic;  the  heralds at the tent were all willing to help
(although only one of them worked with me), and my device was checked  and
the  forms filled out in about fifteen minutes.  It still hasn't gotten to
the Laurel Queen of Arms yet 8*), but at least it's on its way...

Oh, which reminds me:  I know this subject has been beaten into the ground
already,  and  forgive  me  if someone has already suggested this (I can't
remember) but if there MUST be an all-inclusive name for the SCA which may
be used "in period", how about the "Laurel Kingdoms"?

Posted for Dame Enid Aurelia by Baron Henry.

Enid here, courtesy of Baron Henry.

Lady Malice: I did not see Lady Rebeccas entry about vegetables, but was
so interested in yours I find myself in the middle of a ten page article
on how to accomodate vegetarian, kosher and allergy restrictions and
still have a great feast...

(My qualifications are a passionate interest in food research, an MA in
classical archaology, a laurel in domestic crafts, personal allergies,
strict vegetarian friends, and a former roommate-my introduction to the
SCA-who knew how to , but did not keep, a kosher kitchen).

I don't want to inflict 10 pages on the net, but anyone who is interested
can let me know their postal address.

Try Gerard's Herbal and others for descriptions of medieval herbs and
vegetables. How to Cook Forsoothly (Raymond's Quiet Press available from
the Stock Clerk) is a good secondary source, so is Reay Tannahill, Food
in History.

Until the Rennaissance, it was more normal to cook greens than to serve
them raw. The prejudice against raw vegetables continues into Victorian
times.

I wouldn't eat what we call lupin in any form, it's poisonous. Use only
nasturium flowers because the seeds are poisonous.

Rue smells like soap, but is an ingredient in many of Apecius' recipes. A
small amount really brings out the flavour of other spices. (Try it in
fish and vegetable dishes.)

Wormwood in any quantity is poisonous, but a vegetarian friend says the
barest pinch of it makes great guacomole. Lots of medieval herbs are
somewhat noxious in great quantities: for example, tansy is an
aborifacient.

Vetch is a pea-like legume, not the blue flower. Broad beans were the
norm for most of the middle ages. You ate the seed not the pod. (Pole
beans and green beans as we know them are a late introduction).

For those interested in cooking in general, Lady Judith of Kirtland and
Lady Guillane de Vaux (wife of the current midrealm chronicler) are
organizing another cooking symposium for the spring. The date is not yet
fixed, but it is likely to be in Springfield, Illinois. We are also very
interested in starting a kingdom newsletter to exchange information about
sources, techniques and the like.

*****
I have a question about information on the net: is it Ok to publish news
from the net in a local newsletter, if it identified as coming from the
net, and being informal? For example, I might like to publish Mistress
Siobhan's explanation for late TI's, or Sir Alan's tentative information
on War. I don't want to tread on toes, so would someone please inform me
of the etiquette?

****
Lady Branwen: You might want to talk to Lord Kyrille Andreskevich (MK
Signet) about gold leaf. He doesn't live that far from you, I believe.

	"...We have essentially tribal peoples moving from loosely organized 
bands into larger groups with a quasi-divine warrior king..."

	This is an excellent description of what happened with the arabs 
during our period, but persia and bysantium had already highly developed 
centralized civalizations.  Has anyone researched the cultures that did keep a 
tribal/clan structure for well into the medieval period (i.e. the celts, any 
others?? my knowledge of the norse comes from a dimly remmembered 
'heimskrigle', and M. snorri was writing from the point of view of a 
nation-with-king.  also he was a story-teller, not an anthropologist).  In the 
writing of the romans the barbarians are all shown as tribal in nature, 
however, none of this seems to have survived into doccumentable period.  One 
may think of the roman empire as a tree that spread its roots over much of 
western europe which, when it died, left its structure imprinted in the soil 
of the countries it ruled...or think of an antfarm whose queen has died...by 
the time the invading germanic tribes, the franks and lobards, started handing 
down written material to us, they had pretty well aquired the language and 
social structure of the lands they had conquored...

Dougal McKinley writes:
	 "I am only trying to find out why the best of Oriental culture can 
not be a part of The Dream...."
  
Actually quite a lot of Oriental culture is already part of the "dream", just 
not overtly.  We owe a lot of our concepts of 'medieval' and 'chivalry' to the 
oriental martial arts  filtering in to us from california.  The "Belatrix 
snap" is an adaptation of oriental martial art to sca fighting.  A lot more of 
our concept of the age of chivalry to the victorians, who were also profoundly 
influenced by the influx of things newly coming to them from japan...

Tatiana writes:
	"Life for women in the Middle Ages sucked big time, unless they had 
lots of money ...extremely important family connections,or unusual 
circumstances.  Most of them were in some stage of child-birth or 
child-rearing for the majority of their adult life, often risking their lives
in the process.  Not my idea of a good time...."

Well, gee, life in the middle ages sucked big time for most people unless they 
had lots of money, extremely important family connections, etc.  That's why we 
tend to assume all personae are noble, so that we *have* lots of money.  As a 
noble woman with lots of money and important connections you can:  hand the 
babies over to a nurse as soon as they are born and never think of them again, 
send your lord on crusade and not have any babies until 9 months after he get 
back, have your husband die leaving you enough money to endow a small convent 
and set you in an important position in it, not get married at all but keep 
house for your father untill he dies after which you continue to run the 
household because almost everyone in it owes their loyalty to you and not your 
brothers wife who is busy having babies anyway,  or you can drink pennyroyal 
tea and not have babies no matter what your husband is doing.  Most women led 
horriblly restricted, no-fun lives, but there are sufficient examples of what 
women could do when they were rich and influential to act as guids for women 
who want to lead interesting lives.

further:"In sum, I refuse to play a game in which my activities are much more
restricted than they are in my every-day life."  

also, since we are not a living history museam, but out to have fun, we 
recreate several times a month events that would have happened at most a 
couple times a year (unless you were on the tourney circuit, or part of the 
king's household) You can always assume that the event you are attending falls 
in one of those months that you are not inconveniently pregnant.  And, if 
running a houshold with needlework, cooking, brewing, distilling herbs, 
spinning, weaving, and houshold accounts with occasional tourneys to see, 
dances, hunting (archery), indoor & outdoor games, music and songs to play or 
listen too, books to read or be read to from, stories to hear and tell, gossip 
and politics and flirting and poetry Arn't enough for you, you can always take 
on a male persona.  Or ignore the persona thing entierly.  All sca activities 
are open to all sca people, noone has to justify doing it in what ever garb 
they're wearing (so long as it's safe)

Re Kimonos:  Well they *are* comfortable.  Who wants to deal with tights and 
points and buttons and lacings at & a.m. in a cramped tent before one has had 
one's cofee? (what, no coffee? it's o.o.p.?? guess i'll just have to tramp up 
to the barn and get myself a diet coke...) QUESTION:  What is period european 
undress?  I know what the middle agers wore in bed, but what did they wear for 
lounging around on saturday mornings, or raiding the fridge at midnight?  If i 
knew that, maybe i wouldn't have to wear my flannle nightie on my last trip to 
the bathhouse before turning in, and the gentlemen in my camp would'nt want to 
slouch about in their kimonos while waiting for the frumenty to boil on the 
koleman stove...

To the lady who wanted a persona as a "professional":
	Baroness Morgiane de Provance had (has?) and alternate persona, "La 
Genereuse" who wore her hair uncovered (!!!) and informal dress and sang 
(she's very good) some *interesting* songs...
	May i ask what century/country you are considering?  you may be able 
to find laws deeling with it--sometimes they were illegal and more or less 
invisible, on the otherhand in the court of byzantium you could'nt tell the 
difference (oo! bad malice, bad! (whack) mrowww!)
	also get a hold of a good footnoted book f the poems of Francois 
Villon and look up 'la belle haumierre lamenting the time of her youth' and 
"advice to the 'filles de joi'"(daughters of joy, or simply joy-girls).  Some 
of his other poems cast light on the life of lower class people of his time
	Mary the Egyptian is probably the saint for you--look her up in any 
good book of saints.

Subject: Re:  SCA Digest #228

One more story from joining SCA in Nordmark (Sweden).

As opposed from Lindorm, lord William and Harabanar, who were in from the start
I joined only one and a half years ago. I have known of the Swedish group since
it started, since I knew some of the people who started it. I even got the 
newsletter the first half year or so. But I was put off by the emphasis on 
fighting and adventures; I rather wanted to learn about the middle ages and
reenact it as faithfully as possible (except the plague and all other
nastiness, of course). (This was during a time in my life when I considered
myself a grownup. I have become a whole lot younger since then.)
Two and a half year ago, several of my friends went to the Visby event, and told
me all these wonderful stories about it. I was sick with envy, and realised that
I wanted very much to have been there. So the next year I disregarded the grunts
from my boyfriend and went. I sew myself a simple costume in two days, which I
have used ever since (with small modifications). The event was great. I 
discovered pretty soon that I even could enjoy watching the fighting, court was
a funny show, and the banquet was great. Even more did I enjoy a more informal
gathering the evening before the banquet, where we sat outside and ate lamb
cooked over an open fire. And I loved the people I met ! I guess I was hooked
already, but my reason told me I needed a second try.

The next Nordmark event was a coronet tourney for Drachenwald, in Nykoping.
This was in october, so I sew a new costume in two days, suitable for the
weather (it turned out to be colder than I thought, though). This event made
an everlasting impression on me. This was the time I started to understand what
SCA really was, the vast amount of tradition it has aquired during its years.
What awed me most was a knighting, the third one ever in Drachenwald. 
Suddenly, court wasn't just a funny show any more, I realised that what was
happening really MEANT something to the man kneeling up there.

After Nykoping, I was in up to my ears. I have engaged my self a lot in our
not-yet-official canton, mostly with music and dancing, and some formal stuff,
being dept. senechal. (I also broke up with my non-SCA boyfriend which made it
a whole lot easier to engage myself... well I DID have other reasons too...)
I enjoy every part of the SCA: the fighting (as a spectator), the "adventure"
events (which resembles DoD in full-size more than some kind of middle ages) 
and of course the costumes. After the last Visby event it felt completely wrong
putting on a normal skirt, after being in full-length gown for five days. It
felt like life suddenly became very plain, and akwardly normal.

I hope I will always remain dreaming...

Milady Awilda Halfdane,

You are not being exceptionally paranoid, I fear - but to avoid an
inappropriate flamesfest let me add that this is my own opinion.

Still, a question has been sparked - what ARE the laws (typically)
regarding the carrying of blades? Could I be troubled by a peeler
for lugging a claidheam-mhor about in public?

And another: have you a reference handy whereby one could learn 
about this Chinese repeating crossbow??

And yet another: Does anybody know of a source for long-bows?

Glenn Thain writes (but my answeres apply to the writings of a lot of people):

     "Nobody has stated that they want to open up the boundries on timeframes"

The arguments in favor of cavaliers are statements that the timeframes should 
be broadened to include at *least* 1649.  we're not paranoid, they really are 
out to get us.

and in responce to W. de Corbie's:
 "[the Age of Chivalry] it involves the ideals of medieval Europe,centering on 
the High Middle Ages (AD 1000-1500) - but allowing for some things which ...
still belong in the same cultural and traditional environment. "

   "Uh, same cultural and traditional environment? Over a 500 year timespan?"

well, actually, yes.  One church (the catholic).  One international language 
(latin).  a relatively restricted set of literature that was recopied, 
re-read, and replagerized by generation after generation.  A lifestyle bounded 
by the necesseties of agriculture.  from the mid 14th through 15th c. a 
remarcably uniform cuisine (befor that, we have no sourses.  after that it 
changed) etc.

flames!
listen, guys,  will y'all stop putting out arguments of the form "a is not 
equal to b, therefore c must be ok because it doesn't equal either of them" 
and start coming up with good solid reasons why b is close enough to a to be 
allowed, while c is not (or c is closer than we thaught)?  (e.g. i've done 
enough cooking to know that the engish, french, and italian were all fairly 
similar, but the arabs are wierd (sorry mustapha, but it's true)

	"O.K., which of the many varied ideals of Chivalry within this

	Victorian.  Read "ivanhoe"  read "the white company"  read howard 
pyle. read the old "prince valliant" comics.  

    "Just where do you want to draw this line?"

the official guidelines are europe, about 600 to 1600.  This does *not* mean 
that we're targeting everything between those two points for study and 
re-creation, it means that we're pretty sure that what we're aiming for does 
not lie *outside* them.  There are very few points in history where one can 
say, after this point *everything* changed (i can think of only one and it 
hasn't happened yet.  wont, i hope)...there are always a few for-runners to 
every event, there are always a few enlcaves it doesnt reach, a few customs 
that linger on.  The middle ages is a fuzzy concept.  use the guidelines to 
focus on what the middle ages *were*, and, when you're comfortabley sure, 
start bending them.  It's like following a reciepe.  it's allways a good idea 
to follow it exactly the first time, and play with it after you see what you 
get.  if you start saying "if 1/8 tsp. salt, why not 1/4?, if 1/4, why not a 
half?"  by the time you get up to 2 tablespoons by that reasoning, you might 
see no reason not to put in a whole cup (and by that time there might not be 
any)

Flame warning!!
"the middle-ages as they should have been" is a cute-ism for explaining us in 
one line to newcomers and non-us.  it is amusing (ha ha). it is not a rigorous 
definition of what we do, it is not a guideling for research, it is not a 
valid excuse for saying "well, if the [insert culture here] had an [insert 
out-of-period object here] they would have used it" and then making garb out 
of shocking pink polyester ( the middle agers would have *loved* shocking pink 
polyester) excise this phrase from your vocabulary.
flame off

    " Why not? If this is a fantasy about how *we*, (the operative word here),
wanted to see the Middle Ages,..."

AHA! milord, you have hit the knail on the knoggin (as my father says).  "we" 
indeed!   One may think of this as a game with very few rules and not the ones 
you think they are, either.  I have *my* (malice's) idea of how things should 
work, you (2nd person singular) have (obviously) yours.  I can try to get as 
many people as possible to see things my way, here by the force of my rhetoric 
and logic, localy by my example.  you will do the same.  If enough people see 
my way that i continue to have a good time, i win.  If enough people see 
things sufficiently differently that i can no longer have a good time, i lose. 
 If sufficient people see things sufficiently differently that noone has a 
good time, everyone loses.  I want everyone to see things my way becuase i 
think it is a good way, and i think if someone saw it my way, they would think 
it was good too.  I cannot exclude anyone from my vision, i cannot force any 
one to it.  i can offer, i can (try to ) persuade, i can be an example.



on an entirely different subject:

Awilda Halfdane writes 
..."groups with a quasi-divine warrior king..."

can i have some examples of what y'all think a "quasi-divine warrior king" is? 
 I'm not being facitious, i'ts a concept worth exploring.  there was a 
definite divine component to kingship right up to charls 1 of england whose 
head was cut off and maybe after, but its negligible compared to the fully 
divine kings, like the inca.  Also it was clear that the kings function was 
largely legislative judicial and tax-collecting, but all the *popular* kings 
were the ones who went to war (e.g. richard 1).  needs more thought

It is rather bawdy and (IMHO) best done when sung by several dignified ladies

Good night all,
if this mailer is finally working (hope) this should reach you, I apologize for
any bizzare garbage that may have spewn forth from one of my accts here.

I am honestly trying once again to develop a really good persona (well at least
a well organized plausable one) and would like to get some suggestions on
places to look for detailed information on garb etc. I am considering a
Scottish gentleman cir. 1540 AD who has taken to the sea, specifically he has
been on a voyage to the orient (japan mainly). I have the following questions

1. Is it plausale that a Scot could have gotten on an english or spanish ship
going to Japan?

2. If so,, how long would such a voyage have lasted?

3. What sort of clothing would he have worn? Both in court and more active
situations, from what I have read a linen shirt, tights, poupoint(sp?) and a
cloak of some sort seem to have been the order.

Any general information of that period or type of activety would be appreciated
as would any suggested reference.

Master Bruce Draconarius, Crescent Herald for Caid, highly recommended the
*Oxford Guide to Heraldry* on a current missive.  Since I don't have the
letter in front of me, I can't tell you what he said, but apparently, he
recommends the book highly to any and all heralds.  

Since Fridrikr is a member of the Heraldry Society of England, we receive
all sorts of interesting information including, just recently, an order
form for the above book.

So, I thought that I would let anyone out there who is interested in the
book know how to get one.

The ad introduces the book as "The most authoritative and up-to-date
introduction to heraldry available".  "This guide to the history and uses
of heraldic symbols is the only one available to have been wholly written
by Officers of Arms"  (authors are Thomas Woodcock, Somerset Herald and
John Martin Robinson, Fitzalan Pursuivant Extraordinary).  "Subjects
covered include:  origins of heraldry; composition of arms and their
appearance; how and why arms are granted, and to whom; the evolution of
arms as families grow and intermarry; and the use of arms as decoration.
Most attention is paid to Britian, but there are separate chapters on
American and Continental heraldry."  The book includes an illustrated
glossary and illustrations from the College of Arms library, which contains
"...the most important collection of heraldic manuscripts in the world,
many of which are unavailable to the public."

To order the book, write to:
The Heraldry Society
44/45 Museum Street
London  WC1A 1LY

Cost (in POUNDS) is 17.50 with 2.00 to cover postage and handling.  Make
cheque or money order payable to The Heraldry Society.

It is truely fascinating to receive information, articles, etc. from a
modern  College of Arms.  Of course, some of the heraldry is too complex
and modern for us, but some of the historical information on arms is
interesting and informative.  The Royal College is still designing and
registering arms for people, places, and things.

Subject: Can we agree to disagree?

Digging back through my archives, I find that this argument about non-
European personae was in full swing by digest 198, a solid month ago. In
that time, I would say that every argument has been repeated at least
three times, and there is no evidence that anyone has been swayed in their
stance one bit. The discussion is generating a good deal more heat than
most topics here, and is smoldering down to the point where it is shedding
precious little light. Therefore, I ask that people puh-leeze knock it off;
if you're not going to listen to each other, there isn't much basis for
argument, and this issue's been generating a lot of volume since it started.

Both sides have made good and valid points, most of which have been
argued about for many years and not resolved. To the people who are fighting
for their right to "alternative" (ie, non-(600 to 1600 Western European))
personae, I suggest: fine, but remember the sensibilities of others, and
don't go out of your way to be weird (I know, most people don't, but the
few who do can be most jarring). To the people who are forseeing the death
of the SCA through dilution: relax. It's easy to predict the death of an
organization (lord knows the immanent death of Usenet is predicted every
six months without fail), but it just isn't *likely*. And bear in mind
that, for the most part, the people with alternative personae have done
a lot more research into those personae than your basic Generic SCAdian.

A suggestion: Steffan, howzabout you devote an issue of the Philosopher's
Newsletter to this issue? It's clear that there's a lot of interest in it,
and it would give these good people an opportunity to set forth their views
in a forum designed for just that purpose...

I do so request--sounds like good reading.  

On the topic at hand, I think you have isolated the first problem as
being one of terminology--once we've figured out what we're talking
about, then we can disagree with each other's opinion.  I think that
"Medieval Japan" and "Japan's Medieval period" are obviously two
completely different concepts -- but clearly not everyone venturing an
opinion on the subject feels this is obvious. 

Contrariwise, the wording in the various sets of official rules for
choosing a persona are quite clear -- European, 600 - 1600, a set
limit for how many languages to use in one's name, no ambiguity here!
Perhaps its been too long since the last time these rules were
published--as opposed to being available at the local council office,
behind three locked doors, in a locked file cabinet, in plain view. 

Personally, I am greatly interested in Japanese culture, and have been
trying unsuccesfully to convince myself that I can claim to be a 16th
c. spaniard/portugee who went to the japans on a trade/missionary
venture, and so forth, and more or less come to the conclusion that
Occam's razor dictates that any such story collapse under the sheer
weight of research necessary to support it.  So instead I have an
"alternate persona", and try to save it for occasions where it will
not be too jarring to others (i.e. "An evening with the Medici" was
right out)

On the other hand, I find that Master Kobayashi blends right in --
being Japanese, he has a natural advantage over me.  In period, a few
visitors from foreign climes, looking strange, were typical -- more
likely moors than japanese, but I think it is the mix-- mostly of one
culture, with a few visitors from another--that is the important part.
A room filled 50/50 with <random racial mix, predominantly white>
Europeans and  <random racial mix, predominantly white> Europeans in
Jap garb just doesn't seem right.  Again, if there are a bunch of folk
in Japanese garb at an event, they should cluster up -- so they appear
as a delegation of visitors -- rather than mingling freely with
everyone. 

Most of our run-of-the-mill events are not so formal that this sort
ofthing makes a big difference. I had in mind, in making these
comments, big events, where a serious attempt to construct a persona
not just for yourself, but for the group you are with, will be noticed.

     Easily. You're promoting a "purist" attitude I find unacceptable,
elitist, and promotes unnecessary hurt feelings. Using your own argument
against you, with 1,000 years of "Western European Culture ", (defined as....
...?), to be the base, your Persona from the 14th Century would undoubtably 
feel just as out of sorts with a Viking warrior cira 1000 as he would with an 
Oriental Samauri or Persian Shah. What you're complaining about, using the 
purity of the Society argument, is that *your* perceptional asthetics would
be hurt. This in no way jepordizes the fabric of the Society. Somehow I just 
don't fathom the idea that 1,000 years of vauge and shifting patterns in the
societal fabric is any more stable just because we've tentativly agreed on
a geographical region, (which, you must admit is even more varied than the
japanese/chinese of the same periods). Somehow, when I interpert what you're
saying it doesn't smack so much of trying to retain guidelines as it smacks
of elitism. Elitism raised under the burgeois banner of the "Dream".

     This is a straw man argument. Nobody has stated that they want to open up
the boundries on timeframes, (say 400 - 1700), only that they want to explore
the other civilized cultures of the stated time period. The SCA is already 
diversified, what harm does it do to let people assume persona's that interest
them? Or is it too far fetched that part of the Dream may encompass the 
intermingling of cultures that really didn't intermingle. That part of this
depiction of the Middle Ages as they should have been would be to promote
a wider basis of cultural exchange.

     Uh, same cultural and traditional environment? Over a 500 year timespan?
Yea, right. Let's examine this for what it is, eh? So long as we're not trying
to be a historical society, (which we're not), what bleeding difference does
it make to mix arab/europe/china/japan/add nasueum in the same room. Answer? 
There is a strain of thought that the Society should remain pure to the ideals
of Chivalry. O.K., which of the many varied ideals of Chivalry within this
timespan should be adhered to? French? German? English? Arthurian?

     The Society is a composite and as such needs to retain the flexiblity 
to allow people to pursue their interest in the Middle Ages regardless of
cultural bias already established. That's what we're really talking about
here, cultural discrimination, not whether the Society should remain "pure"
and "chaste" in it's approaches.

     Who are "they"? The French? The Germans? The English? Arthurians?

     Just where do you want to draw this line?

     And......if we are narrowing it down that far then all the Vikings and
Celts better look for a new home, I don't remember the Dane raiders as being
particularly chivlaric. Nor the Celts. 

     In other words, you're creating the very SCA you claim to despise.

     With 1500+ members in the Society per kingdom, how could you help avoid
change? Besides, I thought you wanted to recreate the Middle Ages the way it
*should* have been, not the way it was.

     Why not? If this is a fantasy about how *we*, (the operative word here),
wanted to see the Middle Ages, why not? Because some faction of prigs has
decided that 1,000 years of geographical diversity is enough? Because they
have decided that the people should adhere to guidelines poorly thought out,
accept arguments based on straw men issues and half conceived rationalizations
for support? I think not.

     The Society is changing, as an extension of the new people who join who
aren't locked into this inflexible "Dream". So long as everyone has a good
time and the regulations don't endanger anyone, what difference does it make?
The Dream ruined? No, the only thing that will come from the acceptance of
these different cultures are new friends and new good times and memories.
Elitism is a dead end. Only through change and growth will the Society 
continue to flourish and nurture.

Message-ID: <890126001551.11.CONS.ELF@AIDA.CSD.UU.SE>

Milady Awilda Halfdane:

We may have different opinions of what the SCA should be. Living in America,
you probably have a wider experience of the totality than I do. But when I
joined, I was led to believe that it *was* an Age of Chivalry group. In fact,
I have never seen any written information that even hinted at anything else.
Meeting the SCA in America last year, I was astonished at all the Orientals,
Barbarians and other non-European personas.

I agree that one reason why the SCA has become so big is probably that it
encompasses so much, but I don't believe that this will make it endure.
People are founding subgroups, *not* because the SCA is to narrow for them,
but because it is *too broad*. The subgroups are places where people try
to create their Dream in a way they can't do in such an all-encompassing 
group as the SCA. Reason: many of us find it difficult to enjoy our Dream
in the presence of totally out-of-place personas.

I can understand that you think non-European personas are necessary - after
all, you live in the American melting-pot culture, where you have people
of every possible origin around you all the time. Western Europe isn't
*your* origin - the place for you to seek your roots - but you know and
like a lot of SCA people and you want to be in the group with them. At the
same time, you don't want to do European things. Well, I can see that you
would have a problem in the William de Corbie (Strict & Rabid Purist Narrow-
Minded European High Medieval) version of the SCA...

The question is not wether or not we want to fight the Western bias for
Western things, e.g. in order to broaden people's minds. The question is
wether it is necessary to do non-European things in this group. I cannot 
see anything intrinsically wrong or narrow-minded about having a group
that is devoted to a single and well-defined theme. I would definitely
prefer the Society for Medieval Japanese Culture to the Society for Dressing
Up And Having Fun.

Perhaps theme events and households can remedy part of the problem. But isn't
that just another way of creating subgroups and having events where out-of-
place personas cannot attend? This is what I believe will happen in the
future. The SCA will remain a large group and a hotchpotch of cultures,
but more and more of its members will devote more and more of their time to
subgroups where they can enjoy their Dream with those who share it.

Milord Dougal McKinley:

Let me confess that I am also into Bushido. I do Aikido and Iaido, and my
house is full of Japanese swords, jo-sticks and stuff. I would love to dress
up and play Samurai in a historic re-creation group. It's just that I want that
to be a different group from the one where I'm a medieval lord. Have you read
"Shogun" by James Clavell? It should tell you something of how alien the
Western world was to the Japanese, and vice versa. I just cannot see how
we can play both things at the same event. This just makes the event less
credible as a re-creation of *any* historic era. And I always feel like
laughing when a "Samurai" persona walks into an SCA event and behaves exactly
like all the Western lords there - and not at all like a Samurai. It would
be just as ridiculous to see a glitz of Tudor ladies kowtow. As a European
lord I can act out my persona in the SCA, as a Samurai I could not.

What you are saying (if I am getting you right) is that the SCA is neither
European or Oriental, but a culture in its own right. This is exactly what
I *don't* want it to be or become! I want it to be a group that studies and 
re-creates the ideals and good realities of the European Middle Ages, not a
group that creates a peculiar hotchpotch culture of mixed people in fancy
dress, based on everything and re-creating nothing.

I believe also that the SCA was created to depict the Western Age of Chivalry,
and that the oriental things have gotten in because there were lots of Bushido
people around who didn't have anywhere to play. At least, that is part of the
background. But historic re-creation is more than a number of fiercely inde-
pendent individuals who make costumes and develop personas. It is a recreation
of a culture, a society, a traditional environment. It is only when all the
pieces in that re-creation work together that the Dream becomes real.

I guess this discussion could go on forever, but perhaps we should avoid
clogging the net with a too-long iteration of the arguments. Since it seems
that the overwhelming majority of those who write on the net are in favour of
non-European personas, I guess there is nothing left for me to do but to
bow to reality and shut my big mouth.

Yours on a soap box,

u
In the wake of the Stockholm massacre legislation has been introduced to ban
semi-automatic weapons in California.  Police gave a demonstration of the AK-47
that was very misleading.  They shot a watermelon and a wooden board at a slow
rate of speed.  My lord remarked that the same damage and rate of fire could be
achieved with a bolt action rifle.  I replied that the same damage and rate of
speed could be achieved with a longbow or a crossbow.  This reminded me that it
is currently illegal to sell or manufacture any handgun in the state of
Maryland without a permit.  To get  a permit you have to petition a board.
The board is politically appointed by the governor (who doesn't like guns), and
is drawn from five anti-gun groups, two pro-gun groups, and two neutral groups.
You tell me how many permits are going to be issued.

Everywhere you go there are laws about concealed weapons, martial arts
weapons, blades of certain length and whatnot.  In other words, a good deal of
the cutlery running around SCA violates the law.  I know personally a man who was
arrested after a SCA event for carrying a concealed weapon because he had a
boken thrust through his belt.  Has anyone else had any encounters with the
law?  I am also worried that once the police figure out we've got competent
fighters they'll require us to register our knights, just like martial artists
with black belts have to register.  

Another thing, in Maryland it is illegal to hunt with a crossbow.  Is this true
of other states?  It is possible for a handicapped pwerson to get a permit to
hunt with crossbow if he is unable to use a regular bow.  Being handicapped
I've thougt about applying for one just to see how they handle it, but I don't
really want to attract attention to myself.  I don't think they'd respond very
well to a Chinese repeating crossbow. (I don't have it yet, but I'm
negotiating for its building).


Does this bother anybody else?  Or am I just paranoid?

It simply means that I didn't really understand them.

I didn't think that I had any strong feelings on the subject of non-

that I take no issue with any one else's opinions.  Everyone has the

She continues with comments on the massive emphasis in the SCA on white
north European culture, and history of ties between Europe and Africa
in trading and exploration.

Mecca is not in Europe.  Europeans visited Mecca on the Crusades, and brought
back many strange and wondrous objects and customs, but they were considered
STRANGE, not normal.

As I understand those limits, they are the period of 600-1600 in the 
continent of Europe.  African and Asian influences are studied because of
their affect on Europe, but they themselves are not the emphasis of research.

I'm afraid I cannot agree with this opinion.  No history or definition of
"medieval" that I have read has ever had omitted reference to Europe, 
particularly Northern Europe.  Numerous comparisons have been made to 
phases of development in other cultures, but those are not included in the
definition of "medieval".
 
>The other limits are informal limits of personal prejudice.  The problem

The SCA is not an arena for eradicating racial prejudice from the world
by requiring that all races extant in the world in the years 600-1600 be
researched and represented at events and in the membership.  The SCA is a 
society freely open to anyone interested in studying the dress, habits, 
customs, fighting styles, food, arts, sciences, etc., of persons living 
in "medieval" times, as defined by the chronological limits of 600-1600 
A.D., and the geographic limits commonly understood by historians in 
referring to the "medieval world".

Racial, sexual, financial and other prejudices must be fought, and fought
constantly.  One would hope that the lessons of chivalry practiced in the
SCA would encourage people to demonstrate by example appropriate behavior
towards those different from the local norm.  This part of the posting is
getting quite long - I will stop with this (short?) discourse, and 
encourage those interested in continuing discussion to mail me their
comments.

To William de Corbie:

Sir, 

I agree most heartily with much of your posting on this matter.  

You state the "Dream" of the Society as recreating or living in
>the ideals of medieval Europe, centering on the High Middle Ages 
>(AD 1000-1500) - but allowing for some things which strictly speaking belong 
>outside that time, because they still belong in the same cultural and 
>traditional environment. 

That has in fact always been my understanding of the expressed goal
of the Society.  Your comments on the infrequency of contact with oriental
and other cultures in the era, and the inappropriateness of such personas
at SCA events are well taken.  

I must, however, disagree with the tone of your closing statements (in
an earlier posting).  I'm afraid that the theme of the Society may in
fact be changing.  I do not feel that I can tell other people how to play
the game.  If I don't like what they're doing, I'm the one who has to
"pick up my ball and go home".

It is encouraging to read attitudes similar to mine.  I'm not sure how
common they are.

My feelings are very similar.  I was not interested in a group that got 
together to bang each other about the head and shoulders, or play at
being kings and queens.  I started in the SCA with some friends - and I
stayed in it just because that's what they wanted to do.  (Hi, Adelicia!)

I continued in the SCA, even though I'd planned on leaving, when I moved
to Virginia (is anyone still there in Blacksburg?) precisely because I
had finally found people who were really interested in historical research,
and in accuracy of implementation.  People were researching in some very
different directions, but all the knowledge collected was considered
valuable and interesting, by at least some one else around.

I have become VERY frustrated with the fluctuating quality of various
organizations in the SCA.  I am fed up with petty politics and maneuvering
for position and advantage.  I don't want to have to suffer the prejudice
(cf. previous comments) of those folks who don't think life in England
in 1100 A.D. is as significant as research into the Italian Renaissance.

All I want to do is try to understand through any means I can what it was
like to live in an earlier period of history - specifically, the middle ages.
I'm trying to understand MY roots by reading about them and living in them.
The SCA looked like a great opportunity for me to actually do that, but its
brightness is a little tarnished on closer inspection, and is becoming more
so as I have been exposed to more of it.

Subject:  Those weird ppl

Concerning the situation of Non-europeans. I would like to point out that
Wm D C did not say that women should be treated like chattel, nor did he say
that precise authenticity was nescacary. However several gentles have implied
that he did. Personally I disagree with him, I feel that (for example) it is no
more jarring to see a Samurai walking with a 12 c. scot than it is to see a
16th century italian lady walking with a 6th c. celt. I do have some problems
with american indian, or other extreamly primitive societies (not implying any
insult to those societies, but I do find them rather jangling). Further I would
ask if those who do have a problem with that  could see themselves clear to
attempt to mould his dream so that they will include the non-euro's. I would
like to point to the fact that there are several people with non-euro persona's
already in, and most importantly, they are enjoying themselves as they are, is
it really so intrusive to add them to a world view which is already so broad.
One thing further, if you cannot accept them, then you have my apologies, for I
doubt you will ever be able to really live your "dreams" to any degree for
these persona's are already here and well established and the majority as far
as I can tell accepts them.

Subject:  Courtesey

In reading of the viscious and not so viscious flaming going about concerning
non-europeans it reminds of the battles over authenticity vs. fun. It has
always been my opinion thaty one should have as much fun as possible by
whatever mean as long as it does not intrude upon anyone elses fun. In all I
refer to courtesey, which also includes not jumping on a newbies first tunic
that she worked 5 hrs on just because her sleaves were not right on it. But
what do you do if your very persona intrudes on someones dream? You are
obviously enjoying yourself and you have probably put a lot of work into it yet
someone comes up and says " no, thats not right".
   By the very fact that there are already well established people with
non-euro persona's, they are an important part of the SCA. If the Copora and
bylaws do not seem  to accept this then they need to be changed. The important
word here is SOCIETY, a group of people, we are what makes up the SCA and if
we accept non-euro's then they have to be included. And it has been my
experience that they are accepted.

There is at least one person with a harlot persona in the SCA (and she used to
be my Lady: interesting problems being a chivalrous baron in that situation!).
I wouldn't recommend this persona for the shy or weak-willed, obviously.

Subject: Tiger in oriental culture

The story is that just before the first Pennsic War, the East decided it
needed a totem to balance the Middle's dragon. The Middle had chosen a dragon
as a pun on "the Middle Kingdom" (i.e. China). Master Alfgar the Sententious,
then Brigantia Herald, determined that in Korea, a blue tiger was the Guardian
of the East, and he just translated it into a more heraldic, European form
(the tygre). BTW, the heraldic tygre is *NOT* a striped kitty; it more
resembles a scruffy wolf with a hooked nose. I cringe at those puddy-tats on
the T-shirts sold at Pennsic every year....

        Among other things, East Kingdom Historian
P.S. The tygre's main characteristic is supposed to be pride. When my
household was designing the EK war standard (now lost) we chose the motto
"justified pride" in Latin, but it came out "Proud [and] Just" and was never
corrected.

Subject: January Postings

In reply to various recent stuff:
ERIC: I remember reading somewhere that "eric" has a meaning of "flat ground"
or somesuch. The OED, however, only gives "monetary penalty for violent
crime". Anyone have documentation as a legit term?
FAIR WITNESS: I often quote a story about a clergyman, mathematician, and
logician in a train in Scotland. They see a black sheep on a hillside. The
clergyman (secure in faith) says "All sheep in Scotland are black". The
statistician (extrapolating) says "Some sheep in Scotland are black". The
logician says "At least one sheep in Scotland is black on at least one side".
AUTOCRATING DISASTERS (Can you top this?) I autocratted an event at a Site We
Have Used Before. Naturally, I didn't need to see it again. (Well, I was new
and naive....). I explained to the secretary of the Guy In Charge exactly what
we wanted to do (we're cooking this feast, see). Being paranoid, I called to
confirm. Weekly. For two months. No problem. Four days before, I say, "that's
X dollars, including use of the kitchen, right?" She says, "plus Y dollars for
the policeman". I say, "You said he wasn't necessary if it's a dry event". She
says "New city ordinance". I say "Since when?". "Last month". "Why didn't you
say so?" "Not my problem." My co-autocrat calls her old friend the Mayor. Two
days before: I call again to confirm. "...Including the kitchen." Oh, there's
no kitchen". We go to the site and pound on doors. Someone lets us in. There's
a kitchen. Day of event, we're cooking. Mystery Guy in Charge shows up. Who
told you you could use the kitchen? Your secretary. "No kitchen; everyboddy
out". Two large Viking-types enter, dressed in strange clothes with
meat-cleavers in hand. "OK, you can use the kitchen, just clean up OK."
BREWING COMPETITIONS: My esquire, the Guildmaster of EK Brewers held a class
at 12th nite on judging. Very good idea. I will post address next time.
GAMES BANNED IN FAVOR OF ARCHERY: I thought it was *golf*.
BOROUGHS: The CoA determined some years ago that Carolingia's boroughs were
actually guild-equivalents. They are not official branches, but they are more
official than households in that they have a bureaucratic connection with the
baronial government. Note that "Colleges" under Corpora do not get dissolved
if they go below minimum requirements: they just go abeyant. That's the
advantage over cantons.
CATALAN VENGEANCE ("Six Gold Rings"). Was written by Lord Moses ben-Eldad (of
the Bridge). Master Yosef (Boss MoAS: look in TI) can contact, no doubt. This
song is the reason for the annulets on Duke Vissevald's arms, by the way....
HOW I JOINED: I heard of these weirdos in Calif very early but took no action.
Saw live chess on Cambridge Common in earliest days of Carolingia. Went to RI
to visit friends in 1976. Tall Ships had left, they suggested "this
middle-ages fair thing might be fun". Turned out to be Camelot, a legendary
two-week RenFair at which SCA participated. Got names (all SCA), lost list.
Year later, Dad sees question in "Ask the Globe" (local newspaper) on "How do
I find SCA", remembers I'm interested. I write Vicar of Carolingia, she gives
no. of canton Seneschal. I knew I was in when I decide to drive from Boston to
Philadelphia for the day...and back that nite without crashing.

In my reading of this, I see that my persona can NOT be non-European.  But,
my European Fighter can be come "fascinated by oriental products" and adopt
the Katana and Kata of the Samari.  This meets your requirements for 
participating in The Dream.

I have long been interested in Bushido and things oriental.  My first introduction
to SCA was a friend pointing out the "SCA-bums" beating on each other with
large sticks while we were on our way to Kendo to beat on each other with
small sticks :-).  I stopped and asked questions and was told repeatedly
that my Kendo methods would not work in the dream world of the SCA and that I
should not consider joining the SCA as an oriental persona.  So I did not
join at all.  The limits placed on fighting style were to strict to make
it worth my while.

Three years later I was dragged to a twelfth night by my Lady to be.  The people
that I talked to were all kind, understanding and "chivalrous".  They were the
reason that I decided that joining the SCA might be worth while.  There followed
Pensic War!  What a sight, 5000 plus people all living The Dream!  And lo!  Some
were living the law of Bushido!  I was sold!  

What I am trying to say is that The Dream is NOT European culture, it is not
Oriental culture, The Dream to me is that world of wonder created by kind,
understanding and chivalrous people dealing with "the world as it should have
been" when meeting others.  What harm does it do to your Dream when my
persona marches to battle, performs a sword dance,  and the begins battle
with Katana at Komi and ends the battle with (hopefully) a highland fling?
Would not any good fighter choose to use a well made katana in a method
of sword fighting that was old when Europeans were just discovering steel?

Please do not take this as a personal attack.  I am only trying to find out
why the best of Oriental culture can not be a part of The Dream.  How does
the laws of Bushido contest with the European culture that is a part of
The Dream.

Yours in Service,

Subject: limitations to sca/demos

Greetings gentles,

re: "age of chivalry" ideal

I agree whole heartedly with Awilda Halfdane.  This organization is supposed
to be fun-- for goodness sake we are spending our free time doing it.
There has to be some limitations, naturally, so that people don't get hurt
and so that the scope is not so large as to cause confusion.
Yes, we should try to get things as accurate as possible and 
research what life was really like, but we shouldn't lose sight of our 
original purpose--to have fun with our friends.  Life for women in the Middle
Ages sucked big time, unless they had lots of money (life is always easier
when you have lots of money ;-) ), extremely important family connections,
or unusual circumstances.  Most of them were in some stage of child-birth or 
child-rearing for the majority of their adult life, often risking their lives
in the process.  Not my idea of a good time.
In sum, I refuse to play a game in which my activities are much more
restricted than they are in my every-day life.

re: intro to the sca/demos

Felding has discovered that having men in tights walk around on campus 
attracted many newbies (as well as curious glances from some mundanes :-) ).
Thanks Don!

   I guess my main concern with this whole business is whether or not
you are here to have fun.  I believe in rules of safety because they
are necessary.  Other rules I take or leave and the stricter they are
the less fun I have.  If I'm going to have to watch my costume dates
or history dates every time I have an interest in studying something 
(i.e. Indian history at that same time period, making shoes, vegetables
and other such different topics) to be sure I fit in your idea of the
rules for SCA then I'm not having fun.

I and My household (those of us who attend Pennsic) will be cooking
Kosher food.  Since there may be many gentles who find themselves
with similar requirements, and since it is much easier to do such things
as a group rather than as individuals, I am offering to coordinate
Kosher food at Pennsic. (What this means depends on how many people accept
this offer.)  Those interested should contact me.  My USnail address is:

Subject: Children of Rialto

The Barony of Carolyngia seems finally to be making in-roads to this
forgotten corner by way of the Rialto. I propose to call these inductees
"children of the Rialto". Will the heralds let us put a netted shoe in
the burrough's badge. (Some freshmen found some tart's unwanted footware
abandoned by mundania's worst architecture *harvard bridge* and as it was
 obviously put there by god; it is now a cult figure)
Burroughs are organized in this barony by university. Often too small
for shires yet this is a high density area.

If the Rialto has both brothers and children, would it make more sense
as a College? Perhaps the form might even vary by kingdom.

So m'lord Justin can look for us at dance practice thursday night and
at sundays restful fighting practice we'll at least be sending that
hefty fellow who figures it's enough to take the edge off the steel.

Subject: My first SCA experience...

This is a supportive vote to the "second meeting" theory :-) My first contact
with sca was a message over a local computer network (probably the same note
that Lord William de Corbie mentioned a couple of digests ago). I didnt
bother to find out more about it, I was a little put off by the heavy emphasis
on chivalry and courtly love. I have been interested in history since I was 5 
and saw my first castle ruin, and I considered the "book ideals" of the period
far less interesting than how people really acted. This must have been in
september '84.
About 6 months later I had a period of *very* heavy interest in the merovingian
period and began to feel frustrated because reading books just wasnt enough. 
Reliving the past didnt seem such a bad idea, after all. To that end I 
contacted a friend I knew was involved (Hi Lindorm). I had already decided
on persona and a device and was firmly determined to join, and my first meeting
with the people of Nordmark was sometime in June 85. During that summer I had
the most boring job Ive ever had (working shifts making cable...(the smell..))
The only activity that took place on a regular basis was dance practice. So I
danced.
My first event was to be the first ever Visby tourney and feast. I left my last
night shift that summer, put on my rucksack, got on the bus going to the 
Gotland ferry, put an old Moody Blues tape in my walkman, and from that time
on reality was transformed. A few things stand out in from the happy blur;
meeting the first non-swedish sca persons and seeing fighting for the first 
time. That really was a thrill. I could be noted that the site for the fighting
wasnt very bad, right outside the 13th century walls of Visby...
To sum up it could be noted that I was a shire officer three months later.

My Lords and Ladies, I beg your indulgances.  I submitt for your
perusal a hastily composed ballad to the tune of "Ash Grove".
Constructive criticism is appreciated.  If any gentle finds something
offensive, please be assured t'was not my intent. 'Tis only to
provide amusement, and an excuse not to work on my Thesis.  For the benefit of
non-fighters, 6-in-1 is a pattern of chain mail knitting.
Title: Thrashed Grove by Yaakov HaMizrachi
Tune: Ash Grove

       When I was a mundane and nightly sought "a little action"
       I cruised discoes and bars 'till my cash it was spent
       Then I joined SCA, and the term we like to use is wenching
       And I tried my hand at it at every event.
       And being dashing and bold, I'd not sleep in the cold
       But each morn I'd awake in abject misery
       For I found there are maidens
       That the gods never meant for wenching!
       Pay heed all young swains and take warning by me.

       First there's the maiden whose strength marks her as a fighter
       Her developed physique makes you sure you'll have fun
       Shyly ask if she'll please take your favor with her into combat
       If she does than you might think your battle is won
       But a 6-in-1 corset, may catch hairs--or worse yet!
       And she's sure to cry "Light!" most inopportunely
       Beware of the maiden who thinks of chain mail as pajamas
       Pay heed oh young swains and take warning from me.

       And then there's the maiden whose green marks her as a herald
       research your submission if you want it to pass
       If she's ammused at the thought of some charges on a field empty
       You may play your greensleaves in a clump of tall grass
       But your sure to go deaf, from her shout of "Oyez!"
       and the whole camp shall know of your night's revelry.
       Beware of the maiden whose voice could flatten an encampment
       Pay heed oh young swains and take warning from me.

       A brewer is bouncy and her always sparkle
       She laughs long and loudly and her face is flushed pink.
       She'll invit you to sample "a little something she's been working on"
       You can feel your hopes rise as she offers a drink
       But though her strong potions, may rouse strong emotions
       They insure that you can't rouse your ability
       Beware of the maiden whose honey'd kisses are fermented mead
       Pay heed oh young swains and take warning from me.

       So I sat despondent at the close of last revell
       Then I jumped in surprise when my butt it was pinched
       A comely lass asked if I "Please could share a little tent space."
       I told her "no problem" and tried not to wince
       But my tentmate that night, was the sheerest delight
       When the dawn came I rose and I shouted with glee:
       "Oh give me the Lady who got her AoA in wenching!"
       Pay heed oh young swains and take warning from me.

Subject: Gold leaf and other stuff

In Digest #225, Deb Walks (Branwen) sent out a request for information on how
to do "real" gold leaf.

First, get yourself the following supplies:

Gesso (Liquitex makes some)
a burnisher, preferably agate (it's smooth, unlike plastic)
a book of gold leaf (at your local art supply store; you may have to special
order it)
a paintbrush, #2 or smaller
an X-acto knife
a sheet of glassine (also at the art supply store)
...and, of course, the paper you're working on and a pencil.

Sketch out the shape of the thing you want to do in gold (a letter, some
details, or whatever).  For your first try, smaller is easier.

Dip the paintbrush into the gesso and paint it into the area you just sketched.
For illuminated initials and things you want to stand out, you may want to add
a couple of coats.  Just be careful not to put air bubbles into the gesso.  Let
dry.

Next, take the X-acto knife and cut out a piece of gold leaf that is slightly
larger than the area of gesso you want to cover.  The leaf will attach itself
to the point of your knife and detach itself from the backing paper.
(This is much, much harder than it sounds.  Don't do this in front of a fan,
 don't sneeze... don't even exhale!)  If all goes well, you now have a mini-
sheet of gold leaf suspended in thin air.  Breathe gently on the gesso to
moisten the top surface so it will stick to the leaf.

Lay the leaf down on top of the gesso.  Smooth gently to avoid wrinkles.

Place a piece of glassine over the top of the leaf and rub gently with the
burnisher till the leaf sticks to the gesso.  After that, you can remove the
glassine and burnish the gold directly (again, gently!) until you get a nice
shine.

Sounds difficult?  It is... or at least I still think so.  If you want to
find some books on gold leafing techniques, you might start with Edward
Johnston's Writing, Illuminating, and Lettering.  Johnston is a 20th-century
artist (or rather, he was), but he studied a number of manuscripts.

If you'd like a bigger bibliography, I'll gladly furnish one.  So we don't 
take up all the space on this net, please send requests to me at my net
address.

Subject: Non-Europeans
Message-ID:  <8901231841.aa05680@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

I hope this discussion continues long enough for some people to do some real
 thinking about what is and isn't proper for the SCA to address and why.  I
 have been a SCA person for lo these many years, and I have never been
 comfortable with the massive emphasis on white north European culture.   I
 have been very pleased to see in recent years a growing number of central and
 eastern European personas.  I am also pleased to see the growth of Orientals
 in the SCA because they are the only significant body of non-white personas we have.
 Think about it.  How many black, Native American, Oriental, Middle Eastern and
 Jewish people do you know in the SCA?  I am a person of mixed blood
 (Cherokee-European) and I am one of the few I know.    Consider this as well:
 How many Southern Europeans (dark skinned) are there both in person, and in
 persona?  How many Moors? How many black Africans?  Ghana, Mali, and Songhay
 all flourished during our period, and traded vigourously with the Mediterranean
 world: They supplied vast quanities of gold to the mints of Italy, Spain,
 and Arabia.  They imported luxury goods, cloth, and especially salt.  The
 Portuguese mapped West Africa in the 14th century and in  1324 the
 emporer of Mali went on pilgrimage to Mecca, spending so much gold in the
 process that "it ruined the value of money." (al-Umari, quoted  in West
 Africa: Black Kingdoms, Black Peoples, London, 1987).  It is clear that
 Europe is not the parochial place a static interpretation of the SCA would imply.  



We have imposed limits.  The principle and formal ones are limits of time and
geography, specifically the period of 600 to 1600 and the continents of Europe,
Africa, and Asia.  This is the period in which the crux of the development of
the Old World ocurred.  We have essentially tribal peoples moving from loosely
organized bands into larger groups with a quasi-divine warrior king developing
further into a larger system of central government centered around and king to
a parliamentarian monarchy with an increasing participation of secular society.
At the same time religion slowly erodes and must compete with alternative ideas
as the education of the population increases.  Science begins to have a
significant impact on society by providing technological advances that free an
increasing number of people from drudgery and giving society the surplus of
goods and manhours it needs to flower.  This process was followed more or less
throughout the three continents, although China and India, being much more
ancient cultures, did not change as much as the younger kingdoms of Europe and
Africa. This is what I mean when I use the term "medieval": the transformation
of  low technology tribal  bands into educated, centrally governed people with
the resources to engage in art, science, and exploration.  There are plenty of
other definitions and uses of the term "medieval".  I do not claim mine is the
only valid one.  I am trying to point out the larger thread that ties together
what on the surface appears to be many disparate threads, and to explain why I
think non-Europeans are part and parcel of the SCA.  

The other limits are informal limits of personal prejudice.  Each of us is most
comfortable in the culture we grew up in.  For the majority of people in the 
SCA, that is north European. It is only natural that the culture of our youth
should shape our thinking as adults.  The problem is when adults fail to
realize that their world view is not the only or even the dominant view.  As a
person of mixed race I am perhaps more aware of the differences between my
culture and the culture of people around me.  I find that most people assume
that the people they meet are just like themselves.  This is a very easy
assumption in the mundane world where we all wear the same kind of clothes, eat
the same kind of food, drive the same kind of cars, and live in the same kind
of houses.  In the SCA where people are adopting different modes of dress, the
differences are very visable.   When you meet a person in a kimono it is 
obvious that you're not in Kansas anymore, but when you meet a black man 
in a suit, he looks just like you except for the minor difference
of skin color.  If you met the same black man in African clothes, you wouldn't
know how to react.  His appearence would be completely outside your experience
and the visual clues you have relied on would not be present.  Each of us is
most comfortable with what is most familiar.  Most people don't know very much
about non-Europeans.  They don't know how to react.  The solution is simple:
react according to your persona and as  your personality dictate.  They will be
doing the same.  I think a Norman knight and a Japanese samurai sizing each
other up could be a fun encounter.   After all, they both follow the same
feudal code of  loyalty, courage, and honor, they just express it differently.

Dear lady Awilda Halfdane:

How can you call my interpretation of the SCA "narrow"? Is it narrow to want
a society that studies an era of 1,000 years of Western European history? No
way. It is a very broad view! If we go any broader, there is a risk that we
will become a Society of Creative Anything. If we try to accommodate every-
one, we will end up pleasing nobody. If we try to create *everybody's* Dream,
we will end up with *no* Dream. We will lose our identity and our theme, and
instead of a dynamic future for the SCA, we will see the rise of more and more
subgroups with narrow themes, until (horror!) we get the British situation
where anachronists are divided in numerous small, isolated extremist groups
of Normans Only, Vikings Only, Tudors Only, etcetera. Let us choose the middle
way and allow *a lot*, but not *too much*.

Who has asked for an authentic reproduction of the Middle Ages? Certainly not
I. The SCA was created to depict the Middle Ages as they should have been, 
i.e. without slavery, plague, oppression of women, rampant ignorance and
cruelty. I am not looking for reality, but for the Age of Chivalry. This is
difficult to define exactly, but it involves the ideals of medieval Europe,
centering on the High Middle Ages (AD 1000-1500) - but allowing for some things
which strictly speakuzng blong outside that time, because they still belong
in the same cultural and traditional environment. This re-creation involves
all that was good and admirable about those times. Their ideals of courtesy,
chivalry, honor, hospitality. Their arts and sciences. Their pageants and
ceremonies. 

It is an extreme exaggeration to claim that Europe had regular communications
with the Far East in the Middle Ages. Most of the trade was done via caravans,
where the goods would change hands many times before it reached Europe. It would
*not* be sold on the local market by an oriental! The direct trade which began
in the 16th century was done exclusively by European ships. Chinese, Indian
and Japanese ships did not sail to Europe, and the European merchants brought
back goods, not people. The oriental individuals who actually travelled to
Europe were *extremely* few.

Europeans were ~fascinated by oriental products - I'm sure my Norman persona
would not mind wearing silk! Now, just as the Europeans had some occasional
contacts with the Far East, the SCA could very well have contacts with other
groups, such who re-create non-European cultures. We could exchange knowledge
and an occasional embassy. But it is essential that those cultures officially
remain little-known, half-mythical and remote at our events, as they would have
been to medieval lords and ladies. The fact that some few orientals appeared 
in Europe at the very end of the SCA period does not justify a large (and
growing) percentage of SCA members having such personas - unless the whole
theme of the Society is changing.

Why should you be prevented from doing anything with the knowledge of oriental
things that you have got through TI? You can do a lot with it! Europeas in
the Middle Ages did. They wore imported fabrics, and they developed ideas from
oriental art. You could do that with a European persona. Your persona could
even travel to the Far East, like Marco Polo, and upon your return you could
write books about it (in the SCA, you would not be charged with heresy). But
you could hardly become an oriental person, dress and behave like one, if
you wanted to live in Europe.

Milady Sophia Ficino:

Thanks for your comments. Your parallel between religios ceremonies and SCA
events is an interesting idea. I believe you have a point there, but I don't
quite agree with the analogy. The cult is a ritual drama which depicts certain
historic or mythic events in the remote past. It aims at commemoration of those
events and at communion with the deity. It does not aim to create an occasion
for people to live in their dreams.

The point is that our Dreams unite us. We dream of the Age of Chivalry. No 
two people have identical Dreams, but as long as we share the same cultural
tradition, the similarities are enough to unite us. If our Dreams are too
different, we will drift apart.

It is not a question of dogmas or canon laws, but of what we bear in our
hearts. Since a Buddhist ceremony doesn't express Christian ideas, the 
Christian people will go elsewhere - and vice versa. If someone tried to
create a ceremony that would express the essence of all religions, he would
soon find that he had in fact created a new religion (which would not express
any of the others!). The SCA is doing something like this by trying to fit
everybody's Dreams into its world. Soon it may find that it no longer depicts
anybody's Dream, that it no longer re-creates *any* culture or era, but has
simply created a never-never-land of its own, with little relation to
anything else.

Subject: First encounters with the SCA

My first encounter with the SCA was nothing like quicksand; I didn't even have
time to sink in.

Before I discovered the wonder of electronic scribes, I was a math-and-science
teacher at a high school in Wrentham, MA.  The third-period sophomores were
that exceptional kind of class who recognized that "talking back to the teacher"
can mean dialogue, too, and we spent some time talking about our D&D games.

One of the seventh-period kids had an older sister who was a senior.  One day
she came in with a copy of the Carolingian newsletter and said, "These people
did a demo for our mini-con last year.  You should join them."

I didn't get any reply from the chronicler, but my first encounter with a
"real" SCAdian came about a month later, when I met then-Baroness Morgiane of
the Bridge at Merlin's Closet in Providence.  I forget how many hours I spent
there, but I came out of the store with a penannular brooch in my hands and a
head full of manic ideas.

The rest, as they say, is history.  Finding no shire where I lived (but that's a
very long story), I ended up founding one; it eventually became the southern 
half of what is now Quintavia.  I cooked the first five or six events I went to
and never saw much otherwise, so I consider my first real event to be a Feast
of Simple Fare (this would have been April of AS XVI, I think).  There I met
some of the things that were to become permanent parts of my life: Salaamallah's
mustard soup, the Dargason, and Clann O Choda.

Dear William,

I think you have an unnecessarily narrow interpretation of the scope of the 
SCA.  I agree we need some kind of limits to provide a framework for our
studies, but the "Age of Chivalry" seems a little narrow for me.  As an
educated female I am not willing to particiapate in an authentic reproduction
of that era because if I did I would have to be an ignorant, married, poor
woman.  In fact, ninety percent of us would have to give up our fine clothes
and titles if we were going to confine ourselves to _reality_.

I am perfectly willing to allow Moors, Arabs, colonials, Chinese, and Japanese
into the SCA because Europeans did have regular communication and trade with
them.  The Vikings raided from North Africa to Afganistan, the Silk Road
carried a vigorous commerce through several centuries, Crusades were fought,
Crusader kingdoms founded and fell, Chinese and Japanese Christians
traveled to Rome during the 16th century, the Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese
caried on commerce with Japan, and the Dutch continued that commerce even after
Japan was closed to Westerners.  Many products were imported to Europe from
Asia in these years:  roses and azaleas, the compass, gunpowder, spices, silk,
clocks, and a good many more items. 

Your remark that if a Chinese were allowed to visit court once every ten years,
that would be realistic, is completely specious.  If we're looking for reality,
then we ought to establish family dynasties to provide us with our royalty.
Instead we have Crown Tourneys every six months.  

I'm also not too keen on your implication that it's all right to read about
things Oriental in TI, as long as you don't actually do anything with that
knowledge.  SCA is an educational organization.  If people are curious about
things Oriental, they ought to be allowed to indulge that curiosity, and to
share the results of their research with the rest of us.  Even if the subject
does not appeal to you personally, you can still appreciate the effort and
enthusiasm that went into it.

From Mary_Thomas's_Embroidery_Book, Gramercy Publishing, 1936, (and commonly 
found in used book stores), on Jacobean embroidery:

	"Jacobean embroidery is a rhapsody of the Restoration.... The glorious
	colours were strongly influenced by the embroideries and printed 
	fabrics of the Orient brought to England during this period, and the
	dominant motif--that of the Tree of Life [central asian, mostly 
	Persian & Indian]--was enthusiastically adopted by the  English
	embroiderers."

I use this as a simple example, abeit a little late period, of a phenomenon 
common to European society--the fashionable adoption of foreign motifs and 
ideas through the "mythography of trade," dating formally (at least in written 
form) at least as far back as the craze for Orientalia sparked by Marco Polo's
fanciful account of his Cathay journey in the latter half of the thirteenth
century.  Upon publication it "spread throughout Italy in a few months" and 
was the foundation for Western mythology about the orient from that time on.
Columbus writes of Polo's detailed description of the riches and location of 
Japan as one of the inspirations for his journey west.  Even earlier, it was
the inspiration for the breaking of the traditional Islamic monopolies of 
trade overland with central Asia.

Thus, I tend to agree with Ser William, that my interest in the Orient is in 
mythology rather than history--in the influence of the orient on my own 
culture.

On the other hand, we are also really recreating not the history, but the 
*mythology* of our periods.  There is more of Malory than history in our 
perspectives, for the most part.  Although I find this taken a little too far, 
sometimes (I'd rather see Launcelot recreated than Conan or Corwin of 
Amber--so call me a snob), I think that this is the spirit of our 
"recreation," which is not re-creation at all, but CREATION prima.  The reason 
that oriental persona of some sorts bother some of us is that the image of the 
dream--the mythology of the parallel "history" we create--is disrupted by what 
is perceived as a dissonant note.

Since one of my primary interests is theology, let me make a parallelism: in 
religious practice, rituals are constructed (like SCA events) to set aside a 
time which steps aside from the profane (mundane) world for some period of 
time to live in the time of the god(ess{es}).  A ritual "returns" to the 
timeless time of the mythology of the religion, be it the rebirth of the god 
who grants life (Spring Equinox), the last supper of the god in his earthly
incarnation (Easter), the age of chaos before the imposition of the modern 
social order (Saturnalia, Feast of Fools, Hallowe'en).

Pardon my digression into matters religious, but I would draw your attention 
to this point:  in a very *real* way, events create an outlet for a sort of 
sacred festival, and though these festivals are *not* religious in nature, 
they are unmistakeably religious in *structure*, according to the academic 
definitions of theology.

Therefore I predict that, short of coming up with a strict DOGMA or CANON LAW 
(which we already have the beginnings, however unenforced), so long as there 
is not *one* dream, we are never going to resolve the question of what is 
proper within our society mythology.  Our mythology, being a high-context 
mythology of concensus (and not dictated strictly by heirarchy and authority, 
despite any BOD "guidelines" or royal preference), is probably best left 
self-regulating and amorphous.

I don't mean to quash discussion on the subject.  I just want to express (long 
windedly :-) that I think that anyone looking for an ANSWER isn't going to 
find one.

At least some Oriental mail was looped more than once for each ring and was not
riveted or welded.  Soldering would be almost as weak as butted joints.  I have
never figured out how one could weld mail without a blowtorch, however; any
hints?

As the result of some incidents, one which he observed, the past Society
Marshall essentially banned the particpation of the Tuchux as a group in the
fighting at Pennsic XVIII.  He required that all Tuchux fighters at Pennsic 
XVIII be authorized by SCA marshalls.  He was succeeded last fall by Duke Sir
Erin of Trimaris, who is well known to the TuChux.  Erin and the new East
Kingdom Earl Marshall have arranged for these conditions to be met in the
East, and they are also being met in the Middle.

Before getting too excited contact the East Kingdom EM (sorry, don't have
his address yet; he takes over at 12th Night and his address is not yet in
the Pikestaff) or call me.  They have been working with the various clans
in the East Kingdom and the EM things that things are going fairly well.

I personally feel that the basic problem is that the two groups play a 
different game and that many of the incidents are due to conflicts between
standards for combat.  This does not make the conflicts any safer, which is
the whole issue here.

If you (or anyone) wants to influence the rules for Pennsic XVIII, write to
Their Highnesses of the Middle and the East.  My understanding is that the
rules will be locked in by Feb. 1.  Current discussion is around an archery
shoot with fixed targets spaced from 70 yards in; an archery clout shoot
at 100 yards; the Woods Battle to have three banners, two in posession of
the defenders who will have 20 minutes for set-up; two Champion's Battles
with the King's Champions being belted/royal peers and the Queen's 
Champions being unbelted (no royal targets, thank God!); Bridge Battle
following Sir Alexander of Caithness' suggeston (three bridges, center
bridge with an island too big for a Calontir shieldwall; battle won by
holding two of three banners with the banner on the center bridge being
unmovable).

The increasing differences between the Middle Kingdom and other Kingdoms
will make the war rules more onerous than before for other kingdoms.  The
conventions for combat will be approximately the same; face thrusts, long
poles or spears will not be allowed in the war points but will hopefully
be used at times during the previous week.

None of the above two paragraphs is yet been cast in stone by the two
Kingdoms, but I think it does summarize the current discussion.

Subject: first contact, second contact, third contact,...

	My first contact with the SCA was probably at a Boskone around 1975.  
I don't really remember much about it except noticing that for people who were 
doing recreation costuming, I saw a lot of modern materials in the costumes 
(perhaps I was doomed from the start? :-).

	However, my first (exceedingly) personal encounter with the SCA was at 
some sort of small event at MITgard (MIT) in 1978.  I was 18, female, and had
a nicer mixture of concave and convex curves in those days.  My first lasting 
impression of the SCA was a group of rather macho/agressive (chivalrous?) 
slavering engineering students trying to impress each other with the amount of 
artifice they could put into picking up the new pretty wench.  (I hesitate to 
speculate which of my current contemporaries in Carolingia might have been in 
that company...:-)

	I think this might serve as a warning to people associated with 
college groups, though, seriously.  I had *no* interest in the SCA for about 
seven years after that.  It's true, I travelled in a lot of overlapping 
circles. I've even lived in a household where I was the only non-scadian adult
(unless you count Skia as a Marklander/Yelmsviking...).  

	Another true confession...

Message-ID:  <8901211254.aa07869@SMOKE.BRL.MIL>

Hello everybody,

Since I'm the new kid on the block, I figured I'd better introduce myself.  I
joined the SCA unofficially when I was fifteen.  They came to my high school
and did a demo.  Thereafter I attempted and failed to transport myself to the
University.  Next year they came back and did a demo again.  This time I and my
friends had licenses.  We took ourselves to the weekly meetings for dancing and
socializing at the Barony of the Northwoods, Middle Kingdom.  I began going to
events, ranging far and wide through Ontario, Michigan, and even Iowa.  My
first war was Pennsic VII.  I've only missed one War since then.  I haven't
been terribly active in the last few years, my health has kept me pretty much
housebound.  Now that I'm doing much better, I want to get back into the SCA,
but it's like being a new person again.  I've forgoten a lot, and a lot has
changed.  What's page school all about?  Back when I was active "page" was a
term referring to pubescent children.  And "paragraph" was a term referring to
small children.  Now there apparently is some formal organization of children.
Very strange.  It used to be that people in the SCA didn't have children.  Now
I have one of my own.  Tempis fugit.  

Personawise I have been a half Scottish, half Viking, half raider, half trader
named Awilda Halfdane for a very long time.  Currently I am indulging my
fascination for pearls and am evolving into Novgorod Rus persona.  Vikings have
to settle down somewhere, eventually.  I also take sidetrips into Japanese and
other persona.  My husband is completely new to the SCA.  He's been to a Twelth
Night and Pennsic War and is already halfway through a hauberk of chainmail and
is weaving a tartan.  His persona is Scottish.  We're looking for contacts in
our local area (Belcamp, MD).  We'd also like to find Marklanders, and a
Japanese group if possible.  

On the subject of Rus, I don't have access to very good research facilities
here in Belcamp.  I'd greatly appreciate any information people can give me on
11th century Rus, preferably Novogorod, but any kind will do.  I am in
particular trying to figure out if the underdress is a chemise type with a
gathered neck or else is a straight tunic.  I also want to know about women's
headresses.  What were they made out of? and what kind of shape were they using
at this early period?

Yours in service, 
Awida Halfdane

 My meeting was via a slightly long and only a little torturious route.
A friend of mine in the Dorm I was living in had a long (and varied) 
history with the SCA, and managed to get me interested (it didn't take 
much, mind you).
 I went with him to an event in Eugene, OR (The Barony of Adiantum) 

called Egil's (A major tourney in An Tir). It was... well... boring 
for me. But I stayed with it as he founded a campus group (The Freehold 
of Turis Nimborum, Oregon St. Univ.).
 The next year my shire (Coeur du Val) was hosting May Crown, but
due to TYC, it had been merged with Egil's. CrEgils (The brekfast of 
Champions, as we came to call it) was, to me, a large event. Two tourneys, 
with over 45 fighters in the first and 70+ in the second, not to mention 
all the goings-on of a Crown event.
 Shortly after arriving with the Autocrat it became obvious that we 

needed someone on the gate. I (ahem) volunteered. That weekend I spent 
somewhere over 48 hours on the gate and roving patrol (it was a 3 day 
event).  Shortly after that, the good people of Coeur du Val accepted

Milord Randell Jesup, here is a reply to your posting (Id 5725@cbmvax.UUCP)
concerning "non-Europeans revisited":

I think you seriously misconstrue what I have written. Your flames miss
their target, milord!

You write: "What about the articles in TI about Japanese costuming and..."

Sure, that's exactly what I said: There have been articles about oriental
things in SCA publications. Westerners in the Middle Ages were probably
curious about such things, just as I may be - despite my Norman persona.
But the existence of such texts does not imply that oriental things are
the subject of study on the SCA, in the same way that the Age of Chivalry
is. Read *CORPORA* and you will find that the *definition* of the SCA does
not mention anything else than pre-17th Century Western Culture.

You write: "Who needs a "theory"? Also, many have long explanations of
why they might be in europe, etc. Also, the middle ages _as they should
have been_, not as they were."

I believe that we do need some kind of theory to make our re-creation believe-
able. I don't go to SCA events to meet my buddies in fancy dress. I go there
to travel in time to the Sge of Chivalry, which is (to me) Europe ca 600 -
1600. Since most orientals make up stories to explain their presence, it
seems that they accept that this is the geographic location. They are in fact
aware of that they are out-of-place in the SCA, otherwise no such stories
would be needed.

"The Middle Ages as they should have been" can be construed to include just
about anything (motorcycles, television, computers...), but I'm sure that
that is not the intention of most of those who use that phrase. It does not
mean the introduction of alien things into the Age of Chivalry, but rather
the removal (or omission) of certain bad things from it - e.g. the plague.

You write: "Some rules are OK, strict rules know no end ("Your costume isn't
correct for a 13th century scot - the colors are wrong! you can't play!")."

I agree that the rules must not become too strict. I am not part of the
authenticity police, and I do not want to limit personas to "12th century
Norman only". Where did you find any such notions in any of my postings

I favor *very* liberal rules, allowing personas from all over Europe and
possibly as far east as Palestine (since the Crusaders had a kingdom there).
I favor *incredibly* liberal rules that allow personas from several centuries
of medieval history. I don't ask for strict rules, just for *some* rules,
to create *some* kind of believability in our re-creation of the Age of
Chivalry. And I have pointed out that as far as I'm concerned, Samurai and
Chinese and North American Indians don't belong there.

It's quite possible to argue that there were humans in Australia in A.D. 1200,
who lived in a Stone Age society. Does that make them part of the Age of
Chivalry? No! Does that make it reasonable to have stone-age people mingling
with medieval lords & ladies at SCA revels? No! Even in Disneyland, they have
different areas for different themes - and Stone Age culture is not part of
the SCA theme. Nor is Zen Buddhism or Chinese culture.

The limits ought not to be set by time or geography, but by culture. The
culture we want to re-create is that of the armored knight and his lady,
with feudalism, courtly love, chivalry and all that. Medieval Western
Europe, amen.

I don't want a communality of personas like that of certain subgroups. The
co-existence of 8th century Norse and 16th century Tudors is no real problem
for me. They are all part of the same cultural and traditional environment.
The presence of large numbers of orientals, on the other hand, is a problem.
Sorry, but nothing anyone can say could possibly convince me that such
people belong here. Some people on the net have tried to sanction their
presence by drawing attention to the trade contacts, Marco Polo and other
such things. Sure, let one Chinese attend court once in ten years - and you
might get something like reality...

And finally, a rephrasing of my previous request, since milord Randell seems
not to have understood my meaning: *Please* transform yourselves into
something that belongs in the Age of Chivalry...

Have you noticed how similar joining the SCA is to stepping in quicksand?  The
interval between putting your toe in what you thought was the water and being up
to your neck can be extremely short.

I'd been peripherally aware of the SCA for some time (I went by fighting
practice regularly) but the attraction of  people hitting each other over the
head with sticks was so minimal that I didn't even make a conscious decision not
to look into it.

A couple of years ago, at the student activities fair, I went by the SCA table,
and happened to talk with the people sitting there who, oddly enough, *weren't*
engaged in hitting each other over the head with sticks.  They told me about
some of the *other* things that SCAdians did.

(I enjoyed talking with them, too.  I think I'd subconsciously expected SCAdians
to be the sort of people who sat around reading historical romances, but it
turned out they read science fiction, just as you and I.)

As it happened, my schedule had gotten turned around in such a way that I hadn't
been able to make it to folk dancing for close to a year at that point, and I
was suffering from withdrawal.  I showed up at the next dance practice.
Thursdays.

Not long after this I started attending consort practice, which was held just
before (or during) fighting practice.  Sundays.

I still wasn't interested in fighting, but I was curious about archery, and some
three or four months after I joined the SCA I started attending archery practice
regularly.  The bow was a borrowed 25-pounder and the arrows were from the
"Baronial arrow" collection, meaning that I was shooting six 50-pound arrows of
assorted lengths, but it was fun.  Archery is particularly enjoyable because of
the degree to which you control your progress.  You can progress in any skill by
putting in enough practice time, but with archery this process is under much
more focused control.  You can look at the way you shoot and say "I'm doing X
wrong, and if I fix it my score will go up ten points."  And you do and it does.
 Tuesdays.

It wasn't too long after that that the singing group, The Debatable Quartet (so
called because there are about a dozen of us), started up.  Mondays.

Wednesdays were a crazy-quilt:  Barony meeting once a month, officers' meeting
once every two months, Alchemists' guild once every three months.

As I said, quicksand.
Oh, and writing my dissertation in my spare time.

--Dani of the Seven Wells

P.S  Things have gotten more sane in the past few months:  We lost our indoor
range, so Tuesdays are free till the weather gets better, we moved consort
practice to Thursday, before dancing, so Sundays are free, and I'm no longer
attending officers' meeting once every two months.  WHICH GOES TO SHOW that the
SCA needn't take up too much of your time if you don't let it.

Subject: Cattle Raiding at Pennsic

In Digest #224, James Anderson wrote that cattle raiding at Pennsic was (my
paraphrase) invented to offset the boredom from the rainstorm.

Actually, cattle raiding has a long and glorious history.  Back at Pennsic 13,
members of Clann O Choda (a large Celtic household mostly centered around the
Dragonship Haven/New Haven area) decided to engage in some period sport.  (In
Ireland in the dark Ages, cattle raiding was both a game and a means of
livelihood.) We simply got together one night and made a big show of "sneaking"
around the War site, looking for cattle to raid.  (There weren't any that year,
but we had a great time: "We're goin' on a cattle raid, doo dah, doo dah...")

The next year (Pennsic 14), we raided the first real cow.  There was a man
living next to Dark Horde who had a large wooden "Sacred Chao" and a pig in 
front of his camp.  We asked him ahead of time if we could raid his livestock,
and he graciously said yes. Of course, style is everything -- so we raided the
cow and the pig during a SCAdian wedding procession (mine).  He made a great
show of running out of his camp and exclaiming,"Oh no!  My cow!  My pig!  Stop,
thieves!".  We carried the "livestock" around with us till after the wedding,
then returned them to him.  Thus was a tradition born.

Subject: Tuchux question



	Hey does anybody know what the real story about the
Tuchux banning and such for the Pennsic is?  I heard a rumor 
that we are allowed to go to the war but we just can't fight together.
I am unsure what this means.  If 2 or more Tuchux are found standing
near each other will a hold be called and the marshalls force us
to seperate?
	If I cannot go to the war and fight with my Dog Brothers then
the Pennsic is not worth all the trouble and travel involved.  If this
is the way we are going to be treated then I will just hang up my
armor and toss my swords onto a fire as a symbolic ending to my
relationship to the SCA.
	So if some of you knowlegeable folk can tell me what is really
going on this year I would really appreciate it.  Come up to the
Tuchux camp and ask for me and we will hoist a few ales together.

Subject: How I met the SCA...

        I also fit the pattern of a 'first contact'.  When I was about 12, my
parents were both working at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.  One day, when I
was hanging around campus, I ran into what must have been either a small
indoor event, or a fighting practice with spectators in garb.  I remember
being quite impressed by a 6-month old child in beautiful (Tudor?) garb.
        Flash forward to my senior year in high school.  A friend who had
graduated the previous year was attending Brandeis and told me about these
"weird friends of his" in the SCA there.  Due to one thing and another, I
ended up goingto Brandeis myself, but he didn't get around to introducing me
to these weird friends for a while.
        One day, I was walking back from the local comic book shop with my
head in a comic (Micronauts #3, if I remember), when I looked up and chanced
to see four people in garb on a small greensward.  I had an instant impression
that these would be good people to know, and I turned out to be right.  One of
these people was Justin duCouer, a frequent poster to the Rialto...
The brandeis Demo was a week later, and my first event a few weeks after that.

   catalogs do not yet have them.
 
  However, I have a catalog reference for AULOS plastic recorders (Alto,

Subject: veggies

de re Rebbecca the Contraries request for veggies:

1st for your amusment and edification a list of those plants that Platina 
(i.e. Bartolomeo de Sacchi di Piadena) in "De honesta Volupate," VE 1475, 
considers to be "eddible greens":

lettuce, endive, bugloss or oxtoung, mint, catmint, fennel, parsly,  purslain,
 rosemary, mallow, chicory, saxifrage, pimpernel, sorrel, asparagus (boiled), 
lupin (cooked like asparagus, or fried).  most of these are eaten raw with oil 
and vineger.  

under "strong seasonings" he lists:

garlic, onion, squilla[?], leeks, fennel, cumin, aniseed, poppyseed, 
coriander[seed, i think], mint, celery, thyme, pennyroyal, thistles, sage, 
basil, rue, colewort, nasturtium, savory, catmit, dill, oregeno, chervil, 
marjoram, elecampagne, sisymbrium [?], Marubium[?], southernwood[?], hyssop, 
parsly, and wormwood


later he lists:

Broad bean, chick peas, peas, lentils, vetch, lupin [probably the seeds], hemp
 [seeds],[all of these would have been used to make bread or pottage] 
elder [flower], gourd, spinich, rapum turnip [rape], other turnips, 
blitum and bleta [?? greens], and cabbage.  he spends little time on how to 
prepare these, and much on in what ways they are usefull medicinally

questions:  Has any one tried any of these (hi shava)?  Some of them (wormwood) 
are poisonous, others (rue) smell unpleasant, and many i have never heard of.

more questions:  How does *your* group deal with vegetarians?  We have a 
significant population of vegetarians and kosher who reduce to ovo-lacto 
vegetarian.  Since, as R the C. pointed out, most of the recipies are for meat 
dishes and most of the vegie pottages we do have were cooked with meat (or 
almond milk), i find it difficult to come up with a good period menue that 
will give them enough to eat.  Also, do you have a price break for 
vegetarians? (carol de tressecon, at the last carolingian university serve 
what was accurately if missleadingly billed as "a feast of seasonal fare". the 
season was lent!!  it was very interesting, and all delicious, but we're not 
sure how many people would have come if they had known what they were in for)

finaly:  does anyone know how one manages to go into a kitchen and scrub pots, 
scour roasting pans, mop floors, and clean stovetops for an hour and emerge 
looking like a lady and not a scullery maid?

You will find that most Japanoligists disagree with you.  Check out
Jansen and Hall's *Instituions of Medieval Japan* for a good collection
of essays on the subject.  I have writen a paper demonstrating that
Kamakura Japan is exactly parallel to England during the War of the Roses.
(Paper and Bibliography available on request.)
The real question is, does 'Medieval' describe a length of time
(600-1600), a system of government (a diverse warrior caste controlling
the resources in the name of some central authority), or is it so
specific as to apply only to Europe.  If the last, than Medieval is a
useless term, as the case it applies to is so specific as to not require
a special term.

Markland is one of several other Medieaval recreation groups on the US East
coast, mostly in the mid-atlantic region (NY south to Virginia). As Randell
said, they, and several others, do do some set fighting with live steel
weapons. For random fighting they use similar weapons as the SCA (well, one
of the other groups uses something between a boffer and a SCA weapon, e.g.
padded rattan). There is also at least one group that recreates Cavaleer,
including fencing in the round using modern fencing weapons, I think that
counts as live steel.

Several of these groups developed in parallel with the SCA and have visited
back and forth since we found out about each other. The rest, I forget
exactly which ones, split from the SCA for various reasons, some I know,
others I don't. Sigh. Anyway this is not the forum to discus them in,
really.

The choreographed stuff is done _very_ carefully. They know what those
weapons can do. The fencing is done with safety limits, as is SCA fencing,
that gives about the same chance of survival as mundane fencing.

I'm not sure what is meant by proper, I've seen butted mail in museums.
Remember, the closure is pretty time intensive, and butted is usually "good
enough." Of course, riveted or welded mail lasts a lot longer.

There are two types of welded chain mail. The first, which was used in the
Middle Ages, is forge welded. Like riveted mail, the links are cut to
overlap at the ends, but instead of flattening, drilling and riveting, you
pop that puppy out of the forge, lace it into place, whomp on it until you
have a weld, and quench it.

The more modern way is to make a section of butted mail, with maybe a
slight overlap, and then zap the links with a spot welder at the closure.
While still pretty boring and labor intensive, it is easier than forge
welding or riveting (faster, too). How does it hold up? Well the aventail on
my bassinet hasn't had a split ring yet. It was done by Master Master Knute
the Nut more than 6 years ago.

The second comment was "How I joined the SCA." Can you say "dragooned?" I
knew you could. I started talking to the guy accross the hall in college (he
later became my roommate, hi George!), it sounded like fun, but I didn't
have time. Four months later, I was working on the local newsletter, the Pale
to most folks ;-), and organizing two midweek fighting practices so I could 
get authorized quick. (I wasn't authorized for Pensic 7 even though I tried.
I guess you shouldn't try to authorize after cooking on the 6am to 2pm
shift.) Six months later I was squired to the chronicler, an established
member of the Northwoods Barony, Middle Kingdom, and traveling most
weekends. Wow!

Thats more than enough for now.

 How I Joined the SCA (or how it found me...)

 Let's see...I've been in for about a year and a half now, so my memory might
 be a little fresher than some of the "old timers"--although I doubt ANYONE
 could forget...

 I'd been at Ball State for about 3 or 4 weeks.  After attending class a little, I realized I needed some more supplies, so I headed to the bookstore.  Well, on my way in I caught a glance at this video being shown involving guys fighting--I stopped to look...well, the people at the booth started to recruit and we got into an interesting discussion--due to the fact that I still (and did) work at aliving history museum, and was trained in half the arts practiced in the SCA.   They threatened to tie me up an

d drag me to a meeting, but I said I'd come willingly.  About a month later I attended my first event--two months later I was made an officer, and the rest is history (no pun intended)--as they say...

In Service to the Dream,
 
I remain,

Subject: observations, etc.

I have been reluctant of late to post because of the volume, but I think 
what I have to say is of sufficient difference from the trend of discussion
to be of use.  First, I'd like to congratulate Arron Renyard on his 
appointment to the office of (West) Kingdom Constable.  A stable constable he 
is, and a welcome change from his predecessor.  

Secondly, just an observation:
At West Kingdom 12th night Coronation, I recalled some of the discussions
going on upon the Rialto, and I paid more attention to those around me and
their garb.  I spotted only two people whose garb was late enough to be
called 'cavalier', ten or so real Rennaisance types, a fellow from the 
Russian steppes, and a few Arabs.  The VAST majority of people were garbed 
between the ages of 1000 AD and, say, 1550, and central European to boot.
Oh yeah, a couple Landsknecht too.  The few times I've seen anyone show up 
in American Indian garb, they only did it once.  A few Japanese appear at
events, including one person (whom I do not know personally) who sets up 
an incredible Japanese encampment.  Many people will wear Japanese or
middle-eastern garb to wars and hotter tourneys for comfort.  Our gracious
Princess Siobhan is an accomplished belly-dancer, and at tourneys she'll be
either in Irish or Middle-easetern garb.  Personas are not meant to be rigid.
Frankly, I fail to see what all the fuss is about.

Question to those in other kingdoms:  How often do you see recreations of
the headdresses of the thirteenth-fifteenth centuries?  This 12th night I 
noticed a lot more ladies with these elaborate headdresses, and it really
added to the atmosphere.  I personally dislike wearing hats, headbands, and 
headdresses, but these looked very good.  

The word 'eric' is still sometimes used, often incorrectly (as incorrectly
as something we invented can get :-)) to mean the entire fighting field.
This has been going out of style, to the great relief of those named Eric.
The name Eric and its variants is the second most common name in the West, 
second only to Steven and its variants.  

This only included to indulge my own vanity:
I got dragged to a tourney after hanging around with fringe types for a
while.  They forgot to bring food.  I wore a white skirt with a blue cotton 
shirt that looked like a tunic, and a white sash to match the skirt.(!) I got
gently informed that this was uncool, by a duke getting up in court and
ranting about white and whitish things being tied about the waists of those
who were not knights.  However, Duke James Greyhelm, who is graceful on the
field as well as gracious, won the list, and during evening court the 
Baron and Baroness of the Westermark came forward to swear fealty at sunset,
with Genevieve's knee-lenth golden hair flowing onto her train as she knelt,
and they were the most noble-looking thing I'd ever seen.  The acoustics of 
that site gave great echo to the hurrahs, and I floated around with visions 
of fluttering pennons and dramatic swordplay for a week afterward.  I was 
16 at the time.  

Still smiling at those visions,

Subject:  Gray sock


A while back we were telling SCA stories, here is one I heard a long while ago
while I was rather intoxicated so here is what I remember of it:

There was once a lord who lived in the downtown area of a large southern city.
Now this lord as many members of the society do had a fascination with weapons.
He had all sorts of weapons, many of which he kept on his living room wall. He
had axes, morning stars, maces, daggers, polearms, several swords, many many
different and lovely implements of destruction, but his pride and joy, the
star of his collection a truly marvelous katana. This ancient long sword from
japan was the envy of all his friends, made long ago by a master in Japan. The
lord was fastidious about caring for his weapon, keeping it sharp as only
ancient katana can be sharp. He kept it oiled and clean, placing it in a case
above his couch. Now this being the downtown section of a large southern city
there were in existence varlets, rogues, thieves and burglars. Now some of
these less savory types did choose one night to assail the lord's abode. Now
on this night when the less savory types did choose to assail the lord's abode
the lord, being a sensible sort, had learned early on that during the summer in
large southern cities to sleep in the state he was born in. And so snoozing, au
natural, he head a creaking sound, as if someone were attempting to open his
back door with a prybar. He arose and proceeded to don the only garments handy,
to wit a pair of old gray socks that rumor has were once white. So accoutered he
proceeded downstairs to investigate. On arriving at the lower landing he found
that not only did it appear that someone was indeed attempting to pry open his
rear door but that someone was also attempting to open his front door. Now here
the lord had to make a choice, the front door was locked but it had a rather
insecure lock, while the rear door was securely barred. He figured that he had
at most a few minutes before the front door was opened and perhaps a few more
before the rear succumbed. And knowing the police in this city would not get
there before a day or two, he decided that he had to take matters into his own
hand. So thinking he reached for his treasured blade which hung above his
couch and stood ready to receive the varlet before the front door. He succeeded
in forcing the lock and as the door opened, saw the worthy standing in front
of him. He immediately decided to attack, rushing upon our lord, carrying a
blunt instrument which he had brought with him. The intruder rushed forward,
swinging a baseball bat over his head. The lord dodged the deadly swing, and
struck at the robber, severely lacerating said foeman's epidermis and causing hi
m
to howl in agony. At this point the criminals at the rear door succeeded in
forcing it. Now good gentles I ask you to imagine the scene before the
scurrilous rogues, they had expected a nice easy robbery, what they found was
a large naked man in gray socks holding a dripping sword over a fallen
confederate who whimpered and bled on the floor. The lord darkly growled to
the suddenly pale interlopers "Get out of my house." The thieves then
proceeded to set new land speed records exiting the house. Alas all is not
happy though good readers, the lord, being a kindly sort, called the police and
an ambulance for the fallen intruder. They arrived and picked up the fallen
villain. The lord thought it was over and done with, when several days later he
received a subpoena, the thief was suing the lord for mental anguish, causing
permanent physical harm, and interfering with his livelihood. It seems that
the thief had a large scar running the length of his chest, had lost partial
use of his right arm below the shoulder and total use of his left arm below the
elbow. When taken before the judge, they each told their stories, after a short
deliberation the judge came forth and decided that the lord was indeed in the
right and since the criminal was in the process of of committing a felony, to
wit attempted murder, he deserved what he got, though he did caution the lord
that it ever happened again to make sure that the blow caused damage that was a
bit more "permanent".

As far as I know, the cattle thieving was a pretty spontaneous affair.  I think
it was largely spurred on by the boredom with the rain on one rather damp
evening.  Nothing like slipping around in the mud with a pair of plywood bulls
on your head.  Boy did I freeze.

	Who needs a "theory"?  Also, many have long explanations of why
they might be in europe, etc.  Also, it the middle ages _as they should have
been_, not as they were.  Where are all the peasants?  The Plague?  People
differ on how they should have been, and their personas sometimes
reflect this (rather more than most historical purists think).  I personally
have two personas, and tend to use whichever is more appropriate (or whichever
I have clean garb for :-).  One is japanese, one is 1400's english.

	Such subgroups do exist: Norseland (all vikings), tuchux (what they
are is up for question :-), the mongols whose name escapes me at 4am,
etc.

	As for your 12th century french court, doesn't it look a little
strange already with 16th century fops, 8th century vikings, 15th century
english, 10th century celts, 13th century russians, etc, etc, in it?
If you want a 12th century french court, you aren't likely to get one in the
SCA.  People who want a commanality of personae form subgroups, like the
Norselands (vikings).  The only SCA group I know of that is close to what you
want is the Barony in sweden.

Subject: The Rolls Ethereal

Well, February is approaching, and I'm accumulating enough changes to make
it worthwhile to put out a new edition of the Rolls Ethereal, the "phone
book" for the net-based SCA. Anyone who is on The Net (that is to say,
Inter/Use/BIT/Arpa/Etc nets) is encouraged to send in an entry, so that
people can have a way of getting in touch with you. Also, people whose
information has changed in the past six months -- this is the time to
send me a correction!

The information I would like for each entry is:

SCA & Mundane Names
SCA & Mundane Location (ie, City & State, Kingdom & Shire)
Titles & Offices, if any
Interests
Net address

The only fields required for entry are one name and Net address; all others
are optional, although strongly encouraged. Don't give me your full street
address for the Mundane Location field; I just want people to have some idea
of where you're from. 

Please restrict each field to one line; if your titles would take more than 
that after abbreviation, list the titles that you especially want people
to see first, as I will truncate lines if they are too long. Ditto for
Interests. If you use abbreviations, please send me the spelled out version
as well; I don't know all of the abbreviations used in the Known World.

Net addresses in Internet format (name@machine.site.domain) are strongly
preferred. If you must use bang-addresses (...x!y!machine!name), then
send me the *best* path to you. Again, there is only room for one line
of information, so don't send me an entire map of how to get to you.

Please restrict the use of "care of" entries to cases where it is *really*
important. I'm not averse to putting in, say, an entry for your group's
seneschal under your net address if you think that they are likely to
be contacted by people from the net, *but* people are really beginning
to abuse this feature, and if this abuse gets any worse, I'm going to
have to make a "one entry per net address" rule to keep the size 
manageable.

The deadline for sending me entries is sometime in February, so get them
to me ASAP. The new edition will probably go out over the SCAnet sometime
in late February.

Greetings! 

   I came to the "Knowne World" thru unusual ( mmmm, maybe not so
unusual? :-) means.  
   I had started playing AD&D a long time ago (Vulcans forge! longer
than I care to remember...) and I made a new friend thru this 
that had recently moved here from Midrealm. (Wey-Teague Trevor (sp?) 
My interest in fencing and D&D led him to believe that I would be
perfect for SCA, and he proceded to tempt me into going to an event
locally.  "Ok - some day..." was the usual response.  
   Then, one day, we were driving by an Event.  (Last Years' 
Kriegstrieber in Dragons' Mist)  It was like coming home.  Were could
I get my costume?  How would I make my tent? Were could I get..? How
could I...?  I want to... There was no doubt. Hooked the first two minutes
walking onto the grounds.  
   I got my personna thru just choosing a name.  There is a lot of 
work to be done on it, yet.  But, I'm getting there.  (especially
reading the fine research that has gone on here... I've got a LOT of
work to do :-) I guess I'm still (what was that "simply awful term?" :-)
a newby... :-) 

                     My finest regards,

                          Cyrus Hammerhand

	Friends and I occationally start toasting things at the 
cantina we (they still do, as it is now 700 miles away I don't
get to very often) freaquent.  The first toast is always "To the
Queen!"  in fond and loving memory.  

	In other things, I just looked at a wonderfull book.  To wit:

Japan: The Shaping of Daimyo Culture, 1185-1868
Edited: Yoshiaki Shimizu
National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.
Copyright 1988
ISBN 0-8076-1214-6 (Hardcover) 
ISBN 0-8946-8122-2 (Softcover)

I understand that the price was about $30 for the soft, I don't know
about the hard.  This is a *nice* book.  Lots of pictures of things
currently on exhibit at the National Gallery (till Jan 23), along
with commentary on the culture and background of the piece, including
one (short, or so it seemed to me) section on armour through the period,
an a fabulous section on paintings, another on caligraphy, the tea
cerimony and others.  I wish I could get down there to see the show,
anyone between here (Princeton) and there want to go?  This would be worth
missing 12th Night for!  But anyway (before I get carried away...)

One interesting find in the book was the following entry on a painting
called "Dragon and Clouds":

"Typically in East Asia, the dragon was paired with the tiger 
[sound familar?] as cosmological symbols of East and West, water 
and metal, respectively.

On a pair of paintings in Daitokuji by the Sang [Song?  sorry, poor
notes] painter Muqi is the inscription, "When the dragon rises, 
clouds appear" and "When the tiger roars, wind blasts." "

No wonder it always rains at Pennsic!  (And did you notice that 
we have the Dragon and the Tiger reversed?  Oh well.)  :-)


Last, one idea that I recently had that you autocrats could use.
Edit one line in your .sigs to say something like:
"Ask me about Generic Event, Mon/day.  Placename, kingdon."

This would give you a way to let people hear about your event
and not overload Danulf's machine.  And people who didn't care
wouldn't be forced to see the net pay for sending a posting out
to everyone.

Greetings.

This is by way of an introduction and explanation, rather than a posting
for alt.sca.

The company I work for does not propogate alt. groups internaly, but 
because of favors done our uucp administrator has kindly set things
up so that I get the postings as mail.  Therefore, any postings I
might be moved to make will have to be through some outide agent--to
wit: you. (Inasmcuh as others have assured me that you would be willing
to do so as part of your activities in compiling the digest version of
the group.)

If this is a problem--please let me know and I will try to make other
arrangements.

Assuming this is all okay, I will probably comtribute to the growing
collection of how people came to the SCA in the near future.  In that
vein, I will try to get my Lady (Dorothea of Caer-Myrddin) to write
a suitable piece also.

For reference, I am (in the Society): Hal Ravn.

Regards,  Hal
