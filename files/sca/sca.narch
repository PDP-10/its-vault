Recently, someone (sorry, I didn't catch the name) made the claim:

The board may have considered it, but I don't think the legal facts are clear
cut. Consider the both Civil War and Revolutionary War groups sometimes keep
women out of "combat" roles on an historical basis. I am pretty sure the Civil
War people have been challenged and won in court (this last is hearsay from a
Civil War group friend of mine). These groups tend to be non-profit,
educational, tax-exempt organizations, just like the SCA. They have even more
support from the government in that they often get free use of state/federal
parks.

David Friedman related to me some months ago a conversation he had with a 
federal (?) judge. The judge claimed, off the top of his head, he thought there
wouldn't be any problem banning women from fighting for historical reasons, if
those reasons were actually valid. I don't know what degree of accuracy the
judge thought this offhand opinion to be. David?

I havent seen this sample, but I can imagine two other ways that this could
happen:
1 A "Non-fighting" dent, as from helmet being dropped down a staircase 
or somesuch.

2 Or a blow from behind.

Im not saying that I dont believe in wrap blows; the last time I got headache 
fighting I got wrapped while kneeling. What i AM saying is that it will be 
very hard to prove.

Subject: SCA security forces

Unto the Rialto greetings.

I have been on several sides of the security fence, police, armed security,
unarmed security, uniformed, plain-clothes, military, and while no expert, I
have two points to offer.

1)  The gentle from the West who commented on getting to know the police forces
of the area hit it right on the head.  Now I'm not saying that *every* event
needs to do this, but every War must, and every camping event should.  I don't
go to many of either, but I will say that in *all* instances where there have
been police on-site as a site requirement, I have sought out that officer and
explained who we were, what we did, what were the likely possibilities, what
help, trained or untrained, he or she was likely to get in a difficulty, etc.
DO IT.  Do we know yet, after how many years, the various police personnel
hanging around Cooper's Lake.  We should.

2)  This may sound silly, but the best description I've ever seen of the
problems of not doing this right is in Mary Pulver's 'Murder At The War' (By
the way, I'm looking for a copy, anybody know where to get one?)  The two
extremes of the detective/hero/SCA member who eventually solves the mystery,
and the Trooper who has the run-in with the King are prime examples of the
difference between the authorities knowing who we are and what we do, and the
authorities having to make snap judgements based on immediate visual
inforamtion.  I'll tell you one thing.  If I were an officer who knew nothing
about the SCA, and I were approached by, say, Duke Vissevald in chain mail and
sword, I'd have a firearm pointed at him immediately.  And you know something.
I think he'd understand.

Subject: Introduction, replies

Greetings.  As of Middle Crown (May 28) I will be shouldering the
responsibilities of Seneschal for the Middle Kingdom for a while, at
the pleasure of Their Majesties and in the service of the People.

If you have any suggestions, comments, complaints, etc. I can be reached
electronically (ROYG@PURCCVM), but please exercise discretion, discriminating
between messages appropriate for e-mail direct and those for this forum.

Some quick comments.  Awilda mentioned that the SCA is as a minority
culture.  This is dangerous.  It is far better for the health of the
Society if *all* members have healthy, active social lives outside
of the Society.  I am also uncomfortable with comparisons with ethnic
/religious groups.

As to concerns with ceremonies of various peerages, perhaps we ought
to encourage all peers and peers-to-be to focus on *becoming* peers-
in-fact more than on peers-in-record.  Thus the ceremony reflects
what people already recognize, and is a time of recognition, rather
than of elevation?  It is a long road, but moving toward respect for
persons *more than* respect for positions seems healthy. Where does
this start?

On archery, and the perceptions of the people and the "wimp factor".
At the Coronation of Comar and Lisa in the Middle, His Majesty
announced that He was commanding the Knights of His realm to present
themselves and their squires to shoot the bow if they are present at
Pennsic.  There are also an increasing number of events with no
tournament, except of archery.  Perhaps perceptions are changing?

Thank you for your patience.

Gareth

Subject: Pennsic camp requirements

Greetings from Ellisif!

While people are talking about fire safety, I thought I'd mention some of
this year's camp requirements for Pennsic, so that people who don't get 
kingdom newsletters will know and be able to start preparing.  (These are 
summarized from my memory of the information sent to the June newsletters; 
I don't have a copy on hand.)

1. There must be 3.5 feet between tents.  This is wall to wall, not
rope to rope, as I understand it.  (This is not specified; I asked for a 
clarification.)

2. There must be a fire extinguisher within line of sight of all fires.
(I don't know about tiki torches.)

3. When you register your camp (August 4 and 5, by the way), you will have
to submit a scale drawing of your camp.  (Actually, I think you have to
submit three copies, one of which you'll have to post at your camp.)  
Locations and types of fire extinguishers will have to be marked.  If the 
layout doesn't meet with the approval of whoever's running these things, 
you'll have to revise it until it does.

The information says that security will be enforcing these layout
requirements.  (It also refers to the "Look at all that empty land; move
those tents or we'll kill you" committee, but I think this is a different 
entity.)

The term "His/Her Royal Majesty" is likely used in the SCA because it
parallels the term "His/Her Royal Highness" (used to distinguish the
Heirs to the Throne from Their Serene Highnesses, the rulers of a 
Principality).

Hmm....if "Royal" is superfluous because you're already saying "Your
Majesty", and if you don't want to say "Majesty" either...

Subject: Safety at Pennsic

There actually have been assaults and rapes at Pennsic.  This sort of
information tends to be kept quiet, but we do ourselves a disservice if we
pretend it doesn't happen. 

Pennsic is a big place.  There are well over 5000 people attending, and
these are not always the same people you find attending other events -
aside from SCA members, there are people who belong to other medieval
groups, fringe groups, or no group in particular.  Any time this many
people are gathered in one place, there are (statistically) bound to be
a few bad apples.  

One such incident occurred several Pennsics back.  A child who was deemed old
enough to travel about on her own (she was 12, but looked much older) was
coerced into a tent by some man.  He set two friends on guard outside the tent
to make sure he wasn't disturbed, and threatened the girl when she tried to
leave.  The girl told her parents about this a little while later, it was
looked into by people in authority at the campsite, and the men in question 
were turned over to the legal authorities, and eventually prosecuted (and
convicted, I believe) for the rape.

While I don't have all the details, I do know for a fact that this occurred.

I have no moral for this story.  Never let minors travel alone?  Warn your
children that they shouldn't follow strange men home?  I just wanted to
let the members of the Rialto know that we have gone beyond "what if's",
and might want to be talking about "how not to's".

Greetings unto the gentles of the Rialto,
  Ioseph asked about female worthies in history.  I know of two.  The first
being Joan of Arc.  Another is Boadicea who was Queen of the Iceni a tribe from
   East Anglia.  Around the year 60 C.E. she led a rebellion against the Romans.
She was nearly sucessful in kicking the Romans out of Britian, but in the end
the Romans crushed the uprising.
  Now for a change of topics does anyone know Cornish.  I have a Cornish persona
   and I am looking for a last name.  I was thinking of using"daughter of..." I
found (in a Cornish dictionary) the word "mrygh" for daughter.  I'm not sure in
   which context it is used.  That is, did the Cornish say "daughter of..." or d
   id they say "so and sosdaughter" like the Norse do?

Subject: "Peers/dependants"

Greetings!

Being in a soapbox kind of mood, I am going to quibble with Master Robyyan's 
use of the phrase "Peer/dependant" in dig. #694.  This is not because I 
disagree with anything in Robyyan's posting; quite the contrary-- it was 
excellent.  It is the use of the word "dependant" I take exception to, because 
of the connotations the word can call up.

Let me explain:  to me as a Companion of the Pelican, the taking of a protegee 
means the forming of a relationship which, although _ostensibly_ "teacher/
student", is a *reciprocal* one.  I expect to learn from my protegees as well 
as teach them.  I respect them as individuals, and their opinions.  I often 
seek their input, as well as working with them.  To me, this is as it should 
be.  Which is why I much prefer the phrasing "Peer/associate," which is what 
we use down here.  To me, the connotation of "association" is preferable to 
that of "dependancy"

On the other hand, there are Peers who engage in what we refer to in Trimaris 
as "scalp collecting".  These are people who often (but not always) have
veritable stables of associates, most or all of whom are treated as gofers.  
They are expected to fetch and carry, and to wait upon their Peer.  Their 
total number, and possibly who some specifically are, are viewed by the Peer
as indications of prestige and standing within the Peer's Circle.   

The use of the word "dependant" called the latter type of Peer to my mind, for 
such Peers see their associates as just that:  dependant upon them-- and 
that's just how they like it.  I don't think that does any justice to the
associate. 

That I am bringing this up is not meant to re-open the discussion(s) on "What 
is an Associate" or "Should We Have Associates?"  Rather, it is meant to 
foster some degree of awareness.  I consider this to be complemantary to what 
Master Robbyan said about Peer/associate relationships.

Because in addition to the excellent questions he has already posed, these can
now be added:  what kind of associate do you wish to be?  How do you wish to
be treated by your Peer?  What kind of attitude do you want to see in your
Peer with respect to his/her associates?  What kind of Peer do *you* want to
be "when you grow up"?  Do you want to be the same kind of Peer as the one you
are associated with?  If not, why not?  How do you want to comport yourself 
when you are a Peer?

Hoping I have accomplished something, I shall now step down from my soapbox.  
I thank Master Robyyan in advance for letting me pick on him.

The Constabularly in the West serves to act--as do the Seneschals--at the
interface between the SCA and the world we are imbedded in.  In practice,
the police seem to *like* to have some one person they can talk to with
afoot in each world view when their services are needed.  The Constables
*aren't* a private police force--they are a group designed to minimize the
need for police to have to be at our events and to call the police in
when needed.

The Constabulary is almost never seen within an event (it's a major reason
why their work goes largely unrecognized).  The lone exception is that
a few announcements--like parking, fire restrictions, lost and found--will
be announced by or on behalf of the Constabulary.  The Constables like to 
keep a low profile.  Indeed--one of the specifics used here is that people
on gate duty shouldn't carry any steel that isn't "street legal".

Im afraid I disagree rather strongly here. In my experience, people have 
talents for different weapon forms. This supersedes any general conclusions
one may have. I like to let new fighters try different forms out to see
which they feel most at home with and have the most fun. I personally am
very right-handed and really awful with two swords, whereas W&S and
polearm work adequately.

Good idea. We should do that, to.

Then again, maybe this wasn't the one I visited, which was out at the

griddle over the indoor hearth.

Last summer I also visited the Culross "palace", a 3-story (I think)
manor built by a wealthy businessman between 1590 and 1640.  I wasn't
allowed to get any interior pictures, and both my exterior pictures
and diary are at home, but I remember some interesting features.

By amazing coincedence, there was a good rainstorm going when I
visited the "palace", and so I particularly noticed the plumbing.
The dirt floors of the ground floor were well-trenched at the edges,
and runoff from the roof was guided through a series of pipes into a
basin in the kitchen.  There were no puddles inside.
I remember the kitchen being very interesting, but I'd need to look in
my diary to remember WHAT was so interesting.

I believe this is none other the the famous "Culross girdle" (or
"griddle" in standard English) I mentioned seeing on the black
house's hearth.  It's called a Culross girdle because King James
the (nth and n-5th) gave the town of Culross a monopoly on the
making of iron girdles in Scotland.  What's cooking on it is most
likely a round Scottish shortbread.

Yes, glossy paper is really nasty (not impossible, but very difficult)
to recycle.  Printing ON recycled paper would be nice, too.  While
we're at it, I wonder how difficult it would be to put TI and some of
the Kingdom/local newsletters on recycled paper; the market has built
up enough that it's no longer significantly more expensive than
virgin-fiber paper (it would be cheaper, but there are governmental
subsidies for chopping down trees).

At the past few Calafian events we've been making some effort to
collect and recycle the truly vast numbers of bottles and aluminum
cans produced at a typical tourney, proceeds going to the Baronial
coffers.

After all, "it's not PERIOD to throw away things that are still usable!"

In Rubens' "A History of Jewish Costume" is a picture of a Jew in

There's a fellow who frequents the local Renfaires peddling insults
who wears an enormous codpiece sculpture of a jester's head, thumbing
its nose.  On the more subtle side, my friend Etienne in Storvik tells
me that when he describes his peacock-feathered codpiece, non-SCA people
(who know what a codpiece is) groan at the pun, but SCA people don't
even notice at and merely say "Oh, that sounds pretty."

I don't know of any companies around here that do recreations of artifacts,

find the names of people, probably in the u.s. who you could write to.
What the Sca is... This is still in doubt.  Generally we are a non-profit 
group which studies the middle ages and renaissance through practical 
experience.  There is no better way to test armor than use, or dance than 
tripping over a skirt...  As for particulars the group in mississauga 
meets on monday nights and the group in toronto on wednesday. At the 
meetings we talk about history, how to build things, and generally 
anything else.  The fun part is that groups host saturday events.  At an 
event you dress up in some attempt at medieval costume and try to behave 
medievaly.  Most events will have a tourney, games, quests, a feast, court 
depending on what royalty is there and dancing...
The code of ethics for knights...Depending on what you want, the rules for 
cavaliers as nasty horse fighters or as the ideal group of men frighting

guidelines and I think it includes as well as not fighting on holy days 
(1/3 of year) not killing innocent bystanders, monks, ladies, and 
children.... There are also books about knights... or post a note on the

I agree with Harabanar in that using the same progression of weapons for 
newcomer training isn't a good idea.  As he states, some fighters are just
naturally good with one or another weapon and not-so-good with others.  IMHO
the "ideal" way to train someone is:

a)  Try to line them up with the weapon they feel most comfortable with and
    let them start training with that.  Since they will often pick up the
    basic use of such a weapon their confidence will increase more
    quickly than if using something that feels awkward.  Also since they will
    more naturally move the "favorite" weapon more attention can be paid to  
    style, balance, body/footwork, "combat reflexes" etc.

b)  Once they have become familiar with combat styles and other aspects of
    general fighting they can then move on to "advanced" training, other forms
    & weapons (I differentiate between the two) with more comfort since they
    now have the basics more or less mastered.

The point is that training has to be tailored to the individual in most, if not
all, cases.  Some newcomers start throwing perfect snaps on the first day, and
some never will (and they'll end up with polearm or greatsword).  I've trained
people who COULD NOT WALK WITH BALANCE no matter how hard they tried (the old
reliable balance-the-book-on-the-head method does help now and then...) and
worked with others who could stand blindfolded on one foot for 2-3 minutes with
no problem.  I know of some Knights who will never use one form or another
because they are so uncomfortable with them that they know they're not safe 
(makes you wonder about the rule that says "Knights are automatically 
authorized in all weapons forms...").

WHOA!  I strongly doubt that either Awilda or myself wants a private
police force.  What I DO want, though is people who are trained to deal
with certain situations, and who are acknowledged as knowledgeable in that
area.

Secondarily, there are many "private police forces" in existence.  Ever

Tertiary, we already have what amounts to a private police "force".  Ever

I am sure that many - nay most of us - nay the largest percentage less than
100 - are quite responsible.  However, there are always times that something
occurs.  Sometimes a mundane commits a less-than-considerate-act, such as
some of the sotries that I'vew seen go by on the net.  Sometimes, someone
is drunk, and a little bellicose, and a little armed.  In many of these
situations, people start feeling very defensive.  If all that is needed is
force, then that we have plenty of.  IF, however, what is needed, is
tact, diplomacy, and other such skills, sometimes we are lacking in a mob
stampede to help out.  Mobs usually lack tact for one reason or the other.
In such instances, it is important that someone take charge to keep a cap
on things.  If there is someone there who has a badge, such as a warranted
constable, people generally defer to that individual, who can then best
try and defuse the entire scenario.

It is these sorts of individuals that we ought to seek out/train and mark
so that others know of them and will (generally) defer to them.  The name
doesn't matter.  Call them constables, call them diplomats, call them when
such situations arise.  The last is the most essential thing to call them.

Subject: Re: HRM Phone Home, wraparound

Portable pay phones could help reduce the lines for outgoing calls, but
beyond that it's not much different from the current situation.  Part of
the problem is that there is more than one problem, to wit:

 - Communication within Cooper's Lake: this includes things like "has anyone
   seen His Majesty?  We're ready to start the Woods Battle..." and other
   problem having to do mainly with locating people or resources (including
   things like medical evacuation, firefighting, security, etc.).  I doubt
   that phones of any sort would be any more useful than the current scheme
   of people-in-straw-hats-on-golf-carts-with-walkie-talkies.  Heralds'
   Point is also a useful resource for less time-critical messages.  It
   might be useful to have a phone at Chiurgeons' Point (if there isn't
   already), but even that wouldn't be much faster than radioing to
   someone to call an ambulance.

 - Communication between Cooper's Lake and The Rest of the World:  This is
   where I could see the usefulness of a cellular phone.  It would provide
   a way for parents & latecomers, for example, to get in touch with a
   particular campsite, even if the person they want to talk to isn't
   there.

This weekend I verified experimentally that Cooper's Lake does indeed have
celluar coverage (having driven past it on the way to a wedding), albeit
weak.  It seems to be on the edge of either the Erie or Pittsburgh systems.

I'm unenthused about the idea of being called or paged at the war, but I
must admit it would sometimes be nice to be able to tell someone "well,
if you call this number in the evening you'll at least be able to leave
a message even if I'm not around," which is impractical with the pay phone
approach.

Why not just talk to the local phone company?  I know the local company here
has portable pay phones for just such occasions.  They are mounted on a
trailer, can be transported to  large outdoor events and set up very quickly.
In addition, they have a sign on top advertising the phone company.

The magnitude of Pensic as well as the fact that we are a registered
non-profit organization (donations to the SCA can provide tax advantages)
might get their attention.

The phone company may be willing put in temporary pay phones with advertising
in exchange for providing additional incomming emergency lines.  Tax deductable
advertising to 6000 'captive' pay phone customers should be worth something.

    While incidents of this sort, however alarming, are as scarce as
    they appear to be, I would rather live with the risks of amateur
    response than change the nature of the society to the extent that
    such a move would entail."

In fact, as far as i can tell, the alarm that these incidents and rumers of 
these incidents cause harms more people (although less accutely) than the 
incidents themselves.  I do *not* like having my freedom restricted by well 
meaning people who dont want me to get hurt, and i don't like staring 
mistrustfully at random gentles i pass in the dark, while staying poised for 
fight or flight.

What is needed, clearly is a watch:  a group of several gentles who roam a 
given section of the camp being visible so that peoples fears will be allayed, 
and offering what help is in their power to those who need it--sending drunks 
in the direction of their camp, offering light to gentles traversing 
particularly dark and treacherous streaches of road, and sceaming for help at 
the top of their lungs the minute they encounter something over their heads.  
I see no reason that they should be specially trained in first aid, or self 
defence, or indeed, any thing other than the layout of the camp.  

I do not think this will apreciably change the character of the SCA.  Some 
groups already have guards at their camp gate all night, many camping events 
have people at the camp gate all night, and everyone is used to people walking 
regular beats in the day time and bellowing at intervals.  THe watch was a 
part of town and city life in the middle ages & rennaissance, and while in 
some places it was a professional organizations, in others it was the duty/ 
privalage of the citizens.  An organized watch could also add to the period 
atmosphere if we can keep them from constantly muttering into walkie-talkies.

if course, this entails yet another organizational hassle for somebody, but i 
doubt that the sca has yet exausted either its supply of volunteers for 
nessessary work or of organizers.  (in fact, we seem to have a plethora of the 
latter, and offering them something that needs to be organized might just keep 
them from organizing something that doesnt).

Awilda says something to the effect that "men are going to dominate

fighters].

Um... while the socialization *is* there, it can be overcome.

And, well - some time ago, I wanted to read a scroll I'd done in

the court herald to decipher it.  So I asked the herald, and he
said 'I dunno - let's ask the autocrat'.  Artair came back after
awhile and said 'Autocrat says ask the King'.  So Artair asked
Tadashi.  Tadashi said 'If it's ok with Ariake, it's Ok with me.'
me.'

That was close to an explanation of the power structure for the
reign; I'll admit Ariake fights, but I don't think the Queens
don't have just as much affect as the Kings.

(And it was Ok with Ariake, for which I am thankful.)

This is a different view on why there are so few women fighters.

They get little training, and even less encouragement.  A friend of mine
is trying to pick up fighting.  She asks people to teach her, and they
say yes.  But when it comes to the actual teaching, they are no where to
be found.  I don't think that this is the rule, but it's around enough
that many women will be discouraged from even trying, and the women that
do try will quit early on because they can't advance because no one's
willing to teach them what to do.

"Suggestion: Take one old 16-gauge SCA helm and put a melon inside.
Nail the helm to a sturdy log set in the ground. Then attack it with
a steel sword, using wraparound blows. Check the sword for melon
juice, and post the result to the Rialto. End of speculations."
(William de Corbie)

It would be a worthwhile experiment, but it would not settle the
question. There are at least three important problems:

1. Your helm may be stronger or weaker than the corresponding period
helm. This is a matter not merely of thickness but also hardness and
toughness--iron and steel are very far from homogeneous.

2. The sword may be harder or softer, sharper or blunter, than the
real one would have been.

3. A melon does not come with its own armor; a brain does. A blow
might cut through a melon but be stopped by the skull, which is quite
a substantial barrier. You then have the question of whether the
shock would knock someone out or not.

I was impressed by the importance of points 1 and 2 many years ago
(Pennsic 2, I think). A swordmaker, in order to demonstrate the
importance of hardness, took a piece of one of his early swords and
arranged it edge up on the ground, held by wooden pegs. He then
struck it several times, edge to edge, with one of his current
swords. The old blade was notched, the new one unmarked.

Your experiment would be better, although still not entirely
satisfactory, as a way of testing the relative strength of different
blows.

Households and New Members

Cher, in answering Justin's posting, writes "my Barony gets,
proportionately, about the same rate of influx Justin cites for
Carolingia. " I think she is missing the point that Justin is (or
should be) making. Ten new members in a group of fifty do not present
the same problem as a hundred in a group of five hundred, so getting
"proportionally" the same rate is not the issue.

Generally speaking, organizational arrangements do not scale. The
institutions that work well for a group of ten may work badly for a
group of a hundred, and similarly on up. In a small group, each
person's actions have a substantial effect on the group and each
individual is visible to the others. This facilitates the sort of
informal organizational arrangements that I like. In a group of five
hundred, those arrangements, unfortunately, do not work so well, so
you end up with rules, reports, bureaucracy.

One solution, and the one implicit in Arastorm's posting, is to let
specific jobs, such as the job of making a new person feel welcome
and teaching him what he will need to know, be done by groups small
enough to do it--households. The household has an incentive to be
welcoming and helpful because in that way it acquires attractive new
members, benefitting the existing members. This is, in fact, a feudal
solution to the problem of large scale organization. As the postings
in this thread indicates, sometimes it works well, sometimes badly,
largely depending on the degree to which the households are loyal
parts of the group.

"The legal facts are that barring females from participating in the
martial acts activities of the Society (a non-profit, tax-exempt
organization, which is relevant to their legal status) would have
been a violation of mundane civil rights laws.  Had their been solid
documentation that females never touched a weapon under any
circumstances, it wouldn't have mattered diddly. Mundane law takes
precedence, and the Board would have been faced with a choice of
permitting female combatants (or being forced to do so by a mundane
court) or flushing the SCA's non-profit status.  That this was the
legal situation was acknowledged by the Board of that time."  (Cher)

Cher is making two different assertions. The first is a statement
about mundane law, which I believe to be wrong. The second is a
statement about what the board thought mundane law was; I do not know
whether it is right or wrong.

At the time of the controversy I asked my sister, a lawyer who had
been involved in gender-discrimination matters (I believe she
integrated a prominent private club in San Francisco), for her
opinion, and it was that the SCA was clearly within its legal rights.
If people are interested, I can inquire further; since I am mundanely
employed by the University of Chicago Law School, I have access to
lots of legal experts. As I understand it, the general rule is that
one is permitted to discriminate as long as gender is, in the court's
opinion, relevant to what you are discriminating with regard to. Not
permitting women to play roles in a historical reenactment group that
were historically played by men would, I believe, fall well within
that.

My own guess--and it is only a guess--is that in this situation (and
others) legal arguments get used by people who want to make other
people do something, whether or not they are correct. It is always
easier to say "perhaps you are right, but we have to do it my way or
we will get sued" than to say "I insist on doing it my way." 

We saw some of this a year or so ago on the Rialto, when the question
arose of why minors could not come to Pennsic without their own
parents (or legal guardians very strictly defined). Anyone who wants
to go through that old thread will see how rapidly strong legal
assertions turn soft when confronted by contrary facts--in that case,
the fact that private summer camps routinely did what we were told it
was legally impossible for the Coopers to do.

Anyway, I would like to see the evidence on which Cher bases her
assertions, both about the law and about the board.

This is one bit of Eastern slang that it's probably important for new
Pennsic-goers to learn.  I have a good friend who, even at her fourth
Pennsic, didn't know much more about tranya than the fact that it was
something the "War Puppies" (a fun group from Ostgardr, mundanely New York
City) serve at parties at the War.  It turned out that if she'd known
what it was she would have been spared the experience of finding out
the hard way.  On the other hand, if treated with respect, I've found
it can be fun stuff.  So, without further ado:

TRANYA:  A drink whose main ingredients are grain alcohol and lime
koolaid mix (sweetened.)  Served, ideally, in a translucent plastic jug 
with handles, garnished with a green lightstick floating inside.  The War
Puppies serve it at parties, and Duke Gavin Kilkenny isn't supposed to
drink it.  Seriously.  Pronounced, "TRAHN-yuh".  It hath a kick like
unto the proverbial Army mule; you better believe it!!  Use with respect.

I wrote up a set of instructions for Jouyssance a few months ago, but
never did anything with them because although the dance is very easy
to learn from a teacher, it's hard to pick up from instructions alone.
(Also, the  writeup was too long -- I judged -- for the intended
publication.)

I'm not sure how useful these instructions will be.  If you should
see me (or Debatable Lands dancers) at an event or at the War, just
ask.  As I said, it's a lot easier to teach than to figure out.
Well, here goes.  I've taken out most of the editing info, although I've
left in the "superscript" notation to identify footnotes.


	Instructions for Jouyssance vous donneray



Jouyssance is a basse dance which is done fairly often in the Barony Marche of 
the Debatable Lands (BMDL).  It is a relatively easy dance to teach, and has a 
rather extravagant feel to it.  The space requirements are outrageous.


The instructions given here are those to which the dance is commonly done in 
the SCA.  They are considerably different from those given by Arbeau.  The 
explanation for this is that Arbeau was wrong.  As he plainly admits, basse 
dances were popular in his youth -- and he was no longer young.  The 
instructions he gives are not completely consistent with what we know about 
basse dances, are somewhat inconsistent with the music (moving too slowly when 
the music says not to) and aren't much fun.  Think of Arbeau's instructions as 
the skeleton on which the flesh of this dance is hung.


The instructions for this dance are presented below, in three parts.  First, 
the original Arbeau instructions are given.  Below that, the instruction s are 
repeated in what I hope is a more usable format.  Those instructions should be 
all that is needed for anyone who has ever done the dance.  Finally, extensive 
footnotes on the reconstruction are provided for those unfamiliar with the 
dance, or for anyone wishing more information about the decisions which were 
made in reconstructing it.


I.  Original Instructions:


The following material is taken from the Dover edition of Thoinot Arbeau's 
1588 "Orchesography":


<Music and modified tablature -- paste here or get someone with better 
handwriting to redo>
<Sorry, I'm not posting my scotch tape to the net :-) >

Reverence


Footnotes:

1.  I have been told that this reconstruction originated from Ingrid Brainard, 
but have not been able to verify this.  I learned it from the dance master who 
learned it from the dance mistress who...

2.  The two couples should start about a hundred feet apart (give or take a 
bit; you'll find the optimum distance quickly enough by trial and error.)  I 
am not joking.  I don't know about your dance practices but ours are held in a 
room that's closer to thirty feet long.  There are four ways to cheat, so as 
to make this work.  a) Take very small steps.  You may have to do this at 
times, but it detracts from the dance.  b) On some of the steps, double 
backwards instead of forward.  Use this with caution, as it changes the nature 
of the dance.  c)  Cheat on the bransles.  Instead of bransling apart and back 
together, bransle apart and move back together in a V so that you wind up five 
to ten feet back of where you just were.  d)  Cheat on the turns.  When you 
are taking the half turns during the reprise, it is fairly easy to add a 
backward drift to your motion.  Occasionally you will find yourselves in a big 
enough ballroom or hall:  Take advantage!

3.  The instructions are numbered by the measures of the music.  (So, for 
example, a double takes four measures.  In fact, virtually everything in this 
dance takes four measures of music.)  This means that each measure corresponds 
to a single step.  Note that this means that the music will be going quite 
briskly (about sixty measures per minute) while the dancers will be moving at 
a moderate speed.  It is the custom in the West to do this dance at half speed 
-- taking two full measures for every step.  I recommend against this as it is 
not nearly as much fun.  Besides, it contradicts Arbeau, and we can't have 
that.

4.  Get someone to demonstrate a French style reverence.  Basically, the lady 
does a slight knee bend -- the knees angling slightly out from each other -- 
with her full dress guarding her from embarassment.  The man inclines himself 
towards the lady in the process of placing his right foot diagonally backward 
behind his left foot.  If the man has a hat, he should sweep it off in the 
process, and return it to his head as he rights himself.

5.  Don't wave.

6.  Collectively, this set of steps is the standard pavane step.  This is a 
French dance, so all steps should be simple walking steps in a straight line. 
 This is not an Italian dance.  Do not zig-zag or figure skate or undulate up 
and down.

7.  Face your partner and cross right forearms.  Styling is everything here. 
 Try to get someone familiar with the style of the period to show this to you. 
 Here is an attempt to explain:  Facing your partner from a distance of a 
couple of feet, take a single step forward with your right foot, angling 
slightly to your left, so that you are angle about thirty degrees towards your 
partner.  While doing this, turn your head over your right shoulder so that 
you are looking at each other, and cross right forearms, firmly, in an X. 
 Since your partner has also taken a step, and is also angled at about thirty 
degrees from the original orientation, your two shoulders, the crossed arms, 
and your partner's two shoulders should all be along a single line, and you 
should be looking at your partner over your right shoulder.  All that took as 
much time as a single walking step -- measure.  Now step back into your 
original position, still facing your partner.  That was a reprise right.  It's 
often pronounced 'reprisa'.  (This description is at variance from that of 
Arbeau, who describes the reprise as a sort of wiggling of the knees.)

8.  This is just like a right reprise, except that you use your left foot and 
your left arm.

9.  Touch right palms (you're allowed to in this dance) and switch places, 
turning towards your left.

10.  Step away from each other the man to his right, the lady to her left) 
while holding inside hands, then step back together.  Pay no attention to 
Arbeau's instructions here for how a bransle should be done.  Note that you 
are now improper (lady on the left) since you only took a single half-turn.

11.  In this step, the man does an ordinary double.  The lady waits two 
measures, until he is half way through the double, and then does a 
double-speed double to catch up.  Let go of your partner's hand for the 
duration of this step.

12.  At the end of the second set of reprises you should be proper again.

13.  Just as you have to make a quarter turn to face your partner before the 
right reprise, so must you make another quarter turn to face your opposite 
before the left reprise.

14.  Form a circle by touching palms.  Six singles to the left should take you 
about three quarters of the way around the circle.

15.  Stay with the music.  You have as much time to perform this as it takes 
to clap twice, slowly, and no more.  First the ladies go through the circle, 
trading places.  The men should move a step backwards, simultaneously, to let 
them through.  The ladies are now facing the direction from which they came. 
 Then the men should go through the circle, trading places.  The men are still 
facing their original direction, but they are now standing, proper, with their 
opposites.  They have just traded partners.  (I could be wrong, but I consider 
it improbable that this figure belonged in the original dance.  But leave 
it in.)

16.  Repeat all the steps you took getting from your end of the room to the 
middle to get back from the middle of the room to the end, except that you 
replace the final double with a conversion double, so as to turn around and 
face the other couple.  To do a conversion, the couple turns together -- the 
lady turning forward and the man turning backward -- till they have switch 
places and are facing the direction from which they came.

In metal, "guage" is the number of sheets, that when stacked, are 1-inch

First--there is an Inter-Kingdom newsletter for Kingdom Constables already
in existence.  I don't know who runs it--but I can find out.  (I.e. I'll
ask our Kingdom Constable next time I see him.)  Second--as you can see from
the above, the West has an organized Constabulary.  The most obvious thing
the Constabulary does is run Gate.  Other duties are exercised as needed.
How much perimeter patrolling is done depends on the site.  Our current
Kingdom Constable approaches "problems" with the attitude that there is
no problem.  He wants to do his best to see that everybody else realizes
that, too.  He does an excellent job.  His predecessor comments on the
Rialto, and may have a lot to say on these subjects.

One further note on all this--Kingdom Constable is a Great Office of State.
The Constable *must* have the authority to get the job done.

Hartshorn is ammonium carbonate.  It a heat-driven leavening agent (like

Subject: historical female knights

In re the queation from Domnell MacDaniell concerning the
possibility of women who were knighted, the answer would be 
yes with qualifications, based on certain period evidence.  
The full list of the Assizes of Jerusalem (c.1170) give the 
names of everyone who owed knightly service to the Kingdom  
of Jerusalem, a total of 749 knights.  37 of these, (about 
5%) were female.  This does not enclude the royal familia 
(about 100 knights) or any of the Orders Militant, or the 
knights' service for the County of Tripoli or the Principality
of Antioch. Period Moslem accounts (c. 1190) describe several
knights being taken prisoner who turned out to be women, and
several others found dead, their sex discovered when their 
armor was stripped off for booty.
One should also keep in mind the actual ceremonial dubbing of 
a knight was not widespread until the mid 13th century - if
you could afford a horse, arms and weapons and possessed the 
skill and/or training to use them, you were concidered a 
knight by your peers.

Subject: safety at Pennsic

Greetings to all from Megan. 
I wish that I could honestly say that Pennsic is a safe place 
to be...it used to be, back in the days when it was much smaller, 
and you knew practically everybody, and you could be fairly sure of
even the few who were strangers. The war is much bigger now, and times
are different. Gone are the days when the worst danger was the mud,
(yes, I was the teeny-bopper who got stuck in the mud at Pennsic Four
the Flood) Having sat many an hour of midnight troll duty at the war,
I can attest to the fact that a good number of people come in who are
not part of any SCA group, and are there only for the partying. They
are no fighters in their groups, they are not aligned with any
household, shire, barony or even kingdom. They are not merchants,
heralds, chirurgeons, or participants in any other official pennsic
activity. In recent years I have taken to asking such people, who tend
to arrive on Friday night/Saturday morning, Why have you come here? The
answer is, to party. Not that partying is bad, ask Baroness Morwydd of
Concordia of the Snows how seriously I party sometimes! But the point
is, these people are not necessarily playing by our rules of conduct.

You might dismiss this as paranoia. Not so. Last year, the nine year
old daughter of merchants who were encamped near us, who, I might add,
was largely unsupervised throughout the war, wandered off away from
the marketplace. She was missing for 7 hours, during which time we
practically turned the whole camp upside down. We found her naked and
crying in the tent of one of these people whom no one knows. (or is
willing to admit they know) The person was not arrested, because he
was away from his tent when she was found and he claimed he didn't
have any idea how a naked child wandered into his tent while he was
away. I don't know if he was telling the truth or not, but he left the
camp within the hour. 

Within the marketplace there have been some substantial thefts in
recent years as well. Personal possessions as well as merchandise have
been stolen, and you can ask Duchess Sedalia about the fellow who
bounced so many checks a few years ago.

Should a young lady walk unattended at the war? Sure. As has been
pointed out, there are countless good gentles who will spring to the
defense of anyone who cries out for help. Wandering about in the dark
at the war is one of my favorite things to do...the night air enhances
the non-twentieth century smells and sounds, and the darkness hides
the mundane tent silhouettes and non-authentic clothing. 

Should children be unattended at the war? If they are of legal age to drive
(ie 16 or 17, old enough to be responsible enough for decisions) I
think they could be unattended. Younger than that...they should be
attended by responsible adults. There are too many strangers, too many
sharp pointy things, too many flammable things, too many breakable
things, too many vehicles, too much deep water, too much poison ivy
and wasps...to be safe for unattended young children. 

The market place is not a babysitter, nor are the unwilling gentles
who happen to be camped next to you. If you can't or don't want to
take care of your children at the WAr, send them to camp while you
play the Game or leave them at home. Send them to Pages School if they 
are eligible and you want to have some free time during the day. Hire
babysitters at the war. But please don't let them roam. It is not an option.

If there are any Pennsic security officers on the Rialto, please share
some of your experiences with us. It's nice to believe that everything
is as it used to be, but it just ain't so anymore. The WAr is too big
for that kind of family-feeling nowadays.

In service, I remain,
Megan

Subject: new member grabbing

Greetings again from Megan : I know how strongly some of you feel on 
the subject of households, but I must disagree with Arastorm. 
Your early SCA experiences, as exciting and meaningful as
they were to you, are not necessarily the norm all over the known
world. Many households are political factions, not nursuries for
newcomers. It is the responsibility, duty and privilege of the office
of the Chatellaine to introduce new members to the customs and
activities of the SCA in general and the local group in particular. To
identify with a particular household is to identify with all the
political history of that household, past and present. This may not be
apparent to the newcomer. And I don't think it wise for a household
head to frivously accept all comers regardless into their fold, out of
a sense of noblesse oblige or out of desire for increased body count to
support a cause in which body count counts, or even out of a sincere desire
to welcome and educate new members. And you know as well as I do that
there ARE households which accept new members for all these reasons
and others. And sometimes they get burned, and sometimes the new
members get burned, too.  Your idea of fealty to a household and a new
comers will probably differ vastly. They should know what you require
of them when they swear fealty to your household. 

The nurture of new members is the responsibility of all members. This
is how we grow. In our Barony, we invite all first time visitors into
court to be officially greeted by the Baron and Baroness. At this time
we formally introduce them to the Chatellaine, briefly explain her
duties, introduce our other officers, and have the newcomers
introduces themselves outloud by name, (scadian or mundane if they have
no scadian name) so older members will know who they are for furthur
nurture or instruction. Our gold key garb is being designated with a
badge, which I think we will ask all newcomers and novices to wear
until they feel at home among us. That will ward off the stray
authenticity police (in OUR Barony? Heaven forbid!) and encourage
older members to take them under their wing. 

This is the function of the SCA as an educational organization. Yes,
Arastorm, there are householdes which do all these things, and they
should be commended for thier good labors, but not all households do
this. A new member may not be able to distinguish between the two.

Along the same lines, the unofficial-but-awfully-popular anthem of the
fencers in this region is "Wire Weenies from Hell". A nickname is what you
make of it, and doesn't have to be derogatory if you don't let it get to

Shouldn't be a problem. The only advice I'd give you, if you expect to move 
in a year, is to bear in mind that there is quite a bit of regional variation
from group to group, and that some of the customs will be different in the
group you move to. You shouldn't have any real problem with starting in one
group, then moving to another, so long as you don't base your entire
conception of the Society on the group you start with...

Subject: cost of knighthood, Vic. Gwenhillian

Greetings to the folk of the Rialto, from Margrethe von Holbeck!

Earlier messages say, (to condense greatly) that equipment and 
horses were ransomed back fairly cheaply after a tournament, due to the
horrendous and ruinous expense of knighthood, and further that knights
were required to maintain 3 horses.

As a former horse owner, I can say that the expense of keeping three horses
was very likely ruinous.  Consider that the average performance horse-
which would correspond to a light charger, I believe- weighs ~1000 lbs
and eats 20 lbs. of high quality alfalfa hay PER DAY- plus an unspecified
amount of oats, depending on how hard they're being worked.  Horses
which eat low quality hay will eat more of it.

Now consider that (today's) heavy draft horse, which is descended from
the heavy horses of old, weighs twice that.  Unfortunately, I do not
know how much selective breeding has changed their metabolism and
size over the past 700 years- but I do know that they eat a lot.
For a nonproductive animal- (their gaits are so rough that they were
led TO the battle and then ridden) that's a tremendous expense.  No
wonder they were quickly unloaded, at a fraction of their true cost!

As far as Vicountess Gwenhillian (sp?) is concerned, she is currently
living in the West.  She and her lord fought in the Mists Spring prize
lists yesterday.

Subject: Re:  authenticity versus fun

Greetings unto the Rialto from Sarra Graeham, courtesy of Lord Angus:

Lord Dani of the Seven Wells quotes Elaine Esperance:

I took the time to look up the Maltese Branle in Arbeau's _Orchesography_
before I saw Lord Dani's posting, and also found that what I had learned
as the Maltese was a modification on Arbeau's dance.  I think, however,
that Lord Dani might be underemphasizing the magnitude of the modifica-
tions, just as Lady Elaine was incorrect to say that the dance is not "one
bit period."

The dance, as I learned it in the SCA, with dancers in a ring, goes:
        Double left, double right, double left, double right [drop hands]
        3 steps into the centre [raise arms to snap fingers]
        Clap three times
    [turn 180 degrees after clapping, to step away from the centre, snap
    fingers as before]
        3 steps away from the centre
        Kick left, right, left
    [turn 180 degrees as you kick, seize hands to repeat the dance].
I know of several minor variations on this.

Arbeau's dance is a "mimed" dance which he describes as having been de-
vised for a Court masquerade by the Knights of Malta in imitation of the
Turks; it was supposedly first danced in France forty years before, i.e.
ca. 1549.  It is supposed to be in slow duple time.  I am not quite up
enough on dance notation to give a perfect transcription of Arbeau's steps
but simply put:
        Double left, single right
        6 steps forward toward the centre, holding foot in air on last step
    [dancers gesticulate and make appropriate faces, releasing hands after
    the 6th step]
        Turn to the left in four steps
        Kick left, right, left; bring feet together
    [take hands, and repeat, varying the gesticulations and faces]

There are some problems in interpretting this (eg. Arbeau instructs the
dancers to make six steps towards the centre, but never tells them to
come back, and even if you are supposed to travel away from the centre
while turning to the left, I still have this image of an ever tightening
circle ending up in a hopeless tangle, which I suppose *may* have been the
way the Knights of Malta envisioned the Turks).  I suspect that some of
the first SCA dance teachers, coming across this nifty mimed branle in
Arbeau, tried to sort out the difficulties by making three of the six
steps toward, and three out of the centre, amalgamating the turn to the
left and the three quick kicks to match the livelier music they were using.
This music also required more steps were required before the steps in and
out of the circle, so they substituted the common "DL, DR, DL, DR" pattern
for Arbeau's "DL, SR".

I have never found this dance apparently out of period, and I consider
it a good example of creating new dances from within the framework of
the existing ones.  (Although until very recently I had thought that the
version I knew was from Arbeau, and I think my teachers had fallen down
in the assumptions department, nor had I ever bothered to check.)  Any
dancemistress who refuses to dance this dance because it is "not real",
IMHO has rocks in her head.  It is well within the tradition it purports
to represent, and it has a reality within the Society.

Subject: Re: SCA Slang

Keywords: French; linguistics; pedantry.

        The abbreviation 'ASCAC' is given as 'French for SCA'.  While
not incorrect, some amplification might be of interest to those upon
the Rialto:
        The Shire de l'Ile du Dragon Dormant, for a long time the only
SCA group in the Canadian province of Quebec, found that they wanted to
register themselves with the provincial government for some reason or
other.  The official language of the province of Quebec is French, and
in order to register the group, a French name for the organization was
required.  (The Quebec government is very linguistically protectionist
these days.)
        A direct translation of "The Society for Creative Anachronism"
would be "Le Societe d'Anachronisme Creatif", if I'm not mistaken, save
for a few accents which I've elided.  Unfortunately, this yields the
acronym "SAC", which is French for "bag".  I assume that the potential
for bad humour is self-evident.
        Hence, the group decided to try for something which at least
contained the familiar letters "SCA", and came up with "L'Association
Socio-Culturelle d'Anachronisme Creatif", or "ASCAC", which doesn't
spell anything.
        I also recollect, as in a dream, that "le societe" and the
English "society" are not as connotationally equivalent as they may
seem at first glance, and that this also influenced the search for
a translated name.  Although I am prepared for correction in this,
I believe that a French "societe" is more often a commercial institution
than an English "society".  For instance, the French-language radio
service of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is "Societe Radio-
Canada".  Hence the absence of the word "societe" in "ASCAC".

The thing, is, that's not the only alternative.  In Calafia we have a
"Baronial Household" whose express purpose is to give new members a
place to eat, sleep, and pile their gear, and to teach them all this
stuff (often in organized, "class" settings, taught by people who have
given the same newbie lecture numerous times over the years).  As I
understand it (not having been around at the time), one of the reasons
the Baronial Household was formed was that certain households had a
habit of grabbing people for political advantage, and that a number of
new members had been thus grabbed, gotten involved in bad stuff
(including, but not limited to, illegal drugs and pagan rituals in
public), and eventually left the Society because they got in trouble,
or because they were disgusted with the game they were playing, and
didn't know there were others.

A new member who "wants desperately to find a lord or lady to whom to
give homage", who feels lost and very much wants a "sense of
belonging", has much less confidence and objectivity in choosing whom
to associate with than one who's been around for a year, gone through
the Baronial Household's series of classes, and seen how people act in
a variety of circumstances.

I've certainly seen households that "grabbed" new members to make
sure they had clothes, dinner companions, and a place to sleep, and
required little else of them (that's how I got started).  But there
are other kinds too.

Subject: W&S First? Can you hit the side of a Barn (door shield)?

Greetings to the Rialto!

As a general query, which kingdoms require that the fighter must be authorized
first before other weapons forms?


As a personal opinion, I've always felt that the w&s form should be the last
thing a fighter takes training in.  My reasoning is very simple:

The easiest way to teach anything is with diametric balance, i.e. doing the
same thing with both hands.  Therefore, two-sword is my choice for the initial
weapons form in training.  This form also reduces the vision occulsion and
"weapon shyness" or ducking traits that are so hard to overcome and correct
for in neo fighters.

The other forms are presented in the following sequence: two-handed sword,
spear/polearms, and finally, w&s.  Because it is so unbalanced, and takes so
much remedial work to correct for, I will not train anyone in W&S as an intial
form.

Note that this disscussion is on two related subjects; authorizations and
training.  While I may not be able to convince anyone to change the sequence
of authorizations, I can still specify the sequence of training for any who
wish it to be taught by me.

Dur the Nasty, Baron of Grey Matter

ps.  I prefer that all fighters start with a few prerequisite training
sessions in both archery and dance.  I also provide for concurrent training in
amoring and personna research in parallel with combat training.

In general, both methods seem to be acceptable.  My Knight approached me
directly (after sounding out my proclivities via my Lady) and asked if I would
be his squire.  We had been friends for several years, and (to paraphrase what
he told me) "several incidents had suggested to him that I would be suited to
becoming a Squire [he values Service very highly] so he decided to ask."  If 
you have a particular Knight in mind it might be wise to ask some gentles who
know him well (perhaps his Lady or someone else in the local group who has
ongoing contact with him (or her) to find out whether a new Squire would be
welcome (he may already have as many as he can handle).  Pursuing the matter
through an intermediary (again, the Knight's Lady, a mutual friend, whatever)
in the initial stages seems to be easiest in most cases.

Most Knights will want to observe the prospective Squire in action--both on
the field and off.  Each Knight has a particular set of parameters that a 
Squire must fill:  some look only at fighting skill/potential, others look at
courtesy, service, etc., and the best (IMHO) look at the whole picture and
desire well-rounded individuals.  Each also seems to have a personal ritual
that newly-taken Squires are to participate in (it may be a simple as a small
private ceremony with the members of the Knight's household to a full court
appearance with Buffeting and taking of oaths).

It's a worthwhile experience--just be sure to tell your friend to choose his
or her Knight carefully and to understand fully what it means to take the belt.
It's an honor (I feel different when I wear my belt & chain [my Knight, who
follows Midrealm tradition, gives his squires plain, fragile-looking silver
chains as symbols of personal fealty] and always strive to do my best in all
things) and a duty (to uphold Chivalry, to act with Courtesy, to serve 
without complaint), and must not be entered into lightly.

There *might* be a need for this in the more densely populated areas of

One is the response of mundane authourities to what amounts to a private
police force.

The other is Awilda's concern that individual responsibility being no
longer sufficent.  For my part, if this is so, then the Society is
dead and hasn't fallen over yet.  A large part of the point of this
exercise is to create a space where one can be in the company of
people who will respect your eccentricties without having to be
coerced into it.  If they won't even respect your person, it isn't
that difficult to get them to leave. (Scary, maybe, difficult, no.)

Subject: helm guage

Just to make your life truly wonderful, William, there are *many*
guage systems.  The Canadian one I am familiar with is pretty simple;
guage is the fraction of an inch the plate is thick. (16 ga. -> sixteenth
of an inch thick; 12 ga. -> twelfth of an inch thick, and so on.)

16 guage comes out to 1.5875 mm, so I suspect your 1.5 mm helms come
close to the american 16 ga.  Most helms around here are 14 ga., or
1.8 mm (approx.)  Of course, even if it *is* a little light by medival
standards, it is *much* more consistent steel than would have been
available to a medieval armorer.

I can remember speculating about what the eventual conclusion would
be if one could find a way to present some medival armorer with a
suit of 16 and 18 ga. stainless steel gothic plate... :]

The Crown Prince's name is "Rhys of Harlech".  He's from Harlech, not
the son of Harlech. :)   His lady the Crown Princess is Elaina of
Oaklawn. 

The other finalist (and therefore Admiral of the Armies), was Earl
Shannon an Chasur (aka King X).  Rhys defeated Duke Randal of the
Dark, and Shannon defeated Sir Wulfstan Thorhallsson in the

This is the most common list, but there was some variation, from
author to author, in who made the list.  Most commonly, the third
Christian, Godfrey de Bouillon, was replaced by some other warrior.
Some English authors used Earl William of Warwick, and I've also seen
Tirant lo Blanc on the list.  Some authors used this slot as a means
of honoring their patron, by inserting one of his ancestors.  German
authors differed more noticeably from this list.  I have an article on
the subject somewhere, if you're interested.

Just to Expand on Kwelland-Njal's brief post, 

Sir Rhys defeated Duke Master Randall in his semifinal bout. Rhys was
undefeated until the second bout of the final when Shannon was victorious
fighting polearm vs. polearm. The first and third bouts were fought sword and
shield and the third lasted a very long time with both contestants fighting from
their knees.

Other bouts of interest:
 Master Feral von Hallstern and Sir Gregor stalking around each other and
dragging their feet like orcs for several minutes before tearing into each
other. A knight who's name escapes me (Per saltire Sable and or, in pale two 
mullets of 6 azure) who spent nearly a half hour on his knees against Master
Feral and then found himself in nearly the same place two bouts later against
Magnus Bloodaxe...Both fights he lost, but his opponents were not well rested

Subject: Squiring

Unto the Rialto does Eliane Esperance send greetings:

Just another squiring story, slightly different.  I approached my
Knight, Sir Sebastian Nightwind, and asked to squire to him.  The came
after several months of training with him, and a great respect for his
fighting style, his teaching, and his chivalrous qualities.  Asking him
was, I think, one of the hardest things I have ever done.  I kept 
wondering if he thought I was a jerk, or a wimp, or even if he thought
of me at all.  However, he did accept me, and I have tried (am trying)
to live up to being Sebastian's squire.
This means going to practice when he does (even if it's raining), learning
to juggle, going (ugh) jogging with him after practice, playing...sorry,
*fighting* with his other squires, etc.  I enjoy every bit of it! (except
maybe the jogging part...)

I think what I mean to say is, you can wait until a knight spots you
and asks you to squire, or you can pick a knight that you really respect
and ask him.  The end result is the same.

                                -Eliane Esperance, squire to
                                 Sir Sebastian Nightwind

Subject: Newcomers; Households; Peer/dependent relationships

It looks to  me like the discussion of households  and their value/problems
is sliding into a separate topic of how to cope with newcomers.

On integrating newcomers into the group:  I must agree with Cher that  this
should  be the  responsibility of  the group  as a  whole.   The  canton of
Kapellenberg has nearly tripled, I estimate, in size in the year and a half
Fern and I  have been  here.   The only  way we've  managed to  cope is  by
everyone  chipping in  and  helping newcomers  to  acclimate.   We  have  a
Chatelaine who keeps loaner garb and feast gear, but we all help to get new
folks started.  One of the things Fern and  I like to do, and wish we did a
better job encouraging others to do, is to foster  a newcomer for an event.
An  experienced person, or in our case couple, take charge of making sure a
newcomer has a good  time at an event,  usually their first or second.   We
make sure they  have clothes, feast  gear, a ride  (sometimes just  telling
them they're riding with us), make sure they meet people at the event, have
a place to  sit with people they  know (probably with us) at  feast, and so
on.   We don't  do this  as recruiting  for household,  but as  experienced
people helping newcomers to figure out what is going on.  If everyone in  a
group does this a  couple of times a year,  it spreads out the work  a lot,
and makes a lot of new friends.

On  households:  Cher  said it well: "If  a group has  a strong identity as
such  _per se_, households  are far less  likely to  be a problem..."   The
Barony  of Windmaster's Hill  has a  _very_ strong  group identity,  to the
point that I think there are a goodly number of people not doing things for
themselves they should be  doing because they are more  interested in doing
things for the group.  This barony has no problem with  households, and I'm
convinced that it is  because the leaders of the households  that exist all
believe the  group identity  of Windmaster's  Hill is  more important  than
their  household developing a  separate identity.   As the head  of a house
believes, so will the members of the household.

Which  leads me to  yet another topic,  which was introduced  by LaMaia the
Barefoot, as  "How does  one go about  becoming a squire".   Speaking  as a
Laurel with apprentices,  who is also squired  to a Knight, there  are some
important  questions to  ask  that  are  associated with  this.    (In  the
following I  am  going to  use  the (I  hope)  generic  terms of  Peer  and
dependent,  for  which  you  may  insert  Knight/Master/Laurel/Pelican  and
squire/thane/apprentice/protege as appropriate.)  Why become a dependent to
a Peer?  What do you expect to get out of a dependent/Peer relationship you
wouldn't get otherwise?   [Side note - all the Peers I know willingly teach
their skills  to  anyone who  asks]   What  to  you expect  to  put into  a
dependent/Peer  relationship?     Why  are  you  interested  in  forming  a
relationship to  a particular Peer?   Why not some  other one?  If  you and
your prospective  Peer can't  agree on  the answers  to these  questions, I
suggest you not form that  relationship now - either a different Peer  or a
different time would  be better.  Also, there aren't any *right* answers to
these questions - obviously I have my opinions, and my apprentices  need to
have  compatible opinions,  or the  relationship  won't work.    I do  have
opinions about *wrong* answers to some of these questions, chief among them
being people who  want to form  a dependent/Peer relationship because  they
think being a  squire/apprentice/protege will give them increased status or
rank.  All my opinion, I'd be interested in what other people think.

Subject: Kids' Publication?

Dear Comrades,
 
I'm collecting information for parents of children under 12 who participate in
the Society for Creative Anachronism. I was wondering whether any of you might
have materials that you could share with us for this collection?
 
You may ask, why am I asking? (Well, I'll tell you...) I'm a relatively new
parent of two who's been in the Society all of my adult life (startling
thought). I have observed many Society parents who merge parenthood and Society
participation very successfully, even while holding down kingdom offices,
creating involved arts and/or sciences projects, or being Royalty. I'm hoping
to find and present ways for everybody - children, parents, and non-related
people - to enjoy Society events, and to develop some support for all of us out
here.
 
There are two major areas that I would like to address:
1) Strategies to help parents remain sane, present a reasonable appearance, and
possibly get a few things accomplished while dealing with children, and
2) Fun, interesting, energetic, medieval things for children to do.
 
Ideally, I'd like to find a publication already put together which has all of
the ideas, artwork, and thinking already done - why re-invent the wheel?
Failing that, I'm proposing to publish a newsletter about every other month,
with entries (articles, letters, quick notes, artwork) in many categories, some
of which follow:
How to make
   For kids
   For adults
   At home
   On site
Games to play
Activities
Ideas for parents
   cooperative nurseries
   interacting with other people's kids
   working with the autocrat
Forms
 
I'm not an expert or anything like it. I'm hoping to enlist the aid of people
who have studied early childhood development, sociology, and/or who are just
reasonably successful Society parents. I've got some ideas, but my skills and
resources are more general; I have access to and experience in desktop
publishing, I've published newsletters in the past, I have access to electronic
mail, and I would like to act as a clearinghouse for ideas and strategies. I'm
teaming up with several mothers mothers of young children in my Barony, and am
hoping to consult with teachers and other professional kid-people as well.
 
If all goes well, after about a year's publication the text will be re-set into
a volume that will be published as a book which will continue to be available
indefinitely, possibly through the Kingdom Information Office. This prevents
reprinting the same information for people who miss issues. As long as we
continue to get new information, we'll continue to publish. When the definitive
work is done, we'll close out and go on to something else - I don't actually
want this to be a life's work! In fact, if some other noble soul has already
done this or something like it, I will breath a heartfelt "Thank you, God!" and
just get copies. Failing that, I call on you out there: Help! How can I help my
kids want to go to events? How can I enjoy events with my kids?
 
If you've ideas, expansions on the above list, materials, and/or would like
information on getting the newsletter, please write to me:

Subject: Pennsic incidents and others (long)

onto the populous of the Rialto does Esmeralda La Sabia send greetings.

There are quite a number of incidents that I could relay, but I will try to
keep this short and only talk of two.

While at Pennsic, there are many chances to meet people, from sober to drowned
in alcohol, kind to nasty, sweet to obnoxious.

I once had the chance to meet a kind, drunk, obnoxious (at the time) lord.
I was at a friendly camp where I had a few friends.  This 'gentle' was making
unprovoked advances.  I not one to cry wolfe, (even when there is one),
attached myself to one of my friends, (as in held him by the waist) or made
sure that there was someone between him and I while I was at that camp.  I
believe that some people spoke to him that night or the next morning, and
he apologized to me the next day.  The amount of alcohol in a lord or lady
can have A LOT to do with how forward they will be with someone.  In my
experience, the best thing to do is

1) Bluntly tell the person that their advances are unwelcome,

if that doesn't work, (and with most drunk people it won't)

2) leave the area, escorted, or
3) keep a friend between you and the bewildered individual.

Also a friend of the opposite sex.  This seems to be more intimidating to
bewildered people.  If they think that you're going out with your friend,
they are more likely to back down, or not to make a move at all.  (NOTE:
DO NOT tell them you are going out with someone.  Don't get caught in a
lie.  It won't make the situation any better.)

Second Incident:

I was overly friendly with someone, and the person in question considered it
'a move'.  I realized my mistake.  I didn't confront the person, in case I
had misinterperted his reactions.  Instead I enlisted two of my friends to
sit on either side of me so that I wouldn't have to worry about what his
intentions were.  They turned out to be harmless, which is what I suspected
but wasn't sure of.

I have noticed, that in the SCA, things are looser than in mundane society.
I can kiss the husbands of my friends on the lips and no party will be alarmed
or upset at this platonic expression of affection.  A problem can come out of
this looseness sometimes.  Innocent flirting with people you hardly know is
NOT a good idea, ESPECIALLY at a large camping event like Pennsic.  Escorts
are not necessary IMHO, but common sense is a must.  And everyone will learn
from their own experiences (hopefully), but people with some common sense
should learn from others experiences.  Pennsic is much safer than the mundane
world, IMHO.  That does not mean that a few bad apples, or drunk people can't
spoil the fun for a great many gentles.

In service to the safety of all gentles,

Esmeralda La Sabia

	As an ex-Constable of the West and an ex-rent-a-pig (Burns
Sec'ty), I can answer this one -- police forces are generally quite happy
to have *WELL TRAINED* security forces operating in their areas.  This
means that the people must know that they are basically *watchcritters*
and *NOT* police -- they can watch and warn but not make arrests.

	Police departments cannot be everywhere, and they very much
appreciate having eyes and ears that they can depend on, who will call
them when there is trouble.  When I was in charge of security for an
event, one of the chief things I did was to call or visit the local
police/Sherriff's office/whoever, and explain what it was that we would
be doing, how many people we expected, etc., and get a number or a name
of someone to call -- I also made a point of inviting any and all of the
local Gendarmerie to drop in for a visit during the event.

	If you are polite and forthcoming, even the most reactionary
fascists can be convinced that they are displaying noblesse oblige by
being nice to you . . . .
