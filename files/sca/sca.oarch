In regards to archery,
     One of the types of shoots I have seen around here
(Southern Ansteorra) is the money pouch shoot. A cloth 
bag is filled with coins and suspended from a tripod. 
The object is to hit the bag and tear it. Any
coins which you dislodge are yours. This necessitates 
some alterations to the typical shooting line. The time
I saw it everyone shot in order going down the line so
it was known who had gotten the hit. When money fell
all shooting was stopped and the archer went up to 
collect his booty. I saw one bag (fairly thick) withstand
20 or so hits before it completely tore open but did allow 
a few earlier hits to dislodge some coins through tears
and such. The shooters got closer after every four or so 
arrows and there was a large effort to shoot quickly
one after the other to kepp the round from taking 
forever. This was run by Lord Leon Dunne of Bryn Gwlad
and Jusseric Allison of Bjornsborg. Just knowing them
I would assume this a documentably period shoot.

Eh?  Under USFA rules a valid touch is 500g for foil, 750g for epee.

And that's a very light touch!  I'd say your "average" touch is about
1 kg, maybe 1500 g for epee, and even that is no problem at all as far
as broken blades are concerned.  Masks are required to withstand a
12 kg punch test (the punch tip is about the size of a pencil point and
the mesh must be strong enough not to spread apart under that pressure.

There are some very heavy-handed fencers out there.  When I direct,
I have no qualms about giving warnings for brutal hits....there is
NEVER any reason to hit that hard, even in a fleche attack.

I am pretty sure that this is a worldwide figure...but yes, run-throughs
are not unheard of at World Cup level competition.  (Remember that
fencing is a lot more popular in Europe than it is over here; this
is a very small number of deaths for such a large number of participants.)

I would hazard a guess that one is more likely to be injured driving to/from
the tournament than on the piste!

If insurance is the main obstacle, couldn't fencers be asked to sign a waiver
freeing the SCA from any liability from fencing injuries?

Gentles,
 M'lord Robert of Ferness, I am probably mistaken but I was not aware of any
suggestions to determine kingship (kinghood, kingness?) by alternate heavy lists
one year and fencing (or swashing as they call it here) the next. But if they
have suggested such a thing I vehemently oppose it. I am Highly in favor of the
idea that one most compete in areas other than just beating other on the head
with a stick. A samuri not only had to be skilled with his sword he had to know
how to compose poetry, arrange flowers, and hopefully callig. And according to
what I was told, to be made a knight or master here in ansteorrea you have to
know at least some dances, be able to perform in a bardic manner(sing,play an
instument, write a poem, orate, or somethign along those lines), and create
something. Whether or not that is what actually happens I have some questions
about. But in any event the king is supposed to be the formemost knight (or
master) in the kingdom, if all of the above qualities are necessary to become a
knight why are they ignored when it comes to making a king?

Reply-To: joshua@paul.rutgers.edu


Greetings all!

Over the past couple years, there has been an active discussion of
fencing among the officers and Curia of the East.  The Fencers had
proposed to Curia that a new award be created for fencing.  This award
has since been created.  However, during this discussion, a number of
rather interesting points were made about fencing, the SCA, and how
they ought to go together.  Personally, I see no problem with fencing
in the Society, as longas it is done well, and in period style with
research to back it up.  The Eastern fencers, for the most part, are
exemplary in these regards.  I would, however, like to present some
thoughts for discussion.  I don't necessarily agree with all of them,
but I think they do represent the opinion of a large part of the SCA,
and explain why many gentles feel so strongly that fencing does not
belong in the Knowne World.

The SCA was founded to (re)create an idealized view of medieval
Europe.  Its center, from day one of year one has been the noble
armored fighter.  Our ideals of chivalry and honor, our social
structure of fealty and feif, grow from the code of the knight of the
late Middle Ages.  In short, the armored warrior holds a special place
in the SCA.  Many people with whom I have discussed fencing find that
activity the antethesis of what the SCA means to them, and therefore
find fencing unsuitable as a major activity in the Society.

I have seen and discussed the documentation for fencing in period, and
I would not dream of questioning its provenence.  However, the
"period" of the SCA is not really "pre-1600".  That is just a
convenient number which the BoD added to Corpora a few years back to
try and control thing to an extent.  The period of the SCA is a much
vaguer notion, which differs from place to place.  For most SCAdians I
have spoken to, the period of the SCA is the age of the armored
knight.  In that culture, and in the ethical code that comes with it,
noblemen do not brawl in the streets with foils, they fight on the
field of honor with sword and lance.  The paragon of the medieval
warrior is the chivalrous and honorable knight.  The paragon of the
fencer is The Three Musketeers, and their dirty tricks.  I have been
told by a fencer at a tournament "Chivalry has no place in the list of
fence."  This attitude seems to run exactly counter to the fundamental
ideas of the SCA.  I do not believe this attitude is prevalent, but I
do think many non-fencers perceive fencing in that light, and
disapprove of it for that reason: it just doesn't fit in the SCA.

The answer to this criticism is, of course, to show that fencing does
fit.  Create of fencing a sport fit for a nobleman, with the honor and
courtesy which should be present in any list, and most will applaud
as they would any new addition to the SCA.  Research and document the
styles and methods of the art, and fencing becomes as legitimate an
art as any.  There will still be many who do not agree that fencing
belongs in the Society, and probably a majority who feel it should
never be more than a fringe activity: the philosophical conflict with
their ideal of the Society is simply too strong, and since the center
of the Society IS in the age of armor, that ideal must determine the
course of the Society as a whole.

Lady Siobhan ni hEodhusa describes the Mists' experiment in Coronet
Tourney.

Many have lamented the reservation of roayl rank to fighters and their
consorts, and I can remember many discussions of various other ways of
bestowing the Crown.  (Gee, this ties in real nicely to the Philosophy
of Fencing letter I just sent!).  One big problem with any method
beside a tournament is the probable of judging.  In a tournament, it's
real easy to decide who won: it's the guy standing up at the end.  You
argue that he cheated, that he fought dishonorably, that he is slime
and scum and unfit to wipe your shoes on, but you can't deny the fact
that he won.  How can any other competition be judged so absolutely?
How can we guarantee that the judging of any arts competition could
possibly be fair?  There lies anarchy.  The arts in the SCA are
fraught with bitter politics as it is; can you imagine what would
happen if the Crown were at stake?  

Choosing our Kings and Queens from the bashers has its problems, but
it is fair in an important way, and it is considerably more authentic
than any other system: The SCA is supposed to be a military
aristocracy.  That's what feudalism is all about.

I thought that is what court garb was for! I don't mind metal when it is
between my one and only body and "War's desolation" (which can be pretty
desolate -- No fecal matter, there I was....), but not when I'm dancing!
Hand me down my short hoopalon when dancing is the game. (Damn the pinchers,
full pavane ahead! No smily, sometimes I should have worn armour.) Besides,
mail (chain, that is) gets in the way when you flirt. How boring.

of kingship - what's the difference whether a king earns his title with
a piece of wood or a rod of steel?  When fencing type weapons were used
in the past, the kings of the time waged war with mercenary armies and
cannon.  Before this, during the time of broadswords, kings often led
armies personally, and knew full well how to use their weapons on the
battle field.
   I do not intend to say that the king should become so solely by winning
a tournament, indeed, I certainly believe that the king should be required
to at least enter a certain amount of arts contests and should perhaps
be required to do fairly well there; in other words, the king should be a
well-rounded individual, not a stick jock only.  But alternating fencing
with rattan won't work.  I am interested in fencing, but do not believe
that Crown Tourney should ever be a fencing bout.  I believe that rattan
fighting represents a far greater part of the time period we all live in
and that it is more real than fencing in that historically this form of
fighting was around for a much longer period of time than fencing was.

Good idea, for some reason though I feel that this should be acceptable from a
marshal as well. Somehow, this has not been well received when I have seen (or
done) it.  In this area there seems to be a reluctance to tell people to scale
down to killing level. (This is not a grammatical error)

More good stuff. I especially point this out in demos, but am usually ignored.
"Whadaya mean? This is a tourney, and I'm gonna win!" Sometimes I find people
who are rino-hides as a way of life. I do not give names or instances freely, I
just keep a mental "Atrocity File" that colors my interactions with people that
show up in it with depressing regularity.

>TALK to the offenders.  That's one of the functions of the Order [of Chivalry].

Maybe Master Koby and any other Chivalry who are reading could start work within
their Kingdoms' order on this. It may be unpopular in some quarters, but I know
the East's Earl Marshal writes in Pikestaff objecting to things getting out of
hand every so often. This might make comments to fighters more acceptable from
other sources.

>And, of course, that waiver we all sign acknowledges the fact that we all
>take on the responsibilities and penalties for playing such games.

Um, maybe. I am dreading the day that someone whose family doesn't approve of 
the SCA gets hurt. Its one of the reasons I try to encourage hitting and
accepting lighter blows. Sometimes I get it wrong and am best used as a bad
example, but I try.

>Douglas Graywether
 
As I look at this posting, I see a whining about the status quo. This is not
what I meant. I meant to show some of the problems and point out that some
of the suggestions do not reach far enough. Maybe part of the problem is
allowing, if not encouraging, the stick jacquerie (I love that term!) to get
a fairly strong hold in this area. We have to grapple with the question:
"Is rattan combat a sport or a part of the whole re-creation?" If the second,
we face the follow up: "How do we encourage/instill the Victorian ideal of
chivalry (Let's face it) in this part of our re-creation?"

I do not see a "let's go back to the old days" attitude as a solution. We must
always look ahead, teaching new people about the Dream and not our
disappointments. As the founder(s) of my original group used to say, "The best
thing about the 'Good Old Days' is they're gone." (At least Thorvald did.)

Subject: SCA: Fencing


	As a mundane fencer who has made the transition to SCA
fencing, I can discuss a little bit about the problems both political
and practical.

First, as far as the Bod is concerned, Fencing is determined by
Kingdom standards (although they do have a new Laurel Marshal of Fence,
Don Tyvar Moondragon).  Thus, the primary problem is convincing a King
(and an Earl Marshal) that such a fencing group could be set up, and
really won't cause them any problems, quite possible by volunteering
to be Kingdom Marshal of Fence.  

As far as setting up safty standards for fencing, we have an easy
place to start, USFA safty rules.  The Bod also requires additional
protection for the back of the head, and we almost certainly want to
require equivalent protection rather than mundane fencing jackets, but
mundane fencing jackets with tunics tossed over are a place to start.

As far as learing how to fence in a period style is concerned, we have
several good sources.  They primary way that Lord Danulf (our esteemed
moderator) and I have been doing it is by using modern fencing
techniques and experimenting with doing them in the round, using the
left hand as a blocking insrument (currently East Kingdom standards
allow you to use (1) a leather glove, (2) a parry dagger, (3) a
buckler, (4) a second rapier (called case of rapier) and (5) a cloak.
They also allow experimentation with some other forms, such a beer
mug, but that is not as commonly done).  I am currently playing with
the stop thrust, which is a very interesting technique when done in
the round.  Of course, SCA fencing is done without right-of-way or
electronic scoring, so double kills are much more common.  We also
make a distiction between a kill and taking a limb, as they do in the
rattan lists.  

The second method of learning to fence involves looking back at period
fencing manual.  Yes, we do have instruction written in period
(primarily Italian sources, Fabris and Cappo Farro [sp?]) from before
1600, and a number of English ones from shortly after.  Thus, you do
not need to be cavalier to fence, its just that many cavaliers choose
to fence, which is more period for them, thus making the cavalier
fencers more noticable [not that cavalier persona's aren't noticable
in the first place].  Baron Patri has several of the English manuals
on microfiche and will make paper copies for a reasonable cost (the
cost varies, but is about $5/book).  Write to me if you are
interested.  Don Tyvar also has a rapier manual which is specifily
geared to SCA (Anstiorian) fencing.  I don't have my copy here, but I
will try and get that information to anyone who is interested.  

I, of course, could go on for hours on the subject, but I am running
late to Burrogh (college) meeting and dance class, so I will bid you
Peace and fairwell.

Subject:  Re:  What a crock! Ping-pong? Elbow broken? Heavy Sarcasm?

Interesting.  I've only seen a few injuries that I would consider serious
as a result of heavy weapon fighting.  The worst was definately a freak:
a left hander fighting a right hander, the left hander tried a wrap shot the 
back and his upper arm hit the edge of the right hander's shield. The torque
of his weapon causes enough stress to split his upper-arm bone lengthwise.
The force involved was not extreme, it was just a freak occurance.  The
others I have seen are usually from bad helm padding or a rivet whos time
had come, minor cuts really.  The worst I've ever experianced was a torn
tendon in my left hand, again due to torque, not force.  If someone's
ribs get broken and people think that your blows are light then something
is seroiously wrong in that neck of the woods!  I deliberatly over armored
my ribs just out of caution (two layers 18 gauge steel, two of 8 ounce
leather, and 1/3-1/2 inch closed cell foam) and have had it bent 45 degrees
out of the plane without brusing, but I informed the party that that was 
too heavy a blow.

If there are that many injuries in your area then I wouldn't want to 
fight there...  And I'm as "brain-damaged" a fighter as you are going to
find.

Subject: Crown Tourneys, Music in the Society - Questions from Outside


Gentles,  Lords and Ladies,

May I present a poor mundane in need of advice?

He has been invited by one of his friends in the Society to attend a "Crown
Tourney" this weekend. His friend has explained a bit of what it's all about,
but he's still not sure quite what to expect, how to act (at least he and his
wife have fairly accurate early 1600s Highland costume, left over from last
All Hallows Even), and so on.  Even worse, it seems even the camping gear
might be considered inappropriate - mundane things such as coleman stoves, a
giant three-room tent (he owns a smallish backpacking tent, but doesn't relish
kilting up within *that*), utensils, etc. Advice is desperately sought, for 
he departs on the morrow and his friend is unavailable.

He wonders also about music in the Society, being a piper and his wife a
Scottish harpist.  This mailing list has been full of information about
fighting in the Society, both on the field and off (:-), but little of the
finer arts. Perhaps it's the threat of smashed fingers and broken wrists
that limits the participation of musicians?

Subject: Re:  Cabbages and Kings

This five-fold list for a tourney sounds *fascinating*. I wish I'd been
there; it sounds like just the kind of way I'd like to see Crowns held.

The major problem, it seems to me, is inertia. We have twenty years of
tradition here, and even the most liberal people are loathe to drop that
in favor of new ways, even if those new ways are "better". It simply
isn't clear whether the mechanisms of the Society are capable to making
changes that are this *radical*. This seems to be why many of the
splinter groups get formed: someone has a good idea that doesn't conform
to the SCA's Way Of Doing Things, and can't get the Society to change,
so they go off and do things their own way.

I'm just curious: how many people think that the current method of selecting
kings is the "right" way to do it, and how many want to see something
different? Unless you've got something really fascinating to say, send
email directly to me, rather than clogging the whole SCAnet. If I get
interesting replies, I'll summarize to the group.

Subject: Level of Blows

I speak as a Master-at-Arms of the East.  I have had almost no contact
with other Kingdoms, and am at present relatively inactive on the Touring
Pro Circuit.  "Back when i was good" :-) i had a reputation for skill and
speed but not power, and have always been respected for my Wimpy Eastern --
uh, i mean Chivalrous -- calibration level, both giving and taking.  :-)

The main problem as i see it is that there is no effective feedback to
fighters except in extreme cases.  Most of this is caused by sheer numbers;
there are a great number of fighters and relatively few members of the
Chivalry.  If some of the Chivalry are also problems (which point i grant
for the sake of argument only) then things become that much worse.

What the fighters in general, and the Chivalry in particular, need is a
Rhino-Hotline.  Whenever you think you've been pounded to hamburger
unnecessarily, or feel that your best imitation of a 16-ton weight really
*should* have carried the day, you call the RH and detail the incident.
The RH keeps records, and whenever anyone wants to check on his or her
reputation, he or she just calls the RH and checks the file.

There are, of course, details to be worked out and problems to avoid, but
the basic concept -- written complaints -- doesn't exist at the moment.
I can't imagine anyone taking up the thankless task of keeping track of
everything, but no doubt it could be parlayed into a position of authority
in the Kingdom, so maybe someone will.

Enough for now.

Subject:  Re:  Iron Key and teaching and fencing

In the Barony of the Steppes (Dallas, TX) we had both loaner armor and
a loaner helm at the time I started.  The armor was carpet, the helm
was a beat-up Spanghelm, but they were enough to give people a 
taste of what they were getting into.  Over the years they were phased
out and I don't know if they were replaced.  
	I'm in the process of getting a loaner helm for our shire here
in Lexington.  I'm ordering a number of helms from an old friend in 
Ansteorra, and charging a $5 extra to cover the cost of the loaner.
Once we get that we'll start on loaner armor...
	It is a good idea, but the problem is that you have to be
careful that your loaner gear is safe.  I think velcro tabs and several
individual pieces of padding will make the helm safe, the armor is
still in the design stages. Ideas anyone?

	As for fencing...  I'm a moderately proficient (mundane) fencer.
I've never been injured (except for some bloodied knuckles when a new
fencer tried to sabre fence with a foil  :-)  though I have had a number 
blades break on me over the years... it is scary.  I have had a friend
stabbed (though not seriously, only 1/2 inch penetration.)  All of this
was using the mundane fencing standard of 350 gram touches.  In Ansteorra,
the only Kingdom I've lived in that allowed fencing, the standard SCA
touch was expected to be 500 grams, using normal fencing blades, WHICH
ARE *NOT* MADE FOR THAT LEVEL OF STRESS!  Is it any wonder that there
was a shorter blade-lifetime?   And unlike broken rattan, broken 
foils are potentially lethal.  

	I *would* like to see fencing in the society.  But it would have
to be using normal fencing rules.  The changes that I've seen made are
not improvements, and, in my opinion, are inherantly unsafe.  This isn't
an opinion I formed in the Middle.  I fenced once in Ansteorra and then
went back to heavy weapons for precisely the reasons I give above.

I will assume that the lady, Coranna is being at least somewhat sarcastic 
here.  Though I am ashamed to admit it, I am personally responsible for one 
gentleman (wearing heavy gauntlets) having a shattered thumb, another 
gentleman for have a permanently slightly dislodged shoulder, another 
gentleman have 3 cracked ribs (he was wearing reasonably good body armor, but 
a drop snap blow dropped perfectly under the shield as we both leaned our full 
bodies in towards each other.)  All this with a short sword less than 25" 
long.  

And several of my fighting instructors, have in the past, ridiculed me for 
fighting with such a light weapon.  No kidding.

You can see why I'm in favor of light, clean blows.  Any hardhead out there 
who wants to fight me using heavy heavy calibration is going to get what he 
asks for.  >Disclaimer< "Don't ask the goddess for something.  She'll give it 
to you."  One of the reasons that I gave up fighting was that I could hurt 
people given the standard calibration of blows, and the number of people 
saying "light!".  I don't like hurting people, ever.  The three blows above 
were all ones that onlookers and the participants involved felt were "unlucky 
blows", with sufficient precise placement to hit exactly in the wrong place.
It still didn't stop me from feeling bad.  In the latter two cases, 
the gentlemen didn't even know that they were seriously hurt until much later. 
I mean, they knew that they were hit good, but they didn't know that any real 
(nonbruise) damage had been done.  

I have seen lots of other damage of this sort dealt out.  Heavy listing is, 
and was when I was fighting, dangerous.

Wanderscribe came dam' close to taking it, despite the fact that he didn't

period kings had to be able to fight, and many of them won their kingship

that extends beyond flush privies and hot&cold running water and no bubonic

Or better, attach a circle of paper to the ring (perhaps with the all-
pervasive grey tape?), so if the arrow goes through there's no question
about it.

Another: I saw this on the Cable "Robin Hood" -- a saddlebag-sized leather
bag is hung from a tree limb; somebody sets it swinging and gets out of
the way; people try to shoot it while it's still swinging.  Could be fun!

Subject:      Mundane fencing
To:           SCA@AI.AI.MIT.EDU


I was surprised to hear that fencing has been "outlawed" anywhere in the
SCA--but stranger things have happened.  I would like to clarify some of
the more mundane aspects of fencing.  I am an SCA fencer, as well as a
mundane fencer.  I have been fencing in the mundane competitve world
for 15 years, and I have only heard of two serious injuries.  One was a
high school fencer who took a broken blade through the thigh (and lived
to fence again), the other is the unfortunate incident at the
Olympics? World Championships? where an epee fencer took a broken blade
through the mask (fatally).  I have been keeping in touch with the fencing
news and would be surprised if things have been happening that I was
unaware of.  All mentions of fencers who have recently died seem to be
limited to mundane reasons, like car accidents and heart attacks.

On the lighter side of things, the fencing world is constantly changing
(electric sabre at Nationals this year--for division II finals).  More
sturdy lames and more flexible blades (less likely to snap) are being
improved all the time.  Mundane or SCA, the worst fencing injuries I've
ever had are bruises and an occasional twisted ankle (from falling over
my own feet).  Maybe the West can take another look at the situation.

As far as fencing armor, mundane protection (or the equivalent), preferably
covered with garb is the norm, with the additional of: a glove on the off
hand, back of the head protection(we fence in the round), and additional
throat protection.

Now, on a personal level, I have observed the same phenomina in SCA fencing
as in fighting.  Some people have to be hit far too hard to get their
attention.  Others calibrate at one level, and fight at another.  I find
myself worrying if fencing will go the way of fighting and fencers will have
to wear more armor for their own protection.  My (current) favorite solution
to the problem (in the East):  require fencers to use *lighter* foil blades
instead of epee blades  (currently either is acceptable).  It is impossible
to hit as hard with a foil as with an epee.  Given the same amount of force
behind the blow, the foil will *give* and bend far more than an epee.

Sorry I've been so wordy, but I wanted to set the record straight.  Some of us
SCAdians take this mundane fencing stuff seriously.

                                I remain,
                                  Elektra Leonidas

Subject: Rolling back time for fighting

Greetings to all!
	Your discussion about a lighter fighting style that emphasizes skill has 
caught my attention.  I am Tamsin Averil, a relatively new member who is 
currently trying my hand at rattan.  I am disturbed by the trend I see 
towards large amounts of force and near-brutality in some subsets of 
fighting.  (Excerpt from a conversation overheard at a recent training 
session: "Don't stick your arm out like that!  If you do, I'll break it!)
Don't get me wrong -- I can throw blows with adequate force, according to 
several experienced fighters who are not "rhino-hides", and I am not afraid 
of getting hit, but I am not learning rattan fighting to end up maimed.  I 
just thought it would be fun, especially some of the less standard weapons 
forms such as polearm or spear (I know, I know, first I have to authorize 
in weapon & shield [East Kingdom law]).  
	I know quite a few fighters of both sexes who fight for fun or who like 
to fight at the War and who are not interested in fighting just to win 
tourneys (why would anyone want to be queen or king, considering all the 
funny clothes you have to wear :-)).  I say let those "gentles" who wish 
to beat each other senseless have fun doing so, and I'll play with the 
"wimps" & "wusses" who are trying for chivalry and skill.  Vivant to all! 
I'm not trying to compete with the real heavy hitters for prizes and glory; 
they seem to enjoy that sort of thing, so by all means let them continue.  
I heartily support forming some sort of group for fighting for "the rest 
of us".  
	Tamsin

Subject: Iron Key and teaching and fencing

That is a marvelous concept.  I am going to bring this up to the Knight-
Marshall of my local group and see what we can do.

I am boggled that a competent non-belt would be told not to teach newer
fighters, as in the West teaching is one of the prime considerations for
any peerage.  A swordjock who fights because it's fun and gives nothing
in return to the Society is not, in my humble non-peerage eyes, showing
those traits that are supposed to make a peer.  If an excellent fighter
shows that s/he is knightly material, behaves as a peer, and uses
his/her skills _to the benefit of the kingdom_, this person will be 
granted knighthood.  

In response to the gentle who inquired about fencing, it's about time
someone showed some interest.  In the West Kingdom fencing at an SCA
event is Forbidden by Kingdom Law.  Safety standards were cited as the
reason for this.  I would like to know what the armor standards are for 
Kingdoms that do a lot of fencing, and how safe people think this is. 
It was quoted to me (and to the rest of the kingdom) that two to four
*lives* are lost per year in mundane fencing tournaments.  Since the 
society's insurance places heavy fighting in the same danger level 
as ping-pong, the King didn't want to endanger this standing.  (I'm 
told that the only reason it isn't classsified with chess and backgammon
is that Kevin Perigrinne got his elbow broken back in a single digit
AS when rigid elbow protection was unknown) Since the East and other 
kingdoms have fencing at events with great regularity, I think this is
a fine forum for its discussion within an SCA context.  Maybe we can 
get some light shed on the west coast.

Combo replies make for one longer posting instead of several short
ones.  What does the list think of this?  (I'm just interested in too
many things at once)

It has always been my assumption that anything I say over the ARPANET is 
public information anyway.  I therefore don't say anything that I'm not 
comfortable with anyone - reporters, government agencies, etc. hearing.
There actually though is very little that I won't say. 

On the other hand, I like what Arval said.  Perhaps a disclaimer could be 
attached as a header to all alt.sca transmissions (since the transmissions 
obviously can cover nonSCA'ers much more easily).  While I know nothing about 
"Alt" stuff, it might cover ourselves with respect to say the BOD, if it can 
be done.

I'm sorry, but I thought that Sophia (Shava) had asked a reasonable question 
the other day when she asked why can only (minimum requirement) swordjocks get 
to be king?   I told her that so far, no one had ever explained it 
sufficiently to me, and mostly I just got arguments which boiled down to:

Well, it's just not done that way, we don't plan on changing it, we don't want 
to change it, it would be lots of trouble, and the swordjocks would raise a 
fuss. 

Sometimes I got:  It's the ultimate expression of fighting, like a Laurel or 
Pelican is the ultimate expression of arts or service.  

On the other hand, you don't get neat titles like count or duke for being a 
laurel.  One of the fun things about joining the society is to get to add 
things like that to your persona.  

Kings get to do lots.  There ought to be a better way.  How about setting 
fencing up as an alternative form.  This would at least give many more people 
a much fairer chance at obtaining the honor through right of arms.  Then we 
could alternate between heavy lists and fencing Crown tourneys.  It would also 
legitimize fencing as an SCA activity, and give it the attention that it's 
going to need by the right people (which is to say also lots of people, not a 
select few) such that it develops well.

Good luck. Would you be willing to consider moving down into New Jersey?
(Barony of Settmour Swamp to be exact.)  A few years ago, this type of
proposal was introduced in this general area. The seeming consensus of
"Established Peerage" was that if people wanted to start fighting lighter,
then they should form a new type of fighter, "light infantry" as it were.
However, if they wanted the "benefits" of fighting, i.e. knight/masterhood,
competing in crown, and the like, they would just have to grow up and fight
with the real fighters. I am using these words and these connotations
deliberately, sir. That was the stated attitude of a number of the Knights,
coincidentally those seen as having increased the calibration. (well,
perhaps not so coincidentally.) There are people here who have been
fighters in the past, who stopped for mundane reasons, who are now *afraid*
to fight again, because they see a trend. We have people telling novices
"Dont hold your arm that way, cause someone will break it." Not "it is a
bad position and easy to get hurt in."  We have as a novice trainer someone
who has much martial arts experience in general, who prefers a light
calibration for safety, and who stresses general exercise and warming up in
addition to swatting at pells and practice fights. This person was recently
told by a Countess that he was doing a disservice to the society, since
only knights should train others. 

From what I understand, this is common throughout the East. I desperately
hope I am wrong. If you know anyone from "the old school" who lives in teh
area and is willing to join a cause of sorts, please let them know we need
some support. We have only one peer in our group, and he seems to be
actively fighting us. 

Are there any other people of the old school around? If things dont change
soon, we may well lose some of our most involved people to Markland.

And to anyone who thinks I shouldnt be airing dirty laundry on the net, I
am mostly using my local experience to point out that Lord Eduardo'
experience are **not** limited to his local group, nor are they merely the
dissatisfaction of a local few. I have heard that other kingdoms have also
gone through periods of "high calibration", and that it has died down by
itself. Is this true? Was there any action taken by anyone to help/hinder
this behavior?

contents:

	thankyou
	my feeling and intentions
	network realities
	the threatening future

Arval brings up a good point.  Thankyou for thinking about it. 

----------------

Let us look at the initial reason I formed this list.  To spread information
and ideas across geographical boundries.  To provide an information pool.  To
increase communication between SCA participants.  To break down regionalization.

I have not limited the distribution to MEMBERS_ONLY.  Nor, do we limit the
attendance of events to members only.  Another topic for discussion might
be that is my role as a moderator that of a Seneschal, Chronicler, or 
Autocrat?

When I started this list I did not expect it to be a forum to air dirty
laundry.  That was nieve.  This is a perfect forum to deal with problems.
Yet, I, who is facing some fairly monsterous political dung-heaps, feels
that this is still TOO PUBLIC to air some of the dirty laundry that I am
sitting on.  Maybe it is just too ripe, or this list is simply too public.
We have over 100 sites receiving this mail... and much of it is redistributed.

Anything over these networks is public knowledge.  Anyone can request to be 
part of this list.  *IT* is public knowledge.  Anything written down is in the
public domain.  Should we silence every "ripe" topic?  No, I think if a person
wants to find out about the SCA, they should know about our good and our bad.

-----------------------

Now lets look at some realities.  SCA@AI.AI.MIT.EDU must move to its sister
machine MC because we are overtaxing that system.  We have over 100 sites
being mailed to at this time and our receiving requests each day for additional 
subscriptions.  Given the traffic of mail each day, we will overtax MC as well,
but we will not anger anybody, to much, doing it (MC is a machine dedicated to
mail and mailing lists).  The moderator, me, is overworked and is spending at 
least three hours a day maintaining the list... more on weekends.  (With work,
I can make this process more efficient.)  That is in addition to his normal 
workload.

SCA@AI is growing, and growing too fast.  In order to deal with the system over-
load those users who want, will tolerate, or can be convinced will receive a 
digested version of the mailings. Some users will receive sca@ai via alt.sca
newsgroup.  The rest will receive it in the same form as it is now.  

----------------------

If we do not support alt.sca, I will have to support the users who wish to
participate in this forum who would do so through alt.sca.  In time, any 
host site will find problems with the traffic and INSIST on digesting this
list.  MANY of you do not want to digest it.  If we do not allow some method
to relieve the "pressure" of its distribution... then its future is as a 
digest.

To: sca@ai.ai.mit.EDU

I think that most fighters would agree that blow calibration levels and
armor standards have been rising for years.  In my experience (I've been
fighting for about 7 years) the rise has been pretty steady.  For as long
as I can remember people have been worrying about it and trying (without
success) to slow it down.

The trend should come as no surprise, however;  fighting is set up to reward
people for winning and increasing your personal calibration level by a hair
always gives you a bit of an edge in a fight.  The only force holding back
the trend is restraint based on chivalry and honor.  It's been pretty
effective;  after all it's taken 20 years to reach current calibration levels.
I don't think it can ever be totally effective, however;  it's just not
a rigid enough barrier.

This suggests to me that efforts to start 'light fighting' groups are doomed
to failure.  No matter how good the intentions, the basic rules of human
nature will apply and calibration levels will creep up.  Fencing was started
up in this Kingdom (the East) to fill just this role, but I understand that
the local variants of "light!" and "glancing!" have already started to appear
in fencing bouts.

So, let me suggest an alternative that I'm sure will meet with roars of
approval (or roars of some kind, anyway).  Would it be possible to decide
what level of blow was excessive and then not acknowledge anything heavier?
This would immediately introduce a sort of inverse rhino-hiding, (Whap!
"Light, my Lord!" Whap! "Heavy!" Whap! "Glancing!") but at least it would
provide an excuse for not falling down that would push blow levels down
rather than up. 

The question of how to choose the 'excessive' level immediately arises.
In response, I would point out that we don't have a mechanism for setting
the force of a minimal killing blow either.  Different people and different
groups would have different maximum levels, just as they have different
minimums now.  We would just be left with a situation where the tendency
would be for the maximum to drift *down*.

(Of course, it would be simple to build a machine that would deliver
a standard killing or excessive blow, but one off-the-wall idea per post
is enough).

HEY, VEASLLS: Is not to get headache over strange words.  Is barbaric otherland 
speak, means: Hello out there!  Here is letter: Is to be Bard named Siobhan.  
Is to like sing, play harp, cut leather, pull needle, throw shuttle, tell 
story.  Is to speak lots tongues, play lots music-makers.  Is to send good 
feelings from Fog-land (next to other Big Sea).  Have fun at war!  Is to stop 
now.

I am Lady Siobhan ni hEodhusa, of the hereditary bards to the MacGuire of 
Fermanagh in the 11th century, sojourning in the land of the Cymry owing to my 
father's bad luck in being born the youngest son.  In these Current Middle 
Ages, I have been Bard of the Principality of the Mists, a position won in open 
competition (which gained me the Order of the Golden Branch).  For my work in 
the arts, Rolf the First was gracious enough to award me the Order of the Rose 
Leaf.  My interests are poetry (in particular elder poetic traditions), harping 
and other instrumental music, leather and textile arts (embroidery, weaving), 
and storytelling.

Mundanely, I am Leigh Ann Hussey Oster, and make my trade by writing (several 
short stories published, the latest in last December's DRAGON magazine) and 
selling tapes of my music (PANTHEON, a tape of ethnically diverse instrumental 
music garnered a rave review in May's ELECTRONIC MUSICIAN; HOMEBREW is my 
latest, a tape of Pagan songs).  I was introduced to the Society through the 
College of St. Katherine (UC Berkeley, where I got my BA in music).  My 
interests here include languages (I'm almost-fluent in French and Welsh, with a 
smattering of other Germanic and Romance languages, with Old Icelandic soon to 
join the pack), music (play 15 instruments and sing, not necessarily all at 
once), folklore of Northern Europe and aboriginal North America, multiple 
handicrafts (full list on request), and the Old Religion (in particular the 
European shamanic tradition) -- I've been a Witch for over 5 years.
 
I'm very glad to have this electronic forum!  With all the techies in the SCA, 
it's long overdue ... <grin>  I've been "gafiating"* lately, due to 
disillusionment with the politics and stick-jocking, but I'm more than happy to 
put to use whatever knowledge I have that may be deemed useful by this 
Electronic Province (maybe we could give it a name? how could we get it 
approved by the BoD... <wicked grin>).

Subject:  Re:  'light lists' etc

Hmmmm, I had always attributed the increase I had noticed to having moved
from one Kingdom to another.  In fact, I still think that there is a signifi-
cant difference between Kingdoms.  When I fought in Ansteorra we took light
blows, I had a perfectly good set of armor for the way we fought.  When
I first fought in the Middle I found I needed to upgrade, but only in
that I hadn't covered everything.  Now everything is covered but they
still take blows hard up here.  I have also been taking my blows light.
When a local member of the chivalry tried to get me to twist into my blows
I pointed out that I shouldn't *need* to, the *official* rules (The 
Marshalate Handbook for the Middle) say it is the cleanness of the blow,
not it's force, that is supposed to dictate what is killing and what
is not "unless the blow could not be delivered with sufficient force in
the first place." (or something like that.)  e.g. wrist-flicks.  Hell,
I can military press 180 and have been fighting for 6 1/2 years; I *can*
deliver a killing blow.  And I think that what the experianced fighters 
here think is a killing blow is at least half again too hard.

At Pennsic last year a Lord Peter, of Nant-y-Derwyddon in Meridies, was 
running an experiment on blow callibration.  I still havn't seen the 
official results, and I had asked to sent a copy  regardless of his 
findings.  I did help him run it for a while on Thursday, and saw 
belted fighters who hit as little as 24 inches as a *heavy* blow, to 
one who hit it well over 100 (like 130 maybe).  That's a difference of
nearly 5 times as hard a blow!  

I agree that it is time to do something about the problem.  But I don't
think that creating a completely separate list is the way to go about
it.  In the past I have seen the Chivalry make a move to counteract
a tendancy to take heavier blows.  We just need to convince the Chivalry
*of the entire known world* that there is a problem.  Then we need to 
decide what is "too heavy" a blow in terms that anyone can reproduce.
Till then...

As a new (and still unqualified) fighter, I've one comment on fighting
in the SCA.  I decided to get into fighting because it looked fun.  It is
fun.  The group I practice concentrates on making it play - a rather
intense play, but play nonetheless.

At our last tournament, I also found the Bergental Mourners Squad lots of
fun -- we mourned our dead fighters, chased the victors off the field etc.

Still fun, just different ways of having fun.

Hear, Hear!

   Far too often have I heard (and voiced) grumbles over the constant
additions of armour that is being required.   True, due to some fighters
predilections for "leaden maces", etc. this armor MAY be helpful for safety
reasons, but what-in-the-name-of-all-that-is-sacred is the Order of Chivalry 
for?  We should be responsible for our own safety.  If someone is hitting heavy,
have the Order of Chivalry pull him (or her) aside for a chat.  During
"listen-ups" honor and chivalry should be stressed, and all involved should
be admonished against fighting just to show your strength/prowess.  Most of
all, everyone should remind themselves that those folks in the armor that
you are hitting are your friends.  You don't want to hurt them, and they 
don't want to hurt you.  Use control, not power.  Ultimatly, always remember:
It's a dangerous game.  Wear the armor YOU feel is necessary.  Don't pass
heavier and heavier armor regs. because people are hitting heavy.  TALK to
the offenders.  That's one of the functions of the Order.  And, of course,
that waiver we all sign acknowledges the fact that we all take on the respons-
ibilites and penalties for playing such games.

Hey, neat!  Any other fencers out there?  (I've been a fencer about 4 years,
all three weapons, and am currently the captain of the UCB epee team...)

I was led to believe that USFA-style fencing was looked down upon by the

Would this be an appropriate forum to discuss fencing?  To get the ball

Subject: Loaner Armor
Message-Id: <579988548/kee@NL.CS.CMU.EDU>

About four years ago, Lord Nis von den Eichenberger came up with a good
idea on this topic--the creation of a local minor office, under the
Knight Marshalate, known as the Iron Key.  It stores, maintains, loans
and keeps track of extra armor.  We started with the unclaimed Lost and
Found armor from Pennsic XIII, plus a number of local contributions.
The Iron Key currently can field about three complete sets of armor,
many and varied weapons (illegal unclaimed weapons are dismantled and
used to make legal ones), extra helms, gauntlets, gorgets and various
other small pieces.  

Additionally, for the past few years the Iron Key has collected the
Lost and Found armor from Pennsic and sent notices to that effect to 
the Kingdom newsletters.  People who have lost armor and weapons at
Pennsic have until Twelfth Night to notify the Iron Key, see if they
have the piece in question (sometimes we don't), and arrange for its
return.  After Twelfth Night, anything left reverts to the BMDL; we
give away some of it and refurbish other pieces.

Most of our nicer pieces are from private contributions.  Nice things
left at Pennsic are rarely left unclaimed.  Since this is the case, I
think that the Iron Key idea would work in other groups as well.  The
main requirements are dry storage space and the ability to handle some
recordkeeping.  Our current officeholders are good at fixing stuff, as
well, but this could be done by outside volunteers.

We have also funded the purchase of extra helms for Iron Key from
general Baronial funds.

Does anybody else out there have a similar system in place?

Reply-To: joshua@paul.rutgers.edu



Greetings!

I note that Lord Tofi has arranged an automatic interface between
alt.sca & our mailing list.  This is an interesting arrangement, very
convenient for those of us who have been receiving 30-40 letters per
day on the mailing list, and rather a neat setup, all things
considered.  However, this connection effects a serious change in the
nature of the mailing list, one which we may want to consider
carefully.

Alt.sca is a public newsgroup, distributed all over the world.  It can
be read by anyone, and anyone can post to it.  It cannot be restricted
in any way.  The mailing list is a private discussion forum for SCA
members only.  We can discuss anything we want, air our dirty laundry,
without any worry about bad publicity or other ill effects.  Consider,
for example, the potential effect of the recent discussions of
paganism in the Society.  In light of the recent unfortunate incidents
of one idiot giving the SCA lots of loud bad press, I think we have a
duty to be very careful about how we distribute our discussions, or a
duty to restrict our topics.  Either solution is unpleasant, but I
think we would be foolish to discount the problems that might arise
from the current setup.  

Therefore, I have asked Lord Tofi to temporarily dismantle his
interface, and I ask all of you to think about these matters and
express your opinions.  I would like to see a clear consensus one way
or the other before we commit ourselves.

Yours in service to the Society,

Subject:  Re:  Getting Started in Heraldry

Greetings gentles.  I am still attempting to get a start in
heraldry, so maybe I shouldn't be speaking.  However there are
one or two things which come to mind, so please bear with me
and grimace not too much.

First let me give one very easy method of becoming a Herald.
You must live in a place which is starting a new group.  In the
case of this area, we are starting a College as an adjunct to
the local Shire in order that the Shire may have easy access
to University facilities.  As we were organizing the College
I found myself volunteering to be the Herald, which was fine
because I have owned a copy of Fox-Davies since long before
learning of the Society.

Now as to source books.  I currently have the aforementioned
Fox-Davies book which, I believe, is still available from such
places as Publishers Central Bureau.  There is a new book which
I have which they call _A_Dictionary_Of_Heraldry_.  I do not
remember the publisher but the author is one Stephen Friar
and seems to be active in the British College of Arms.  I do
not know how applicable it is to Society heraldry, and in fact
in the entry which lists other heraldric societies our College
of Heralds is not listed at all.

But please have patience for the book does have some useful 
information.  Contained in this tome are many details of heraldric
practice through the last few hundred years.  When a particular
practice is relatively new, it is labeled so.  It does not dwell
overmuch on British heraldry either, but covers practices from
other countries.  There are also a number of examples of modern
heraldry and grants of arms.

The cost is around $20 if I remember correctly (oh, hardback on
those newfangled slick clay-coated pages, with a slipcover).

I have never been to the war, but when I was growing up in Vermont (I was
blooded in bow season in 1975 with a two point buck) we used to take harness
rings and hang them from tree branches, and try to shoot through them.  I'm
not sure how you could marshall that (we used to argue if we'd made it or not)
but it was certainly a traditional target practice where I came from.  Per-
haps you could use a bit of clay to loosely attach a bit of paper behind the
ring, so if the arrow went through, it would pierce the paper?

It is my pleasure to announce, at long last (and with some small
problems at first), the sucessfull two way gatewaying of the mailing
list (sca@ai.ai.mit.edu) and the newsgroup (alt.sca) {ta da}.

So... if your site recieves alt.sca, you can read and post to it
entirely (cutting down on incoming mail a lot), and if you don't get
alt.sca, now you do (effectively).

Thanks to Danulf for the mailing list, whoever started alt.sca (I
don't know, off hand), Mr. Bob Sutterfield for helping set up the
gateway stuff, Mr. Eric Fair for writing the newsgate code in the
first place, and all of you gentles who got wierd messages from
Monday.

Unto Dafydd Bleiddan, and unto all others interested, 
From Arval Benicoeur, Brigantia Principal Herald, Greetings! 

My lord, you have come to the right place.  I'm from the East, but I
can give you a few pointers.  

First of all, you should contact heralds in your area to introduce
yourself, find out what regular meetings are going on, find out what
sorts of interesting books are available to borrow & read, and so on.
A good way to do this is to walk up to the list herald at any fighting
event and offer to help herald the lists.  Don't worry if you've never
done it before: you'll get a few quick pointers, make a few
unimportant mistakes, and catch on to the idea by the time the
afternoon is over.  And you'll have made a good friend.

You should try to contact Master Allyn o Dubhdha, in Storvik, who
just finished a term as Atlantia's Principal Herald, and now has lots
of time on his hands for teaching.  He would love to hear from someone
interested in learning, and is a fine teacher.  He also has a library
of heraldic texts I would happily kill to own.  If you have
transportation, you can easily drop by his place from time to time to
talk heraldry...I believe he holds regular heraldic research meetings.

On your own, you can get hold of some basic books & read up on
heraldry.  A few good ones are:

Shield & Crest, by Julian Franklyn

A Complete Guide to Heraldry, by A.C. Fox-Davies

An Encyclopedia of Heraldry, by A.C. Fox-Davies

These three books are basic introductions to mundane (English)
heraldry, and are good ways to learn basic things like colors,
charges, blazoning, and the like.  The first one on the list is my
favorite, because it is readable & contains 400+ pictures, some in
color, and each one is blazoned.  Unfortunately, it is often difficult
to find.  Check the university library.

For material on SCA heraldry, a good start is Compleat Anachronist
#22, Heraldry, by myself and Marten Broeker.  It discusses how to
design armory, and assumes a familiarity with mundane heraldic
terminology.  It is available from the Society Stock Clerk for $2.00.

Have fun & keep in touch.  Your servant,

		Arval Brigantia.

>Thank you for allowing me to bend your ear.  We now return you

Remember back in the old days -- a week or two ago! -- when this list was
deluged by comments about dancing?  And we started to hear rumblings of "I
thought this was the SCA distribution list, not sca.dance"?

Those rumblings did not, by and large, come from people who have had much
experience with other newsgroups and distribution lists.  Each such group has
to evolve its own norms and standards, but some things are fairly common from
group to group:  One of these is the way topics ebb and flow.  Dancing didn't
stay the topic of the day, and Paganism won't.

If you aren't interested in the topic which is currently swamping the list --
and there will often be one -- DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT IT.  It's not useful and
it's bad manners besides.  The volume is there because the interest is there.
Wait.  It'll pass soon enough.  (If the topics stay uninteresting, you're
probably subscribed to the wrong list.)  Alternatively, if there's something
you'd rather discuss, just do so.  Like-minded people will be happy to respond.
I'm not going to turn this message into a lecture on general netiquette; it's
obvious that most of the participants don't need it.  But for those few of you
who are relatively new to this sort of exchange -- if the topic doesn't
interest you stay out of it or change the subject.  But please don't send
messages of the form "I'm tired of this subject and wish you would stop".  It's
ill-mannered, somewhat akin to doing the same thing in person.  (Note:  If the
*tone* of the discussion becomes offensive it *is* appropriate to send the
offender mail directly, asking that it be changed.  Don't send the request to
the distribution list.)

I beg the pardon of the readers for going on at this length in a manner
analogous to the one I've been calling inappropriate.  As I said, if this group
continues to thrive it will develop its own standards -- but I expect it will
be more likely to thrive if we tend to stick to what other newsgroups have
taught us is pragmatic netiquette.

Subject: 'light lists' etc

I have only been fighting for a year and a half, so I haven't
personally seen the trends. My knight, Sir Eric Foxworthy, has been
fighting for over ten years, and sees this trend as a definite problem.
I weigh 120 pounds in street clothes.  I put my armor bag on a bathroom
scale and it weighed *50 pounds*.  I have gradually become accustomed
to this much weight, as I wear full plate armor circa 1400 in style.
Last weekend, I got KNOCKED ON MY *SS by a LEG BLOW.  I think the 
Viscount who threw this lightened up a bit afterward (on me), as the
blow that subsequently killed me was nowhere near that hard.  

Having talked to a couple of Western knights, we agree that the Chivalry
is going to have to police their own, as many, if not most, of the prime
offenders are already knights.  I personally have worked to develop a
reputation for counting light.  If enough others do so, we can 'shame'
many people into 'rolling back' the calibration standard to a point
where injury is a lesser worry.  I don't see how a separation effort
would get off the ground, unless it came from within the Chivalry. 
Any Knights listening out there?  What's it like in your kingdom?
I also feel under a stigma to not bitch a lot at getting hit too 
hard, for fear of not being taken seriously as a fighter.  You play 
the big boys' game on the big boys' turf, and don't ask for exemptions
because you're small, weak, or female.  I don't throw blows 'like a
girl' either, but there are two people I can think of off the top of my
head (make that three) that I *could never kill*.  I don't know as I am
capable of putting a big enough dent in these peoples' helms to get
through to them that a beginning fighter killed them.  Now, these real 
problem people are a tiny minority, but they are singlehandedly (well, 
very-few-handedly) raising the calibration standards to a ridiculous
degree.  The Chivalry needs to speak out to the fighters of the
kingdom, and to other members of the Chivalry.  That's what they're FOR.

The West just started requiring wrist protection (rigid material) on 
both wrists.  Let's jump on this problem Now.

Really on the subject of "rolling back time" for fighting --

Hmm. This is getting to be a popular idea. Patri and I have talked about this
several times. There are two ways to do this, which boil down to the same thing.
First, we could create a completely separate list, for "light fighting",
where the rules would be a bit different, and the custom would be a *lot*
different. Second, we could set up a sort of mini-society of fighters who
agree that, when fighting each other at least, they will use a lighter
calibration than is customary in the Society today. Either way, there would
be a much higher emphasis on chivalry in fighting.

There would be some problems, of course. Ideally, we would want to roll back
the armor requirements as well, and this might present legal problems. Having
the armor requirements this high at one point, can we safely "roll them
back"? At the least, *someone* would bring this argument up, valid or not.
Also, there's really no way to police this new list with rules. In other
words, how do you define "not fighting chivalrously enough"? Basically, it
would have to be policed by all of the members, and by an honor system 
even stronger than the one currently in effect in the Society.

Still and all, I think that it's a fine idea. I've never become a fighter
for several reasons, the main one being that I can't *move* in armor that
is safe in the current lists. Being primarily a dancer, I can't cope with
*that* much added weight and constriction. Rolling back the customs and
armor requirements might bring some people like me into the fray (and I
would really like to at least be *able*, on general principles). Putting
a stronger emphasis on chivalry and style could do nothing other than
reflect well on the Society.

*Are* there people out there who are interested in this idea? Are there
people with opinions about whether it is possible or not? Let's hear from
you -- I'm beginning to think that there is sufficient interest to get
something like this started.

                            -- Justin du Coeur



I think that this is an excellent idea.  It might even draw in persons
who are interested in fighting, but not interested in increased medical
bills (like myself).  

Now, it's hard to be chivalrous when you're surrounded by 500 maniacs
wielding the moral equivalent of baseball bats, but in single combat,
I believe that chivalry ought to be more important than brute force.
Eduardo and Justin's ideas are excellent ones.  I think that if more 
attention was paid to chivalry and the art of swordplay and less to 
how hard you can whack someone upside the head, many people might 
reconsider going into fighting.  I know I would.

No flames, please.  Yes, I realize that there is more to fighting than
how hard you can whack someone upside the head.  I have nothing against 
fighting in its current form for melee and group fights.  However, in 
single combat, it lacks something of the romanticism that I like to see 
within the SCA.

Reply-To: "WIZARD::RUSSELL" <russell%wizard.decnet@king.eng.umd.edu>

While the newsgroup is discussing how to encourage new members in
the SCA, perhaps someone would be kind enough to help me out.

First, allow me to introduce myself.  My name is Dafydd Bleiddan, 
son of a Welsh Shepherd who, after learning the basics of heraldry 
from my uncle, has set off to find my fortune in the real world. 

I have been a member for about three years now, but have never
really gotten involved.  This is primarily because I can't seem
to get my foot in the door, heraldry-wise.  The primary response
I seem to get is "Well, you should talk to so-and-so", who is
either impossible to get ahold of, or is too busy to help me.

I guess the $64,000 question is: How does one become a herald?
Do you just declare yourself a herald?  Do you find an existing
herald and apprentice yourself?  I obtained a copy of "A Manual
for Beginning Heralds" by Alexandre sur la Mer several years ago, 
and found it very interesting.  Unfortunately, it only discusses 
the functions of a herald and not how to get started.  (Speaking
of which, the Manual is an absolutely wonderful discussion of
basic information on Armoury, Court and Field Heraldry.  It is
dated 1984 -- does anyone know if it has been updated at all?)

Thank you for allowing me to bend your ear.  We now return you
to the regularly scheduled religious debate.

Greetings-

One of the main themes of the movie was what role money should play in
these people's lives.  They were charging spectators to be able to buy
hamburger.  The croud thought it was circus.  The participates thought
it was a way of life.  The 'rebel' group decided that it was an act and
that they would go for the big bucks Show Biz had to offer, and then
changed their minds.

I think that more than once all of us SCAdians have played the dancing
bear for "A Good Cause", be it public relations or recuiting.  The best
cause of all is to perserve a good dream.

All in all, I thought it was a good movie.

Subject: Pennsic archery, past and present
In-Reply-To: <May.16.21.54.44.1988.2188@zydeco.rutgers.edu>

Past:  Last summer, at Pennsic, I was able to get in two hours of practice each
morning.  For me this was the best part of archery there.  In Pittsburgh our
practices amount to an hour and a half once a week (we're trying to expand that
a bit during the summer, but the scheduling problems are formidable), and that
is barely enough to maintain one's skills, let alone improve them.  I realize
that better and more experienced archers are more likely to want interesting
new novelty shoots, but I'm not at that stage yet.

The main problem with the running of the lists last summer was the amount of
down-time:  For reasons which included occasional requisitions of half the
targets for other purposes, the amount of time spent retrieving and looking for
arrows, and lots more archers than shooting positions, far more time was spent
waiting than shooting.  Yet I'm told that last summer was considered a marvel
of efficiency and organization -- and I don't seriously doubt it.

Novelty shoots:  What this suggests to me is that the search for new novelty
shoots should take a back seat to the extremely difficult job of just keeping
the basics (practice time, Ikacs, the war points) running.  Not that they
should be scrapped, but that ambition should be checked by practicality:
archery at the war doesn't have much to work with in the way of resources.

This year's war point:  I've expressed my doubts as to the practicality of the
moving target, but people here that I've spoken to think that the problem with
it is not its technical practicality but its logistics.  They suggest that it
will involve even more overhead (nonshooting) time than the old speed shoot.
(Also, a number of people have suggested that it is likely to result in a lot
of broken arrows.)

I, Eduardo Bardi, having returned to the SCA in the last 2 months, having 
originally joined in 1978 and participating through about 1982, see some 
interesting changes since I last was in Carolingia.

MANY fewer of the "old guard" seem to come to dance practice regularly.  Yes,
I know. They know all the dances, or most of them anyway.  After 10-15 years
of going to dance practice, let someone else do it.  My professional career
involves much more of my time now.  And other reasons.  Nonetheless, I always
found that I learned the dances better as a novice, and enjoyed them more when
I could be in the company of experienced dancers.  Even now, I would enjoy
dance practice a lot more if more of the elders showed up.  There are lots of
other benefits other than dancing as well.  Interaction between old and new
becomes easier, people know each other better, it decreases factionism, one
has the opportunity to learn about manners, ettiquette, and flirting in an
informal setting.  It also helps set a good example for the younger groups.

On Fighting.  When I was a novice fighter, Baron Patri had just about totally 
stopped fighting.  Fighting styles were changing, he said.  People were 
hitting harder, more armor was needed (meaning that people were going to be 
hitting harder meaning more armor was going to be needed, ad infinitum), 
finesse was going out the window, there were many more swordjocks, and fewer 
gentlemen fighting strictly for the honor of a lady.  I agreed somewhat, but 
I enjoyed fighting, I only had to wear a helm (I think that I had the last 
double freon helm around these parts, and a good one it was too) a cup, knee 
and elbow pads, and some sort of kidney protection.  More armor was 
recommended, but not required.  I was a reasonably good fighter, too, and beat 
my share of knights up and down the East Kingdom and Atlantia.  I currently 
feel like Patri used to.  I have attended some fighting practices over the 
last years while I haven't been an active member, and I have talked to quite a 
number of people.  My developed opinion is that people are hitting WAY too
hard, armor requirements have gone through the roof correspondingly as people
get more and more likely to get really hurt, and the percentage of swordjocks
has gone up again.  If I begin fighting again, then I would be interested in
trying to start up a movement to roll fighting "back in time" so to speak.  I
would favor seeing a style that favored lighter "cleaner, more precise" blows,
less armor, and serious attention to the "finer details".   Having fighters
only able to participate in tournaments if they have the favor of a lady who
is attending the tournament, and giving prizes to the lady might be good ideas
as well. Perhaps a stronger reliance on "Ladies Champion Tournaments" would be 
a good idea.

	Well, I'll just sit here on this for now, wait for the hard rain to 
start falling :-), and save more writing till later.  

I will be very interested in what different kinds of responses might arise 
from this.

The only way to improve people's first experiences with the society is for
*everyone* to work at it. The problem, of course, is that the groups that
really care about new people aren't the problem; it's the groups that are
well set in their ways, who don't feel the need for new blood, who probably
scare off the largest fraction. All we can do is to remind them that new
blood is good for any group, and that, in the long run, the effort will pay
off.

Also, remember that there is an economy of scale involved here. Carolingia,
for instance, is large enough to have several fighters who care enough to
bring spare armor to fighting practice (there may even be loaner armor --
I'm not sure, not being a fighter). Likewise, there is Barony-owned fencing
gear for loans, and tons of spare garb, mostly in the hands to the burroughs
(the college groups, where it's needed most). A smaller, younger group is far
less likely to have the money to purchase group-owned stuff, and there will
be fewer cast-offs to loan to people. In that kind of a case, one is 
dependent on people loaning their personal gear, and this usually results
in a few people making *many* loans, resulting in the fast erosion of such
gear.

	Hello Flashy, long time no see.  I'm sorry to see that your problems
with the "old gang" in the Shadowlands persist to this day (Flashman first
voiced this gripe in my hearing almost two years ago.)  A few new suggestions:

	1 Talk discretely to the kingdom seneschal.  If Mistress Ariella is
still Kingdom Seneschal then you would get a favorable hearing, she
was very welcoming to newcomers when I knew her, and certainly if the
chapter as it exist in The Shadowlands is still as closed as they sound then
they are doing the Kingdom and the Society no good at all!  I few discrete
nudges from the kingdom level may help to break the icey shoulders of the
older crowd.  If not...
	2 Consider starting a college.  This *does* have some problems,
but if you can show that you have been trying to work with the other
chapter and not getting any responce, then this might be accepted at Kingdom
level.  It is *not* a preferable choice; factionalization is something that 
the SCA tries to discourage.  But if there are potential members out there
that the local chapter is incapable of reaching (or trying to  reach!) then
this is a last recourse.  

	While I was active in Ansteorra I always wondered why I didn't hear
more from College Station.  The explanation in the Steppes was that the 
Shire there was 'over shadowed' by the Baronies around it.  The problems
you've encountered seem a much more likely reason for the lack of growth that 
the area has shown.

	Getting a chapter started on a campus is not easy or an over night 
thing.  It's taken almost a year to get to the stages of presenting our 
petition to the Kingdom officers here, and that's with a friendly local
chapter!  But if you can get something going, the rewards in personal
satisfaction are worth it.

Reply-To: joshua@paul.rutgers.edu


Before any of you go out and buy this product, I would like to pass on
a review from Master Bruce Draconarius, Crescent Principal Herald of
Caid.  Not in his words, exactly, but the gist of it is that the
product is not really worth the purchase price.  It provides a library
of heraldic charges, many of which are of very poor quality
considering the power of the machine being used.  Most of the rest
seem to have been scanned straight out of Fox-Davies.  In addition,
the package contains some discussion & description of the use of
heraldry in general.  Most of this discussion is ENTIRELY
inappropriate in the context of the SCA, and much of it would be badly
misleading to the average SCAdian.  The product is aimed at the
genealogical crowd, the same people who respond to "Let Us Tell you
YOUR coat of arms" adds in magazines.  It does not attempt to discuss
period armory, and offers some rather poor advice.

In short, you could probably accomplish as much of SCA value with a
reducing phtotcopier & a pair of scissors.  

Note: I have not seen this package myself, but I have seen the review.
I would love to see the program...Can someone bring it to the Pennsic
War this year, or even better, to the Knowne World Heraldic Symposium in
Calontir this June?

Good gentles, it itruly saddens my heart to hear of people who have 
run across problems like this in getting involved with the SCA or any
aspect of it.  I know not who this particular person is, or what part
of the country he is from, but I hope he tries again.  Whoever you are,
if you live in or near the San Francisco Bay area, I can help.  Sir 
Hilary of Serendip brings loaner armor to Bart practice Tuesdays and
Thursdays, and there is an unarmored practice for those just getting
started, or who don't have a huge household to support them being held
in Mountain View on Wednesday nights.  Write to me for details at
  {sun, decwrl} ...!quintus!laurie.  Now, all you good folk in other
parts of the country, what can we do to see that this sort of thing
happens as little as possible?  (not just the fighting, of course)
This year's newbies could be fighters within a year; they will be Shire
and Baronial officers in two or three, when Old Established Shireperson
moves up to Kingdom office or gets their Pelican and retires.  I
remember clearly how I showed up to an event in a blue tunic with a
white sash, the pennons fluttering, Princess Genvieve's gorgeous
costume, the courtesy and noble bearing exuded by all around -- 
the general wonder of a newbie at an event.  Four years later I hold 
a principality office, I'm a squire, and on the Princess' Escort of the 
Mists, and I've made more good friends than I can count.  My life would
be so much poorer without this experience, and I am trying now to give
back to the Society some of the good I've recieved from it.  I live 
in a kingdom heavy with peers, and I've learned the value of the energy
and enthusiasm new blood brings to the group.  

So I'll ask both  sets: the newbies and the Established People,
How can we do better by those interested in the SCA?  How can we get
across the ideas of the medieval re-creation, the ideals of chivalry,
the learning and the teaching of others?  I go to as many demos as I
can.  Partly to show off pretty armor, partly to show that women can
and do fight in the current middle ages, partly to talk about things
other than fighting that the SCA does.  Other ideas, people?

I was asked to post this for a friend because for some reason he could not mail
to you.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good Night,
I thought I might post to this list because I have a problem. I am
enamored to everything that the Society for Creative Anachronism is
supposed to stand for. I am am not sure where I first encountered them
but I belive I was in Jr. High. When I finally entered college I was
able to join and I had a lot of fun. I never really felt like I was
really a part of the society because my persona was/is an ill defined
11th century (give or take a century) welsh rover by the name of Alyn
Grahme. I did not want to have to put up with the politics necessary top
try and find someone to teach me how to fight. Your typical dialogue
looked kind of like.

Me: Hi, I watch most of the people here wearing armour and hitting each other w
ith sticks, sounds like fun, how can I try it?
Old Establide Shireperson: Well, in the SCA you need to be armoured before we
re we can teach you anything.
Me: Ok where can I get some armour?
OES: Well we don't have any armour that will fit you so you will ahve to
make some.
Me: Ok, how do I do that ?
OEP: Find someone who A) Knows how B) Has the Equipment C) Has time to
show a Tyro D) Is willing to show a Tyro ...
ME: *gulp* Uh wow isn't that music great.

And it isn't quite that simple, the attitude you feel from people is

that "Well if I am going to take the trouble to teach you I expect your
vasselage" which may be period as hell it is not a whole lot of fun. I
understand fighting isn't everything but for a male it can be a large
part of what determines your status.
And Then there is politics.
Has the movement that started 22 years ago in berkely as a protest
against the present gone the way of peace, the brothership of man, and
most things that the sixties brought.?

Gentles,  

These are a few of my favorites:

DRAGON:  Any beast of burden powered by rotted DRAGON FLESH.  It must
have four or more feet, however.

WYVRN:	A more personal beast of burden which only has two feet and
often attracts the attention of the local sheriff.

ABACUS DEMONICUS: The magic scribe who rarely forgets ( but thats what
backups are for.)

BLACK MEAD:	Local for COKE CLASSIC.  Notice: at times the purchase
PEPSI will result in a page or the like having to take shanks mare
back to the market place to exchange it for the correct brew.

SLEEPLESS EXCHECQUER: An Automated Teller Machine.  

Yours in service to the SCA.

Gentles,

As at many PENSIC WARS past I expect to be spending a large amount of
my time marshalling at the archery butts.   I am interested in hearing
any comments you might have about the running of the lists for the
last two or three years.

This year I am fairly confident there will be a shorter walk to the
butts and we will be shooting away from camp.

Please think about any novelty shoots you would like to see this year
or added next year.  I am thinking about resuming the catapult contest.

I shall provide to anyone who replies and can identify himself at the
butts a bottle of something worth drinking.  This is a limited time
offer; however, act quickly.


Yours in service....

Reply-To: paul@tut.cis.ohio-state.edu

It is a REAL BAD IDEA to digest the SCA mailing list.  The new
newsgroup/mailinglist gateway won't cope well at all.  If the mailing
list is digiestified, then the gateway code has no way of telling
whether or not a message has allready been posted.  The result is that
a message is posted to alt.sca.  The gateway here at OSU sends it to
sca@ai.ai.mit.edu, where it is included in a digest.  When the digest
is sent out, the gateway code thinks that it is a new message, and
posts it to alt.sca, REPOSTING the original message.  Generally, a bad
idea all around.

So _please_ don't do this; a whole bunch of things will have to be set
up to cope with it properly...

Subject: Polling
Message-Id: <579885455/kee@NL.CS.CMU.EDU>

Well, since an answer to this one hasn't shown up in my mailer yet, I
guess I'll take a chance on duplicating other messages.  And I'll keep
it reasonably short, just in case.

Polling is the process whereby the Crown asks the advice of the members
of an Order, as to who should be admitted to that Order.  The Monarchs
send out a letter with the names of those gentles who have been
recommended to them as possible candidates for the Order.  (Anyone may
write to the Crown to recommend candidates.)  The Monarchs select those
gentles for which they wish to poll, and may add other names as they
see fit.  Basic information is provided about each candidate's 
accomplishments, along with the name of their home group, and sometimes
a pointer to a reliable person who is familiar with their work.  The
members of the Order vote on the candidates and send their votes and
comments to the Crown.

In the East, the following constraints apply.  I do not know how many
of these conditions are in effect in other Kingdoms:

Members of an Order have four options for casting their vote on each 
candidate:  Yes, No, Abstain or Wait.  They may also comment.

All those Orders which carry a Patent of Arms are polled for.  This
includes not only Laurel, Pelican and Chivalry but also patents for
Royal Peerages.

There are three Orders of High Merit, for fighting, service and arts &
sciences, which are polling orders.  Lady of the Rose is a polling
order.

Orders of Honor are not polling orders.  (These are lesser Kingdom
orders.  There are about four or five of them in the East.)

Candidates must be polled for before the Crown may induct them into the
Order in question.

The Crown is not required to abide by the advice of the Order.

Members of an Order who fail to return two polls in a row are dropped
from the active rolls of the Order, which only means that they won't
get another polling letter until they write and re-instate themselves.

Most Monarchs poll twice in their reign.  By law, they must poll at
least once.

Being now a member of two polling orders, in a huge kingdom, I find I
spend hours answering the letters.  Master Kobayashi, who introduced
himself here a few days ago, is a member of four polling orders (and if
the Queen's Order of Courtesy were still a polling order here, it would
be five) and he dreads the arrival of the postman when another poll is
due.  Members tend to call each other long distance to ask for more
information on candidates in far-away groups.  It's just plain work,
and one of the better arguments I can think of for keeping the size of
Kingdoms reasonably manageable.

So, which Kingdoms out there DON'T poll?  And is there anyplace besides
Atlantia where the Crown must abide by the wishes of the Order?

Subject: SCA: Paganism (Delete it now if your tired of the topic)


May God (or Goddess, depending), the Wise, the All-Encompassing, bless
you and grant you Peace.

I keep a Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary by my terminal, and in
response to a previous request, I looked up the entery on Paganism.

	pagan n [ME, fr. LL *paganus, fr. L, country dweller, fr.
        *pagus* country district; akin to L *pangere* to fix --- more
	at PACT] 1:  HEATHEN 1; *esp* : a follower of a polytheistic
	religion (as in ancient Rome)  2:  one who has little or no
	religion and who delights in sensual pleasures and matherial
	goods:  an irreligios or hedonistic person.

My definition of pagan tends towards No 1.  Although most neo-pagans I
have encountered worshiped the Goddess ( I like to think of the
Goddess as a female persona of God, which helps shock us out of our
sexual stereotypes of God;  actually I like to think of Allah, which
is God as an abstact principle rather than a persona, but I digress).
Anyway I thought this definition of paganism facinating.  It appears
that the pagans are saying (1) and the public are hearing (2); the
mind boggles.

On a historical note, and the SCA is after all a historical society, I
find it ironic that the Muslims, who were more fiercely monotheistic
than the Christians [the Muslims refered to the Christians as the
worshippers of the three Gods, not buying into the concept of the
Trinity], were refered to by the Christians as Payanim.  Ah, there
never has been any justice or understanding in this world, and perhaps
we must wait for the next.

Subj:	RE: "Neo-Pagans"

Part of the official definition of neo-paganism is that there is no official
definition :-)

I think of neo-paganism as being a nature-based (i.e. viewing man as an element
of nature, as opposed to the subduer thereof) individual-growth-based (tran-
scendentalist) religion.  It is an umbrella that covers a lot of people who
might identify themselves as witches (as in wise {wo}men), practicians of the
lighter traditions of the occult (i.e. not satanists, who are a christian-
reaction group, and not many of the academic schools of the occult such as
demonology and alchemy--if anyones freaking out, remember I'm distinguishing
a difference not a similarity, here).

We generally celebrate the turning of the year with the quarters (solstices/
equinoxes) and cross-quarters (dates about halfway in between the quarters,
since 3 months is too long to wait for a good feast day).  Some folk also
celebrate lunar holidays (new and full moons, et al).  If you look at the
catholic calendar, you will find that a lot of the major feast days were set
on dates approximating these, partially because of the Jewish calendar, and
partially because of the churches co-opting of the holidays of the religions
of the indiginous European population.

Although many neo-pagans claim linear descent from the pre-christian religions
of Europe, I think that this is probably a yearning about as successful as
the SCA's yearning to re-create midieval society (even just the good parts!:-).
There are similar groups in most religions who try to go back to the "roots"
of say, early christianity, or pre-diaspora judaism.

Neo-pagans are well documented in "Drawing Down the Moon" (1986?, Beacon Press,
by Margot Adler), and a good intro to pagan ritual might be "The Spiral
Dance" by Starhawk (sorry, don't remember publication info).

There is at least one national pagan organization associated with a fairly
well-known religious denomination (the Covenant of Unitarian Universalist
Pagans, or CUUPs), and a smattering of other organizations, but in general, 
the neo-pagan movement is highly unorganized, and seems to like it that way.

Personally, I think of us as a bunch of free-thinkers who believe in a kinship
with nature, believe in the personally transformative power of ritual, and
agree to disagree on the details.  Religion as an expression and wellspring
of art.

I can't stand the paganism list being digestified, and am seriously 
considering having my name removed from it.  You will also note that comments 
on paganism lately have fallen off very sharply.  Obviously other people feel 
the same way.

It is a real mess, and the overhead time that I (ME) have to go through to 
handle it goes way up, and I just don't have the time.

Subject: Politics in the SCA

Is there too much politicking in the Society? Sure -- any group of
this size is subject to the basic human love of power trips. More than
that, though, is the fact that it's simply easy for something to turn
into politics. An offhand comment that offends someone, an attempt to
start a friendly rivalry; these things and others can easily become
"politics" if we're not careful.

Really, the only way to deal with this is to refuse to participate in
the politics. We're all guilty of politicking, at least indirectly,
but we can work to lessen the burden. Before you take offense, try to
look at the other lord's (or lady's) point of view. If you are running
for a post, really try to look, objectively, at whether you would be
as good as the other person who wants it. And try to turn the other
cheek, no matter how much it burns the ego to do so. Only if we all
*try* to make things better can things actually *get* better. Politics
will always be with us, but we can make them less painful.

Nifty idea, but wrong, wrong, wrong! The news software won't like you AT ALL
if you do this.

The Keywords field is yours to use as you please, but From and Sender
(especially From!) should ALWAYS be a standard email address, in domain
form. Replies to articles are sent to the address given in the From line;
most mailers would be QUITE unhappy if asked to deliver a message to

	I was!  From AS 15 to AS 18, on an irregular basis.  I got
started around the same time as Sir Thorkel, who I understand is
back in the area after a few years in Meridies, and Duke Sir Inman.  
And a few other people too.  

	Evidently the politics in the Steppes have dampened out by now,
not that they were ever *that* bad (though I did know one person who 
dropped out due to them.  The politics can be avoided if you want to,
I know I avoided them.

	In general, do people think that there is too much politics in
the Society, or too little??

On the contrary, wagon or wain works well for a wagon, not for a smoke-snorting
contraption that moves without anything pulling it, and valet or butler works
well for a person who takes messages, not for a box which does so.

Terms like dragon and golem  are not used to turn our medieval recreation into
the creation of a fantasyland.  They are used in reference to inescapably
mundane aspects of life in the modern middle ages.  I don't think it detracts
from the magic to give the products of modern technology the sorts of names
that could indeed have arisen from the collision of such products with a
medieval world view.

My lords and ladies, Greeting!

	Lord Justin mentions that he heard a story similar to one related by
Lady Siobhan ni hEodhusa about Duke James told about Earl Aelfwine.
	I had the priveledge to hearing the Earl tell it at camp after the
woods battle at the first War the East won (Pensic X ?), and it goes like this:

	He was then but a "mere" knight, and had been turned loose in the woods
to do what he could. Sometime late in the battle he was behind enemy lines (his
battle garb is dark green and black) and was momentarily resting behind a tree
at the side of the road when he observed a score of Mid-Realmer Returning to
the front lines from the ressurection point. As they marched past, not worried
about attack, he fell into step behind the last man and walked with them for a
few steps. As there was then _no_ way to kill from behind he grabbed the last
man by the weapon shoulder, spun him around, and killed him square across the
face-plate with a basterd sword (one handed).
	After which he turned around and ran like hell back into the woods.

					Yours in Service,

					Diego Mundoz.

Greetings and Well met!

    As a departure from the (seemingly) endless debate over the 
religious intolerances of various folks (and to show any and all mundanes
who might be in earshot that a good number of the folk of the Society are
interested in things OTHER than politiking)...
       I have had some success in brewing (and drinking!) my own beers.
I am interested in hearing from any of you folks who have also tried your
hand at brewing. Most importantly, has anyone a nice bunch of recipes they
might be willing to swap?  I am interested in beers and meads, as my rig is
not really suited for wines.  I have some really nice stouts and ales, but
my experiences with meads has been limited (and produced a vile brew that
should have been used in the ballista at the Mist/Cynagua Cattle war for
burning pitch)  Furthermore, I have limited my endeavors to using malted
barleys, as malting raw grains seems a bit intimidating.  Are there any
period brewers/maltisters out there?  I would be indebted to you to learn
of your techniques.

Subject:  Cliqueishness

	Hello Flashy, long time no see.  I'm sorry to see that your problems
with the "old gang" in the Shadowlands persist to this day (Flashman first
voiced this gripe in my hearing almost two years ago.)  A few new suggestions:

	1 Talk discretely to the kingdom seneschal.  If Mistress Ariella is
still Kingdom Seneschal then you would get a favorable hearing, she
was very welcoming to newcomers when I knew her, and certainly if the
chapter as it exist in The Shadowlands is still as closed as they sound then
they are doing the Kingdom and the Society no good at all!  I few discrete
nudges from the kingdom level may help to break the icey shoulders of the
older crowd.  If not...
	2 Consider starting a college.  This *does* have some problems,
but if you can show that you have been trying to work with the other
chapter and not getting any responce, then this might be accepted at Kingdom
level.  It is *not* a preferable choice; factionalization is something that 
the SCA tries to discourage.  But if there are potential members out there
that the local chapter is incapable of reaching (or trying to  reach!) then
this is a last recourse.  

	While I was active in Ansteorra I always wondered why I didn't hear
more from College Station.  The explanation in the Steppes was that the 
Shire there was 'over shadowed' by the Baronies around it.  The problems
you've encountered seem a much more likely reason for the lack of growth that 
the area has shown.

	Getting a chapter started on a campus is not easy or an over night 
thing.  It's taken almost a year to get to the stages of presenting our 
petition to the Kingdom officers here, and that's with a friendly local
chapter!  But if you can get something going, the rewards in personal
satisfaction are worth it.

Subject: Knightriders

,
    Yes, Knightriders is definitely based on the SCA.  George Romero, who
    lives in the Pittsburgh area, wandered by Carnegie-Mellon while Crown
    Tourney was being held there, and thought it looked like fun. He just
    made a few little changes... 
    
    That crown was the one which Sir Gavin Kilkenny of Kilkarren won, in
    October AS XIV (6 months before I joined). Gavin II currently reigns 
    in the East.
    
    A few months after I joined, the sewing circle made a trip into the
    city, where a prop sale from the movie was being held.  I still use a
    number of the skirts, chemise shirts, and dresses I got there (movie
    costumes tend to be STURDY!).  It's fun to watch that movie and pick
    out the clothes I have! 
    
    Knightriders is about the conflicts which arise when Ideals are in
    conflict with realities.  I think there's some relevance to the SCA
    today.

Good Day,

For those of us who aren't in the know, religion-wise, would someone
be kind enough to define the term Pagan?  I have always interpreted
it as a Christian phrase meaning anyone who wasn't Christian.  Sort
of an "Us-Them" generalization.  "We're Christians, and you're Pagans.",
or "We're Muslims, and you're Infidels."  I am sure that these are
blatant generalizations, so no flaming please.  I'm just curious as
to the official definition, if one exists.  Thank you.

i seem to have sparked something here....
perhaps i need to clarify something about my comments
when i said that the pagans in that group seemed to be
useing the society as an excuse it was meant in 2 ways
1) as an excuse to keep non pagan's, christians out/under
the control of the pagans and
2) a way of justifying their group to the non-sca locals.
this is the more important one.  They were a group of
pagans in a small town, who couldn't admit to what
they were doing/what they believed in so they came into
and SCA group and used it as their 'cover'.

I personally have nothing against pagans...i myself
have some definate leanings in that direction.  All i'm saying is
that this group was in the sca to use it as a "cover" for their
beliefs.  That i don't believe is right.

Re: people uncomfortable wearing crosses: I haven't seen this in the West.

Re: how did it get this way: Well, let's see, the founders (in whose 
household I lived for a while) are all Pagans.  They set up the major
lists on Equinoxes and Beltaine and other Pagan holidays because at the
time there were no large sabbats or even large Pagan groups, and they just
had a sort of unconscious feeling that SOMETHING should go on around those
times.  That may have contributed...

Interesting note: up until just before the current holder of the office,
the Bards of the Mists were all Pagans.  The one just before this one
was a Christian, and nobody had any problem with her singing religious
songs (my only objection was that most of them were Trouvere period, and
the office is, after all, "Bard" of the Mists, not "Trouvere" of the 
Mists...).  I think it must depend on where you are.  I know that the
east coast mundania seems to have a greater preponderance of uppity
Pagans/Witches as well (at least, that I've seen in my few trips out there).
Religion just doesn't seem to be as much of an issue out here.  After all,
in the West POLITICS is the name of the game (and when the King is a dumb
stick jock, people aren't going to be too concerned with culture anyway.
Sound bitter?  Well, yes, I suppose that's why I'm only a fringe memeber

Subject: Re: Golem

The Golem of Prague is supposed to have been animated by "The High Rabbi
Loew", Judah Loew ben Bezalel, also called Yehuda ha-Ari (Judah the Lion,
since Loew means Lion) and "the Maharal" which tho' it sounds Indian is
an acronym (I can't remember what of -- the same way the Ba'al Shem Tov
was called the Besht and Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon was called "Rambam").
There's a great long entry on the Golem in THE BOOK OF JEWISH KNOWLEDGE,
that says:
	The golem (or homunculus) legend in Jewish myth-weaving
	is very old, references about it already being found in
	the literature of the Talmud which was created during
	the centuries following the final Dispersion, in 70 CE.

It also tells the story of the Golem of Prague (one of the stories, anyway).
Just to show how much the Kabalists love acronyms, the answer to Rabbi Loew's
prayer for help came in an alphabetical acronym: ATO BRA GOLEM DEVUK
HACHOMER V'TIGZAR ZEDIM CHEVEL TORFEH YISROEL (Create a golem out of clay
that will destroy all the enemies of Israel).

On the other hand, "Golem" as applied to an answering machine doesn't really
fit, since the Golem was supposed to have been mute...

Subject: Re:  SCA: Religion: An Islamic point of view

Salaam, friend Mussttapha.  May your God give you peace.

That was marvellously well said.  I find that much of neo-Paganism is, alas,
based on reactionary responses.  The prevailing society is discriminatory
against women, therefore the Goddess is pre-eminent to the point of
monotheism and discrimination in the opposite direction.  In many areas,
Pagans/Witches are subject to hostility; since some join the SCA as an 
escape from mundania, they may turn that hostility around.  I do sympathise
with Alfgar, since it is very difficult to be that liminal thing, a Christian
magician -- the Christians don't want him because he's a magician, and the
Pagans don't want him because he's a Christian.  A little more tolerance
all round would be the ideal, but alas, we are human.  I only recently
realised the extent of my own paranoia and insularity: I was talking to my
mother about the media's inflation of occult-related crime, prompted by
slanderous publications by the religious Right, and she said, "Look, kid, I
read all kinds of different news publications, and watch the television
news, and I can tell you, THERE IS NO MEDIA BLITZ.  We're not hearing about
it.  1000 policemen receiving a cult-crime newsletter published by 
fundamentalists is a drop in the bucket!"  And I like to think of myself as
being pretty rational!

So there we are.  I suspect that the unspoken (and sometimes spoken!) rule
against religious discussion in the SCA has done much to foster all this
misunderstanding.  Communication -- and NOT proselytising -- is the only
solution.

Blessed Be.

You may have noticed that your mailbox is full of mail from SCA.  With over
100 literate people subscribing to the list this is not surprising.

Well...  there is one possible solution to this.  "DIGESTifing"

What this is, is a method where I collect all the mail sent to sca@ai.ai.mit.edu
and send it out ONCE a day.  Now this process is still in experimental stages
at AI, but is presently working for a few other mailing lists.

Advantages: less mail, less strain on AI, less strain on networks

Disadvantages: presently we have a very "interactive" system where one can
	have "open" discussions on topics.  With Digestification, there will
	be a great deal of "repeated" comments and discussions would be
	harder due to response time (like talking to someone orbiting Saturn
	(of course somepeople are ALWAYS orbiting Saturn (pretty place to 
	orbit :-) :-))

Please respond DIRECTLY TO ME and I will post the results later this 
week.

Yours in Service

Actually, in period, "butler" had not at all the same meaning it has now.
It was a form of "bottler", and meant the fellow in charge of the wine
and beer (pouring it, that is, so he was (I think) distinct from the 
cellarer).

They've been using "privy" at the NorCal RenFaire for as long as I can

Subject: Knightriders

I was just reminded of this by the fact that it came up on the
rec.arts.movies newsgroup.

The movie, Knightriders, is on Cinemax this month. I *think* there is
still one more showing (at 2:30 in the morning, or some similarly
godforsaken hour). If you haven't seen it before, get someone to tape
it for you; it's worth it.

As I've heard it, the movie started out as being about the SCA (I've
heard that it is *very* loosely based on an Eastern Crown Tourney a 
number of years ago). Between trying to spice it up to improve sales,
and generally make it a bit more mythic, it comes out being pretty far
from the SCA in fact, but is still in the right ballpark in spirit.
It's a cross of the early SCA, Renaissance Fairs, a dash of Arthurian
legend, and motorcycles. At least, the plot is. But the main focus of
the story is the people in the (never named) group, and most of them
are the kind of people we all know from the Society. The conflict of the
movie comes from the way that their dreams of How Things Should Be
interact.

Anyone in the Society would probably enjoy this movie (at least, I've
never encountered one who doesn't, and I've shown it to dozens), so
long as you *don't* go in with the expectation that this is the SCA.
It isn't, but it's something that the SCA could almost have been, in
a different world.

(In case you hadn't guessed, this is one of my favorite movies -- The
Lion in Winter is the other, for very different reasons.)

Interesting. I've heard almost exactly the same story, except that it was
attributed to Earl Aelfwine, and (this being the East), he tapped each on
the shoulder before taking them out. ("(tap tap)" "Huh?" (*WHAP!*) "(tap tap)"
"Huh?" (*WHAP!*) etc.) I'd always taken the story as true, having heard it
a number of times. Now I wonder. Does anyone know whether one or both of
these stories is true? Or is this just an example of the folk process, in
action?

Remember, as I mentioned in my last message to you, that Middle Welsh
orthography is NOT reliable.  We are talking here about people just
beginning to write in their native language, using an alphabet (the
latin) that was completely inadequate to the task.  As simple a name
as "Gwen" could appear as Guen, Gven, Gwyn, Gwynn, Gvwynn, and any
number of permutations thereof, all of them pronounced differently in
modern Welsh, but all of them signifying the same name in Middle Welsh.

I recommend A GRAMMAR OF MIDDLE WELSH, by D. Simon Evans, published by
the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies (sorry, can't remember the date
offhand).  It will give you a very clear idea of just how confused those
poor early scribes were.

Just to clarify: STRIKING from behind is not permitted in the West any
more than elsewhere.  The method for killing from behind is to come up
behind your enemy, lay your sword gently across hir faceplate and say,
"You're dead, my lord/lady".  Needless to say, it's not done often due
to the inherent difficulty of sneaking up behind someone while wearing
full plate or chain, but there is at least one cute story of Duke James
taking out an entire line of the enemy by flanking them and then
wandering down behind the line saying, "You're dead, my lord.  You're

     First, allow me to introduce myself.  I am Catrin gan Mor Rhyd, a
Welsh woman from Cardiff in the early 1400's.  I am visiting the Barony of
Carolingia(where, in fact, I was introduced to the SCA a little less than two
years ago).  I am currently trying to gain much knowledge about mumming,
masqueing, medieval theatre.  In addition, I am Deputy Mistress of Lists for
the Barony (read-in charge of fencing lists).  The extent of my travels and
chances to meet others from far off lands has been limited by the short time
I have been in the Known World.  I am delighted at the chance to hear/read from
so many I would only meet rarely.

     Secondly, I would like to second Alycia's comments about the nicknames
for modern conveniences.  They are awfully cute, but perhaps a bit jarring in
an event setting.  The first time I heard someone ask for a ride in a dragon,
my reaction was that the only way this could ever be anatomically possible was

Subject: Answering Machines and other mundanities

    
    I have heard the term golem used for answering machines; I believe
    that this has the same problem as referring to cars as dragons.
    Yes, golems and dragons are medieval concepts, but I can't imagine
    that very many people would've referred to their wagon or horse
    as a dragon, or tell you to leave a message with their golem!  I've
    done it too, but I think it's part of what makes SCA events seem
    more like cocktail parties in garb than medieval tourneys or revels.
    
    Wagon or wain works well for a car; valet, manservant, or butler for 
    an answering machine.  For similar reasons, I prefer tax collector or
    check in table over troll (neither of these alternatives is great, but
    they're better than troll), and privy over porta-castle or shrine to
    St. John of the stagnant waters, both of which are rather tacky. 
    
    I'm not trying to be holier-than-anybody.  I've used the
    mundane/fantasy euphemisms for most of my 8 years in the SCA.  I'd
    like to see a friendly group effort to get away from them though,
    in the hope that we can recapture a bit of the magic that seems to
    be slipping away.

Subject: Re:  Religion & the Society

 In response to Justin's requests on whether specific incidents got people
touchy about religion: I don't know exactly what went on in the early West, but
I believe that some of the fanfaron about registering "magickal symbols" in
arms came because a very prominent neo-pagan calling himself "Gwydion Pendderwen"
was _objecting_ to it.
    As for the East, we had nastiness with a very conspicuous bunch of Satan-
ists (who have since grown out of it or dropped out) offended MZB and assoc-
iates (as far as I could see, just by being there), and nearly got us into
a religious war, with the assistance of the notorious Frederick the Silent's
meddling. Later on, when one of them got a notice (which in fact had nothing
specifically to do with the East at all) about irregularities (according to
the Corporate rules) in his appointment as Earl Marshal, he jumped to 
conclusions and started screaming "Religious persecution!", and others (who
were already determined to believe anything discreditable about "Dawest") be-
gan repeating it without one scintillum of evidence. Whew!
   Then there was the occasion when Sean Ruabarua celebrated the "sesquicenten-
nial" [sic] of Aquinas by re-proclaiming the Albigensian Crusade, and King
Angus unwisely jumped to grant it his patronage. There was a VERY heated ex-
change of correspondence, which included such remarks as "I find it difficult
to believe any protestations of 
religious tolerance from an Anglican."

Subject: Re:  Gwydion and other God's names

 It is true that some "divine" names were used for humans in period. However,
I and presumably other heralds have had to contend with people who invoke this
as an excuse for not checking or do-
ing research. Someone would point to,
say, "Diana" with "But OF COURSE they used gods' names", and insist that
therefore the name of any deity could be used without restriction. We don't
operate that way.
   There is also the "recognition" problem. Even if, for the sake of argument,
it could be shown that there was some man, somewhere, named Thor, the over-
whelming majority of members would associate the name with tehe God of Thunder.
Similarly, I understand this is the problem with "Gandalf". And I was repeated-
ly slapped down in my defense of "Bolingbroke" on the (apparent) ground that
even if it is a place name, "anybody" will identify it with Henry IV.

I believe the Prague Golem is indeed a period story.  I've generally
heard "golem" used in the SCA to refer to a computer (along with elfen
scribe and other terms).  The best I've heard for "answering machine"
is amanuensis, a great sounding word for dictation secretary.

I've heard them referred to as Golems.

Q:  Are Golems period?  The famous historical Golem was the Golem of Prague,
and I can't remember when that was, but I don't think it was that early.

Subject: Heraldry & religion
Reply-To: joshua@paul.rutgers.edu


Given that the rules of the lists specifically forbid any religious
display in the lists, the College of Arms is basically forced to take
a very conservative view of what is permitted in armory.  As someone
else pointed out, religious symbolism in heraldry is very much period
practice, and such things as crosses and the like are so common as to
be ignorable.  On the other hand, we will not register armory with a
crucifix, or the Hand of God, or any other excessively religious
display.

As far as the lady Sophia's question about the use of "fidelis", that
doesn't present a problem since period style heraldry did not use
wording or other such abstract symbols (i.e., numbers, astrological
symbols, etc), so we don't register that at all.

Personally, I think the SCA devoid of religion would be a poorer
place.  I am not religious in any regard myself, but I see religion,
properly and tastefully used, as an important element of medieval
life.  I am one of the great proponents of the veneration of St Pyr
(Drink deeply to St Pyr!) in and around Rusted Woodlands, and I
delight in such things as...

-- Duke Cariadoc's use of proper Islamic greetings.

-- Master Vasili's annual Old Church Slavonic mass at the War

-- The annual pagan circle at the War

In short, I like any persona done well.  As Lady Deonora pointed out
so well, the key is tolerance and forbearance.

Greetings Gentles All!
I am Master Kobayashi Yutaka, Seneschal of Carolingia, holder of many awards,
fighter, singer, instrumentalist, and avid tester for the Cook's Guild, in
no particular order.  :-)  My interests currently are mainly administrative
and political, as befits the Seneschal of the Barony that Many People Worry
About.  My persona, such as it is, is a ronin of twelfth-century Japan, a
time of much upheaval.

I joined the SCA in college some twelve years ago, back before Atlantia.  At
the time i enjoyed hitting people over the head with sticks, and gradually
progressed to the point where i now arrange things so that others can.  (If
that is indeed progress :-)  The SCA has changed a *lot* in that time, and
will have to change a great deal more, in my opinion, in the years to come.

In way of warning, those who know me know that i am somewhat whimsical at
times.  I enjoy arguing, and i often don't care which side i'm on, or whether
i switch in the middle.  I believe the technical term is "chaotic neutral".
:-)  So PLEASE don't take anything i say personally.  I say things to further
a point in debate, or argue on an under-represented side, or just for the
heck of it.  Of course i know that we're all reasonable poeple and that i
didn't really need to say this, but one gets cautious as one grows Ancient
and Venerable.  (Well, Ancient anyway :-)

Enough.

In Service to the Society, i am,

Unto those gentles on this list does Lady Deonora Ridenow send greetings.

Good gentles:

In the Barony of Bhakail (mundanely, Philadelphia), the group to which I 
have belonged for most of my 7 years in the SCA, the incidences of 
pagan-Christian friction have waxed and waned, according to who the power
clicque is at the moment.  When I first joined, the group was mostly irreligious,
and jokes and various forms of period posturing about religion went on
freely with little or no malice and ill-will.  Then, we had a period where we
got a lot of active "Oo-Oo-Witches" (so-named because they had been known
to exclaim loudly and publicly, "Oo!  Oo!  I'm a witch!  You'd better watch
out or I'll cast a spell on you!".  The oo-oo's gave the authentic pagans a
bad name and were strongly resented both by the pagans and the Christians
(whose moral indignation knew no bounds).  Fortunately, the worst of
the offending oo-oo's moved FAR out barony, and the oo-oo household also
lost members and became less active, so it settled back down to quietude.

For the most part, no one will ever complain about comments or practices
religious unless they are made offensively OR are absolutely out of period.
I, for instance, autocrated an event that was on a religious theme, The Feast
of the Translation of the Holy Blessed Virgin Martyz St. Elena.  Now, St.
Elena was a local of surpassing skill as cook and needleworker, who had been
forced by mundane circumstances to move into no-man's land outside the barony's
borders.  It happend that our Chronicler, a good friend of this lady, was
given to writting whimsical pieces for the SALAMANDER about various people
in the barony and he postulated, in one issue, that Elena, having moved
away from all her friends and having a tendency to forget to eat for 2 or 3
days at a time, had probably forgotten to eat and was now dead, a martyr.
Well, this caught on, and soon people were referring to her as St. Elena and
attributing miracles to her.  A "cult" of St. Elena began to grow, complete
with hagiography.  I thought it would be lots of fun to do a St. Elena event,
complete with the saint herself, so I started doing some research.  It turned
out that in period, when a saint's relics were moved from one location to
another, the day was declared a feast day, called the Feast of the Translations
of St. _____.  So, I figured, we'd "translate" St. Elena's relics back to 
Bhakail.

The event included a solemn procession, headed by the Vicar of House
Ridgefield (in his ecclesiastical robes), followed by several of the
"relics" of the saint -- the holy, wonder-working egg whip, which had 
been known to beat the demons out of a curdled bernaise sauce, and the
miraculous lemon faucet, which, when stuck into a lemon, would cause
juice to flow unendingly.  And the, the incredibly life-life effigy of
the saint was carried in by 6 processing monks, all in black robes, singing
Gaudete with new words detailing the miracles of the saint's life.  The Vicar
then gave a brief sermon on the life of the saint, after which the 
incredibly life-lie effigy sprang up from it's resting place and a new
miracle was declared, after which we all went downstairs and ate an
enormous feast.

Now, only one (rather priggish) Christian was offended by the concept
of this event, and she stayed away.  Neither pagans or Christians in
attendence were offended by the whole idea, and everyone had a good time.

That's the way religion SHOULD be handled in the SCA -- without everyone
getting their nose out of joint as soon as somone of another persuasion
mentions their religious preferences.

Tolerance.  Tolerance is the key to courtesy on this subject within the
Society.

Deo

PS:  Mustapha -- I applaud your comments and we DO appreciate what you're
doing, persona-wise.  You are a shining example of what people CAN do

Subject: Religion and Courtesy


Good Gentles:
	I have listened with great interest to the converse on religion in our
society, and wish to address some of the issues raised, and one but little
seen.

	First: I am Diego Mundoz, was born in northern Castile in 1099, and
have for the last decade resided in the Eastern Barony of Carolingia. While 
back in Castile I lived at Court, waiting while my clain to the family holding
is resolved.

	When I was introduced to the customs of the society the concern for
religion part of my very first "novice lecture", and it was explained thus:
here and now, whatever our origins, we all start equal, and rise or stagnate by
our own efforts. To invoke a supernatural power to in any aspect retard the
efforts of another, on the field, in Court, or at any endeavor, would be a most
serious offense against Honor and Courtesy. There would be no offense in
wearing the accepted public symbol of one's faith, though if asked to do so on
the field it was to be removed or placed out of sight. The cross (and other
simialr symbols) were acceptable in heraldry (subject to period usage), as
they were to pervasive to ignore.
	This was not to discourage or malign the belief of the persona, or the
mundane person, but rather to kill at birth any potential for religious
conflict.

	The question at hand is how to reconcile this policy with those
personas for whom religion is an integral and visible part of daily life.
Religious tension of one kind or another touched the homeland of every Society
member at some time in period. Europeans, especially, have likely either
witnessed it or heard of it first-hand. Not to be aware to the issues, even if
you have no immediate difficulty, I hold betrays an ignorance of mediaval life.


	I perceive, unfortunately, very few solid options. I count myself one
of the fortunate. Back in Castile conditions were such that to whom one owed
service was much more important than to whom one prayed. I am told that this is
also the case in many of the lands far to the East. Theological differences are
dismissed in the face of something much more fun: politics!
	For the rest I know no simple answer, and seek counsel thereon. The
only general idea I have had: after a decade in this Barony I consider myself
both a resident and a guest. As a resident it is my right to believe as I
choose, though expression of thos beliefs may be limited. As a guest I am bound
not to cause unnecessary distress to other residents and guests, as certain
expressions of my faith surely might.

	I should like to engage in a discussion of this matter with concerned
gentles, with two goals. First, to more clearly understand the law and custom
of the Society, and second, to improve the instruction of novices.

						Yours in Service,

						Diego Mundoz,

Good Gentles:
 
The Publications office is in the process of writing a
publications policy for the Society, and has reached the point
where commentary from interested gentles is desirable.
 
The sections of the Policy regarding Kingdom Newsletters and
Local/Branch newsletters is ready for comment. If you are
interested in reading this document, please let me know.
 
Hard copy is available for a business size or 6x9" envelope SASE
with 65 cents postage on it.
 
Electronic copies are available on request: This file takes

Justin,

     This is not the United States of Anachronism.  If you do not
like a King who acts like a King, then fight in Crowns yourself, and
try to become a figurehead.  When I ruled the East, I was very much
restrained from ruling as I thought a Kingdom should be ruled -
restrained not by the beaurocracy, but by my desire to learn the
traditions of a new Kingdom.  My feeling on how a Kingdom should be
run, is by the King, with the help, but not the control, of the
beaurocracy.
    Yes, here in the East, things are different.  In the Kingdom
of the West, the King's Word is Law.  But no, things are really not
different, the responsibilities of the Throne are the same.

I'm curious:  do the heralds insist that no christian knights use the latin 
term fidelis ("faithful"--al ackbar, I believe, in arabic) in their heraldry?
My understanding of the mystical branches of Islam is that the names of Allah 
are honor titles which are also moslem virtues for the individual (to slur a 
distinction, for convenience's sake).

Please pardon my speaking out (I'm told I do so all too regularly...! :-), but 
I think that it may behoove the heralds to re-examine this.  Forgive me if I
overstep myself.  Arval?

Subject: RE: Religion and the Society

,
    Danulf, I understand your defensiveness (being mundanely Jewish, I was
    born with a persecution complex :-}), but I think you're overreacting.
    You don't push your religious views down anyone's throat, and you are
    tolerant of others', but unfortunately, not all Pagans are like that.
    Neither are all Christians, neither are all Muslims, neither are all
    Jews. I've heard the song "Christians roasting on an Open Fire", and 
    it is offensive.  A Christian protesting it would be accused of
    persecution, but I think it would be a case of reverse discrimination.
    As long as there are Pagans singing things like that, there will be 
    new enemies of Paganism.  Yes, there are some who don't need any
    provocation, but "fighting fire with fire" usually doesn't work. 
    
    Yes, Pagans are persecuted.  So are Jews, so are Muslims, and so 
    are various denominations of Christians, in places where other
    denominations are predominant.  I don't know what we in the Society 
    can do to reduce *all* prejudice within the SCA, but staying calm is 
    a good first step.

Subject: Archery at the War

I don't believe it will work.

The particularly incredible shoot is the moving-target shoot.  As I understand
it, the targets will be set upon wheeled platforms.  A long rope will connect
those platforms to a behind-the-line team (from the kingdom opposing the
current archers) who will pull the targets towards the line as quickly as
possible.  (The faster they pull the lower the score that the shooting archers
will get.)

Unless someone is planning to lay tracks, my imagination is not equal to
imagining practical (and affordable) targets which will not tip in the face of
such mistreatment.  (What might be more practical is for volunteers to *carry*
the targets.  To discourage the archers from accidentally hurting the
volunteers it could be ruled that no points will be awarded for pass-throughs.)
The 150- and 165-yard shoots are *practical*.  It's their desirability that
escapes me.  Remembering how my 25# bow reacted to the notion of shooting 100
yards last year, I expect the longer range to give me trouble -- but I may hit
it.  It's worth remembering that the majority of archers shooting the war point
are once-or-twice-a-year archers.  For them, this shoot will be no fun at all!
Sure, we'd like to encourage people to shoot more often.  And sure, we'd like
to reward those who *have* been practicing.  But having fun is part of the War
too.

Subject: Divine names & their use in the SCA
Reply-To: joshua@paul.rutgers.edu


Some divine names certainly became common human given names in period,
often by way of becoming Saint's names.  Examples of these include
Rhiannon, Brighid (Bridget), Myrddin, Aidan.  In general, however, the
association of devine names with the gods, or at least with evil and
un-Christian demons died very slowly, and the Church was in no hurry
to encourage people to use these names.  Rather, they encourage the
adoption of the pan-European name stock, mostly Roman derived & saint
names, or, as in ireland, spread the name stock of the conquering
Normans into new lands.

In fact, there is no evidence that Bran or Dylan was ever used as a
given name in period.  There is one reference that I know to a
"Dillon" in period Wales, but note that in Welsh that is a very
different-sounding name.  

Since many people in the Society take the things very seriously, as
recent discussions about paganism on this net will attest, and since
it is a general policy of the College of Arms that no name should
imply that the individual is of other than earthly human descent, the
policy on divine names is that they may be used only if specifically
shown to have been used in period.  This may be a touch
over-conservative, but it does strike a reasonable and objective
balance: if you can prove it was used in period, then it's OK;
otherwise, no.  The same standard would apply to names of dwarves or
giants from Welsh or Norse mythology, names of monsters and heros from
Greek mythology, and indeed to names taken from Tolkein and other
fantasy worlds.  As long as the bearer of the name is human, and the
individual in question is not so famous & unique as to present other
problems, the name should be accepted.

One last note: I don't know if the use of "Jesus" can be shown in
period.  I'd be interested to see a citation, though I'll be surprised
if one exists.

I am curious as to the point that the College makes.  While I can understand 
the argument for earlier personas, I would think that by later period 14th and 
15th century personas, the use of such names would have become acceptable, as 
due to the changing of religions after the dark ages, when "civilized" folk 
were good members of "The Church", and such names as Brigit, Bridgit, actually 
became people's names.  Some of these (like Thor or Lugh) obviously didn't
work that way, but Bran and Dylan and Brigit and a few others did.  I have 
also found (which are probably unacceptable) literary references to the 
custom of naming children as mortals after divine or semi-devine beings.  
There are plenty of people today in Hispanic cultural areas named Jesus, many 
of them either Catholic or Protestant, as well as Micheal, and other 
"archangels" names (which were definitely period names) as well.  Note that by 
the latter half of the middle ages, many of the "gods" had been converted to 
"saints" and this made it quite all right to name children after them.

I would be interested in more detail by the College, and other's comments.

May Allah, the Wise, the Light, grant you Peace.

I appologize for writing twice, but I realize that my last letter did
not incluce any mention of what to do when people do not act within
the unspoken agreement for religeous conduct in the SCA.  On this
matter, I can only remember as story that is told by the Sufi's on
this matter.

When the prophet 'Isa 'ibn Marriyam would walk with his disciples, he
would often be face with people who hated him for his religeon.  Full
of hatred and malice, these people would insult him, and call curses
down upon his head.  When ask by his disciples why he did not respond
in kind, 'Isa replied, "I cannot give of that which I do not have."

I will let you meditate on that story and draw your own conclusions.

There is still prejudice against Pagan in the SCA.

The extream reactions against any action that may slight paganism are based
from the belief that pagans are free from prosecution for their religous
beliefs within the society.  Any 
slight against their religous freedom and/or slander against their religous
beliefs in taken with shock.  This shock turns to anger...

Consider, your only "safe" place turns on you... how will you react.

TODAY... in the 20th century, pagans are openly prosecuted for their beliefs...
legally, socially, and financially pagans have been damaged by "public opinion".
That "public", in general, calls itself Christian.

The hostility between the mainstream judao-christians and pagans is beginning
to rear its ugly head in the SCA...

Stop pointing fingers folks... and just be friends...  we don't need anymore
crusades.

Subject: SCA: Religion: An Islamic point of view


May Allah, the Compasionate, the Wise, Guide you all to the right
path, and may the humble words of Mussttapha al-Muhaddith help you
gain that wisdom.

I find myself in the delacate position of walking the line of religeon in
the society all the time, and feel obliged to comment on it.  My persona is
an Islamic Sufi, and hence my period life would oblige me to pray five
times a day or more, and to make freqent references to Allah in my 
conversation.  Even though my personal religion is based on christianity 
(with a bit of Sufism and Zen thrown in for good measure), I feel comfortable
doing this, because I feel that I am educating people about the similarities
as well as differences of Islam and the other religeon, and that perhaps in
some small way, what I do promotes understanding.

On the other hand, using religeon in the society is always a delicate balance,
and it calls for good judgement.  I think it helps to keep in mind that the
primary purpose of the society is to be educational, and that anything that
is done at events, should have that spirit in mind.  It is important to
keep in mind that while it is acceptable for your persona, or you, to have
strong religeous feelings, it is not acceptable for you to impose them on
others.  This is a very 20th century standard, but it has helped keep
religeous struggles out of our national politics for the last 100 years, and
religeous persecution is one period phenomenon, which along with period hygene
practices, which we as a society should choose *not* to recreate.  
Thus I normally avoid the "correct" greeting of a Muslim to a 
unbeliever ("May Allah guide you to the right path") in favour of the more
courteous "May Allah give you Peace", which is correctly used only for
Mulsims.  (I use it in this letter as a sincere wish for wisdom for us all
in this most delicate matter.)

I myself have run afoul of the prohabition against religeous usages on the
field.  I had chosen for myself the frase "al-Ghalaba `ain al-Haqqi" 
(Victory from Truth)                                          -
as a motto, and had designed a lovely version of it to be placed on my 
buckler.  Persona reasons prohibit me from using most pictorial devices. I,
later discovered that al-Haqqi could also be translated as God (being one of
his nine and ninety most beautiful names), I have not had time to re-design
the caligraphy, or repaint my buckler.  I currently handle the problem by 
informing my opponent as to what is written on the buckler and asking his
permission to use it, before entering the lists with it.

I think the key to the situation is following your concience, and exercising
your tact.  The neo-pagan groups are subjected to considerable hostility and
paranoia outside the SCA, yet inside the SCA, where for the most part, we take
care to follow the guidelines I have discussed, they are free from those 
influences.  Thus they react more strongly when the freedom that they so
seldom get is threatened.  Of course, the answer is always that no amount
of rules or guidelines will take the place of common sense (a rare and
precious commodity).  I beg you all to remember that we are all brothers
and sisters in the Society, striving to recreate a common world, even if
we are not brothers and sisters in religeon.

May Allah, the Generous, the Merciful grant you all Peace.

Please send me that documentation.  The research of the College of

Mabinogion named "Gwyddon", and that name is acceptable, but it is not
the same name; the pronunciations are quite different.  In fact, in
this case, even if such documentation were offered, it might not
change the situation, since "Gwydion" is so important a deity as to
merit special consideration.  However, I would very much like to see
the documentation you mention, and I would love to have a copy of it

On the subject of religious unfreedom, I seem to recall hearing rumors of
things back in 78-81 about :
    A couple of "Pagan" covens deciding to wage magical war through the
lists, among the reactions to stop this included were no magical sigils on
shields or devices, and no one could claim magical powers, abilities, etc. at
any time. Soothsayer's are (as I understand it) to be known as semi-amusing
diviners, and people who are serious about magic whether it's Judeo-Christial
ritual magic, Taoist Sorcery, or Neopagan ritual should have the good graces
not to involve the society in it in any way, period or not.

    In other places (such as Windmaster's Hill), I have heard about
Christian groups doing ritual at events.  They were discrete enough to conduct
their business in a separate room, only making an announcement that those who
wished could attend.  They unfortunately also seemed to have an attitude that
nonChristians at events (or Christians who did not care to make anything of
it) were to be condenscended to, and gossiped about in ill fashion.  This
again was back in 80-81 or so.

People who may know more than I do of these instances and others should
comment, but these are among the primary justifications I have been given for
certain of the actions taken, and attitudes that have arisen.

    In a more general comment, I have often noted that the Society is
really divided amongst itself in regards to "things period".  We often choose
to ignore many large "period" topics or areas because we find it convenient to
do so (and thank goodness!), but will argue vehemently and with sometimes
great hostility when someone else finds something "nonperiod" to do because it
is convenient, or because a better way has been invented.  I suspect that very
few people would argue that armorers should either use iron, or build a forge
to do their work, but if someone who is fencing wants to use an orthopedic
grip on their weapon then this is "wrong!?".  Much of the current weapons
style when I was fighting rattan was taken from Kendo, Aikido, or other
oriental weapons forms.  This is likely not period to 12th century celts.  I
have always been of the opinion that if someone wants to do something in a
particular way (particularly if they have knowledge of the other ways and have
decided to do it that way), then it is not my place to tell them otherwise.
Comments?

Greetings,

The Western region of the East Kingdom is considering the issue of becoming
a Principality.  There is great debate going on as to whether this is a good
thing or not.  Unfortunately, it seems to me that we have more speculation
than hard evidence.  I'd like to run an unofficial poll.

These questions are addressed to people who have been in an area which became
a principality.  I would like to discourage folks who haven't had to live
through this (Principalitization?) from answering.  I'm looking for answers
which come from experience.


   1) Did the equity and distribution of awards improve, or decline?  I'm
      not interested in the number of awards, but rather if you think that
      the number of awards handed out got closer to the "right" number.

   2) Did the amount of paperwork and bureaucracy increase to the point
      of being a nuisance?

   3) Did having Royalty in your own back yard (or at least closer)
      make politics easier, or more unpleasant?

   4) Was having Royalty (and Court) at more nearby events prove satisfying
      or irritating.

   5) Was becoming a Principality a good thing for your group?

Additional comments are welcome.  Please send the results directly to me, or
post to the list if you're excited.  I'll summarize if there's enough
interest.

Subject: Religion & the Society

Regarding the comment made by Baron Alfgar:

I don't quite agree with your comments of paganism being the semi-official
religion of the Society. I don't think that the pagan community in the Society
gets any more religious freedom within the official confines of the SCA than
Christianity does; rather, I think it's just more conspicuous when Christianity
doesn't get it, because it violates more of the period atmosphere.

A question to those who have been around for a long time. How *did* the custom
get to the point it has? I can see that there is a need for some kind of checks;
an event that requires everyone to take part in a circle is guaranteed to
offend some people, just as an event requiring people to take place in a 
Christian mass would. *But* the entire subject has become almost unbelievably
touchy; it's gotten to the point where some people appear to feel uncomfortable
wearing their mundane crosses. It isn't that anyone is really enforcing
some sort of nasty rule, it's just that the customs of the Society seem to
be moving in the direction of, "just don't bring up the subject of religion".
Has it always been this way? Were there particular incidents that steered it
in this direction? It's *very* subtle, but there does seem to be something
there.

Subject: Re:  neo-pagans and the SCA

In response to this: it is my feeling that the neo-pagan construct is treated
as the "established religion" of the SCA. E.g, there have been formal invoc-
ations of pagan deities as part of an
event; but anything remotely Christian
gets shouted down with varying  degrees
of vehemence. I(For instance, I was
reprimanded for invoking the purely spoof "saint" Golias. And then there came
the edict that mass could not even be
listed in the War schedule, on the
excuse that this would give "the appearance of official sponsorship")
   Yes, I know what it says in the Corpora about religious freedom. This has
been turned diametrically on its head by insisting that it imposes a gag rule
_forbidding_ religious expression by members. Bad enough, but in practice I find Christianity to be the only religion
objected to. The College of Arms got
some particularly nasty forms of this
under Wilhelm, who ended up telling us that a) we can not use Christian 
symbolism because it would offend the
pagans; and b) we can not use pagan
symbolism because it would offend the pagans. That was not, repeat, NOT a typo.
   I also feel social pressure. "Christians roasting on an open fire..." is
and
the like are considered Good Clean Fun, but anything considered slighting by
neo-pagans is pounced on.
   One factor, in my judgement, is that the powers that be created a phony
issue by invoking "religion", when the real issue is _conscience_. As the
statute is framed in terms of "religion", that leaves a situation where people
feel free to do things which I find
far more offensive to conscience, be-
cause they are not labeled "religion".
    And before anyone starts jumping to conclusions, let me point out that
I am a practising soothsayer ("Seer" rank in the Guild, because the chivalry
gets antsy about anyone but Peers using the historical "master") and a magick-
ian in training, and could not care less about "imposing" religion on anyone.
However, I do not and never will accept that freely acknowledging _my_
religious identity, and expecting the same respect I allow to others, is
"imposition"

Subject: Newbie Situation, for both old and new

Greetings!

First, let me introduce myself.

My name is Tatyana d'Aquitaine and I attend college in Carolingia.
(Felding, mundanely: Wellesley College). I am a twelfth century merchant's 
daughter. My interests include dancing, mumming (acting) and fencing. 

Secondly, I would like to address the problem of the college student/newbie 
situation in Carolingia, and how to work around cliquishness.

I disagee with Justin's analysis of the newbie situation, but one must 
understand that we come from different viewpoints. Justin is a more-
established, mid-twenties type person, whereas I am a less-established
college student.

I believe that Carolingia is divided into two parts: the well-established
older members and the college students (primarily from 3 area colleges: 
Wellesley, Brandeis, and Harvard). Most of the new members to the SCA come
through the colleges, becoming more accepted after graduation if they stay
in the area. Very few people join through any other route.
This sets up a split in the barony between the "old guard" who all know
each other and the college students who all know each other. I think
that the "old guard" is a bit overwhelmed by all of the college students, 
especially with the influx at the beginning of the school year.
The main problem is a lack of communication between the two groups. 
Therefore, most of the college students hang around together feeling like
they don't belong to the group as a whole. The older members perhaps feel a 
little uneasy around all the college students.

Communication, I think, is the root of the problem. Perhaps this is what is 
occuring in other areas as well. 

To solve this situation and cliquishness in general, it is important to let
the people around you know that you are truly interested in the SCA.  Once you
seperate yourself from the general crowd by talking to the older members,
there is a greater level of communication, solving the problem of feeling
like you don't belong.
Therefore, I think that newish people should talk with others. Display your 
friendliness and encourage your friends to join with the same attitude.

I think that the more-established members should follow Lady Siobhan's advice
about remembering how you felt as a newbie.  Try to seek out new people and
introduce yourself!  Baron Patri du Chat Gris of Carolingia has adopted a 
policy of during court asking new members to stand up and he welcomes them.
This has worked very well.

Sorry if I have offended anyone with my ramblings,

Farewell,
Tatyana

PS. A fellow Felding has asked that I include these statements: 

1. The college group is an advantage to a new member because she is provided 
with a group of people like herself who are concerned about her. Perhaps this
is why people tend to stick to the SCA when in a borough (college group).

2. The communication problem is self-perpetuating because cliques form 
naturally among the college students because we live together and all know 
each other.

   By permission if His Grace Bishop Geoffrey, the Shire of Begental, Kingdom
of the East, does hereby invite all good people to the annual 'Bishop Geoffrey
Three-Fighter Team Melee Tornament.'  It is to be June 4th, A.S. XXIII.
   There will be prizes in the form of fine cloth to the winning team.  There
will also be a contest for the best team name, an open arts and sciences
competition, and a sanctioned archery shoot.  There will be lots of fun!
   This is a tourney with the theme of 'an army on the march.'  To this
end, we will be serving and eating outdoors.  Fine English court garb will
be admired but... everyone (except the Queen!) will be seated on hay bales
for dinner.
   Please see your Pikestaff for mundane reservation matters OR send me
mail.  We (myself and the other co-autocrat) are not holding to the sometime
theory of 'there is no such thing as an unpaid reservation.'
   A note:  the Chroniclers did not print our event notice exactly as
requested.  It was supposed to read  $7 until May 4th, $9 from May 4
through June 3rd and $11 at the door.  The Pikestaff doesn't say that.

[to all Chroniclers --- please don't be upset.  We understand.]

So, the $9 would be appreciated but Kingdom law says that what is printed
in Pikestaff stands.  We're told that June's Pikestaff will be correct.

   Please come play with us!

Reply-To: joshua@paul.rutgers.edu


I couldn't agree with you more.  One of the recent delightful
submissions which came through my office was the name change of "Alice
Gardener", spelled thus.  On the form, where it asks "Would you like
us to change the spelling of your name to get the meaning you want?",
Mistress Alys had written "Sure, go ahead.  I mean to vary the
spelling anyway."  And she does...

Spelling variation is a period phenomenon.  The use of different
nicknames or bynames at different times is, too, and the College of
Arms encourages gentles to so use their names in the period manner.
What I find objectionable is when someone submits a name, has it
returned as inappropriate for SCA use, and registers something else
"to placate the heralds", but goes right ahead using the name which he
was told would offend other members of the Society.  That is simply
rude, and it happens much too often.

Now, I will admit before any other that the College of Arms makes dumb
mistakes, and as I said before, we tend to err toward
over-cautiousness.  But in general, if a name or device is returned,
there is a good, valid reason for its return, based in the Rules for
Submission and ultimately in the definition of the SCA.

Veassellurds - look after big line.

Greetings good gentles -

  I am Brigid Cartiag, a person from Bergental with Celtic leanings.  I am
moderately new to the Society so I don't mind that my limited garb is of
the late-Friday-night-before-the-event style.
  My interests lie in fighting, dancing and autocrating (though not
necessarily in that order.)  I'm about to co-autocrat my first event -
the Bishop Geoffrey Tournament.  (Event announcement/commercial to follow
in a later mail message.)
  I live in a scadian household consisting of myself, Lord Giovanni Paulo
Sbragia di Lucca (the Leiutenant Commander in charge of training EK scouts)
and Lady Sendera of the Falconshield (Commander of the EK scouts).  So
if anyone has any scout-like messages to pass on, I'd be glad to.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Veassellurds:

Is to be called Brigid.

Hope to be qualified to tromp on northern Weasels by July.
Is good to be allied with Stonemarche.

an extension number, but the number I have doesn't have an extension,
so it is clearly out-of-date (ie, wrong).  Elizabeth Braidwood very
helpfully turned up the above information for me some time ago;
unfortunately, I seem to have lost the rest of what she sent me, so I
need to ask for help from the ever-helpful net.

Can someone help me track down a name, phone number, or some such?

Subject: underage fencers 


are banned from all East Kingdom activities...

this is a reaction to mundane liability laws... unfortunately.

As a fencing instructor, I know the value of starting fencers VERY YOUNG.  
European fencing "salle's" start children as young as four in simple foot-
work.

For SCA fencing... keeping youth out of the lists just limits a fairly easy
way to encourage this ageless sport in American Youth.

But, fencing is in its youth in the SCA.  It will take time for this sport to 
be properly understood within the Society.  Already it is internally torn 
on a simple matter of whether or not a mask-punch test should be made on all
fencing masks allowed in the lists...  Until the sport can be assured to be

Subject: Powers of the Crown
Message-Id: <579392370/kee@NL.CS.CMU.EDU>

I agree with Arval; the Eastern Crown really does have a fair amount of
power.  But then so do the other parts of the system, as he outlined
them.  I think Justin is right in implying that the system works even
when the King chooses not to do very much, but I have to disagree about
the "figurehead" business!  Arval and I are both Great Officers of the
East at this point (I having just been invested with Arts and Sciences)
and thus we are rather acutely aware of how much power the Crown can
wield.  

An interesting sidelight is that in the principality of Drachenwald, Curia
must actually APPROVE laws in order for them to take effect; this is
largely because with such a transient population, the stability
afforded by Curia must be emphasized.  But in the East as a whole, the
Crown only has to CONSULT Curia.   In Atlantia, which used to be a
principality of the East, the Polling Orders must APPROVE candidates before 
the Crown can bestow the Order in question.  In the East, the Crown
only has to CONSULT the Order.  As Arval pointed out, however, when the
Crown defies the wishes of an Order, the recipient of the award may
find that the disapproval of the other members weighs heavily upon him
or her.  Generally, there's an informal rule in the East that the Crown
may piss off one order per reign without tremendous adverse
consequences.  Some Monarchs just plow on through and do what they like
in that regard, and eventually the dust tends to settle and the new
members become accepted, except in some extreme cases.  (The Chivalry
seem to have particularly long memories, however.)

We don't bow or kneel to empty thrones, and even when I was a
Midrealmer, I found that to be too much for me to practice personally.

The degree of involvement of the King in the battles at Pennsic tends
to vary greatly with the ability of the King in question.  I think this
is as it should be.  We have a Crown-Appointed Warlord, and a wise King
will appoint a good strategist with whom he is comfortable, who also
has wide support in the Kingdom as a whole.  Sometimes the Warlord is
him/herself a past monarch, as in the case of Duke Siegfried.

Somehow I am not surprised that a view of the King as figurehead should
have come out of Carolingia (and this is NOT a dig at Carolingia; I like
the place a lot.)  Carolingia has a long tradition of independence, as
it were.  But I really have to disagree.  It's true that if the Crown
vanished tomorrow, Carolingia would go on as it always has (and so
would Debateable Lands, for that matter!), but on the larger scale of
the Kingdom as a whole, things would certainly change.

I really think that the tradition of a fair amount of independence for
local groups and territorial Barons is a positive thing in the East,
and makes us very strong in our diversity.  The Crown, ideally, is one
of the main things that draws us together and helps us retain some
common identity.  I guess sometimes this could look as though it were a
position which is just for show.  But I know from experience that this
is not really the case.  There is a level of activity at which the
Crown is quite important, including appointments for certain offices,
making members of Orders, and structuring Kingdom law.  Most such
things affect us all sooner (like changes to Law) or later (changing
the makeup of an Order in such as way as to gradually alter its character.)

There's no question that in the East we pay less attention to the
outward regalia than is done in many other Kingdoms.  This is gradually
changing.  However, we DO like the Monarchs to "be good in Court";
all the trappings in the world can't make up for an uninspiring
performance on the throne.  We can become very fond of those who do a
good job in this regard, to the point of ignoring their foibles in a
way that might have been quite unlikely during a previous reign.

I suspect that the sheer size of the East also has a lot to do with our
governing traditions.  Anybody care to discuss it?

I've gone on long enough!

Message-Id: <579388826/kee@NL.CS.CMU.EDU>

I think that sometimes using a different variant of one's name than
that passed by the heralds is justified.  (Note I said "sometimes".)
For instance, my own lord is registered as "Maghnus an Cnoic na n'Iora" 
(or something close to that.)  It means "Manos of the Hill of
Squirrels" in Irish Gaelic.  However, being an Irish name, its spelling
was not well-associated with the pronunciation, and for years he would
show up on polling letters only to draw dozens of abstentions because
nobody knew who that name belonged to.  (Eventually the story became
enough of a joke that people figured out whose name that was by hearing
the story told, and he now has two Kingdom orders. ;-)  Aside from being
hard to recognize, the name was awkward to pronounce and remember, and
on taking a couple of Irish dictionaries to it, we found that we
couldn't translate it to our satisfaction--but this would be
understandable if the heralds had rendered it in medieval Irish.
Meanwhile, every time my lord entered a list away from home, he would
have to listen very carefully to hear his name called, as nobody would
ever say it the same way twice.  But he likes "Manos", and the "Hill of
Squirrels" idea, so he never tried to change the name.

A couple of years ago, he made friends with a native speaker of Irish.
Eventually the SCA came up, and "Manos" asked for advice about his name.
The native speaker suggested "Manos de Cnoc an Iora" as the form which
sounded most natural to him.

Now, we don't know if the name which was actually passed was drawn from
medieval or modern Irish.  We do know that it was modified a fair
amount by the heralds, from the original submission.  Currently, with
the help of a friend in Atlantia who is doing research on early-period
Irish names, we are trying to establish what the early spelling for it
would have been (say, seventh century or so.)  Already it appears the
the spelling "Manos" is one of the preferred changes!  That would be a
nice thing to have happen.

Meanwhile, my lord uses the form "Magnus de Cnoc an Iora".  I don't
blame him.  It's not what the heralds passed, but it sure is easier to
pronounce and remember, and it means the same thing.  All his scrolls
and polling letters use the "official" version of the name, which
is fine with him.   I suppose we will have learned enough eventually to
re-submit the name in a documented early-period form.  (Anybody out there 
who does this kind of thing, by the way, is welcome to send me mail!)

As things stand, the modified version of the name, which he actually
uses, won't conflict with anyone else, because it is so close to the
orginal version.  And it isn't offensive.  And it is a name which might
have been used in period.  So, I don't see anything wrong with using it.

The reasons I have seen given for excluding underage fighters (and scouts,
and water bearers, believe it or not) is that they are unable to give 
legal consent to participate that will hold up if they are injured by
an adult.  The claim is that an adult fighting an underage novice would
be construeable as 'child abuse'.  This is rather an unfortunate ruling,
as it excludes people under 18 from scouting at Pennsic, an activity which
was specifically designed for them.

Clearly there are karate studios out there where adults train minors.  Does
anyone have any idea how they handle this?

There's a lot of evidence why it would be bad (if only in liability terms) for
minors to fight rattan, true, but what about other "combat-related" activites?
My understanding of the change in EK law is that ALL combat-related activites,
including scouting, water-bearing, combat field heraldry, and the like, are now
off-limits to minors.  Now, I may have misinterpreted this; if so, someone
official please feel free to correct me, because (as this stands) it seems to
take an awful lot of folks out of activities that really don't seem *that* much
more hazardous then many other SCA activities.  And what of fencing and
archery?  Are they covered under this ban too?  And if so, are we banning folks
from things they may be doing on their high school varsity teams?

{...an excuse for *what*? she ponders...}

Greetings, gentles--

	I'm rather new here, as I've mentioned in previous messages, but this
is the second time (once in person, once on the net) that I have heard that
neo-pagans are a "problem" in the SCA.  Is there something going on here that 
I should be worrying about?  Should I be staying in my broom closet around the 
society, or should I just behave like (I normally would, like) a civilized, 
polite human being?

	My immediate suspicion is that there are some adolescents (of whatever 
age) out there who are using the society to "act out," and some of them
identify themselves as pagans. 

	I'm neo-pagan, and I'm not trying to be defensive.  I *personally*
think that my religion has nothing to do with my activities in the SCA.  I'm 
just wondering if I'm likely to run into some history here that has nothing to 
do with me.

(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)
A DIFFERENT BUT RELATED ISSUE:

	I think that this is an interesting topic on a wider scope.  What is 
the place of religion in the SCA?  We are dealing with a variety of cultures 
in a variety of times with a variety of religions/philosophies of varying 
contextual importance.  Do people in the kingdoms *discuss* religion?  Is it 
taboo?  Are non-xians and/or non-judeo/xian/moslem persona considered abnormal 
because of the postulated religious issues?  Or is the whole business 
considered taboo/ignorable?

	I love to debate philosophy and religion, but I would not expect it to 
be proper to use the SCA as a context for proselytizing for any religion.  
However, I should expect that a midieval peasant mayday/beltane celebration 
would be as valid a re{-}creation of arts as a xian passion play cycle or any 
of the other arts that have historically drawn inspiration from the wellspring 
of religious feeling.

	Is it possible to re-create the arts of a period of history without 
re-creating the religion and philosophy?

Reply-To: joshua@paul.rutgers.edu


The following letter was part of a discussion of the return of a name
and device by Laurel a month ago.  The name submitted was "Jean
d'Eaux", the device "Argent, upon a tombstone sable, a fountain".  The
tombstone which was drawn in the typical "Boot-Hill" shape, a
rectangle with a half-circle on top.  Later research showed that this
shape of tombstone is probably not period.  No conflicts were found
for either name or device.  The submission was returned for reasons
which are given below.  With the submitter's permission, I am posting
this letter to the net to address certain issues of what the heralds
do, why we do it, and why we ought to do it.  Replies & discussion are
encouraged.  

	Your Servant,

		Arval, Brigantia.

=========================

I am happy to discuss the return of your name, but I must ask that you
not take any of these comments as personal attack.  Some of this
discussion is rather blunt, but is meant to explain, not to criticize.
Please forgive anything that may seem overly abrupt.

To expand: Your name was not really returned for any single reason;
rather, it was felt that the many different problems added up to
reason for return.  To list:

- the name is obviously intended as a joke.  It is generally the
policy of the College of Arms not to register joke names, because such
names are not consistent with period practice.  In this case
especially, it was felt that the joke was inappropriate because it
would be so instantly recognizable as such, and therefore that many
SCA members would find it inappropriate and disturbing.

- The name is not consistent with period French naming practice.  It
is grammatically incorrect, since the correct French for "of the
Waters" is "des Eaux".  The construction you use actually implies that
"Eaux" is a French placename, but that name is not properly
constructed for a French placename.

- Whether you recognized it or not, the name DOES have a scatalogical
reference which was immediately evident to nearly every herald outside
the East Kingdom who reviewed your submission.  Indeed, I happen to
know that several heralds in the College of Arms conducted straw polls
among their local groups, the result of which was strong evidence that
most SCAdians would consider the name inappropriate as a medieval
name.  When  combined with the visual effect of your device, the
scatalogical reference was deemed overly offensive.

- The name is so similar in pronuncation to "John Doe" as to be
indistinguishable by anyone who has not already seen the spelling.
SCA names are meant to be real names, names that could have existed in
our period.  Your name does not meet that standard in any regard.

A little general philosophy:

One of the jobs of the College of Arms is to prevent the use of names
which a significant proportion of the membership of the society would
find offensive.  This is not an easy task, and generally difficult to
decide.  Our approach is usually to err on the side of caution, and, I
am afraid to admit, on the side of paranoia.  It too often happens
that someone submits a name or device "to get one by the heralds"; one
begins to get a touch over-sensitive.  While I believe that you were
not trying to hide anything, and indeed, I said as much to the College
of Arms, the problems remain.

The definition of "offensive" is always somewhat nebulous, and rightly
so: things change, and we certainly don't want to be locked into any
one rigid set of specifications.  The flip side of this flexibility is
that there is often not a clear-cut case one way or the other.  In the
current case, I felt that "Jean d'Eaux" would be an acceptable, if
slightly silly name.  We have in the past accepted things like "Miles
Long", because although there is a joke in the name, it is also a
correctly formed period name.  In the current case, as explained
above, that last isn't true.

Names deemed offensive fall into several categories (my own analysis):

1) Names which disturb the atmosphere of the SCA: Names which, though
in period themselves, have such strong out-of-period references as to
offend many members.  Most joke names fall into this category: Jules
of the Nile, for example, is a really good period name.  We would not
register it.  "Jean d'Eaux" falls into this category, because although
the legal fiction John Doe is actually a period phenomenon, the
associations with that name for most people are decidedly modern.   One
of the reasons for the return of this name was the common euphemism
for porto-Johns, "Cathedrals of St. John of the Waters".  When
combined with the visual scatalogy of the device, this reference was
deemed offensive.

2) Names which imply non-human birth.  These are the most common cases
of offensiveness returns.  Probably because of the scarcity of
information about names in many early period cultures, many SCAdians
choose & try to register names of gods or other superhuman beings.  We
get more Myrddin's, Bran's, Dylan's, and Rhiannon's than all other
Welsh names combined.
   A divine or non-human name may only be used if there is reasonable
evidence for its use as a human name in period.  Thus, Myrddin,
Gwalchmai, Hercule, and the like are acceptable, though discouraged,
because they can be shown to have been used by people in period.  I
should point out that in the period when these beings were seen as
gods, NO ONE would have been so foolish as to name his child after a
god.  There is a limit, however, even on these names: there may be no
other reference to the super-human being in either name or device.
Thus, you can call yourself Myrddin the Fisherman, but you cannot call
yourself Myrrddin of the Flames or Myrddin ap Don.  Similarly,
Rhiannon ferch Rhys is an acceptable name, but Rhiannon Horsewoman is
not.  Other names, Grendel, Zeus, Odin, Gwydion, etc.  may never be
used in an SCA name, because they were used in period only for the
non-human in question.

3) Scatalogical, sexist, politically, or otherwise blatantly offensive
names:  Wilhelm Hitler, Peter Nunraper, George Ferret-flattener, for
example.  I don't think this needs any explanation.
4) Pretentious Names: No name should imply noble or other rank.  Thus,
given names such as "Earl", or "Rex" may not be used.  Similarly, no
Scottish surname of the form "<clan name> of <placename>" may be
registered if the actual clan had/has its seat at that place.  In
Scotland, a surname such as "MacLeod of Dunvegan" is in fact a legal
title reserved to the chieftain of the clan.  Another example: the
name of a significant place may not be combined with the given name of
any noble who ruled it.  Thus, although there may have been thousands
of John's living in London, the name "John of London" is not
acceptable, since that style was used by King John of England.  In
general, the name of any capital seat of a Duchy, Kingdom, County,
etc. should not be combined with the name of any noble who ruled
there.  Generally (although not always) the addition of a surname
unrelated to the ruling family is sufficient difference.  Thus, while
you could not call yourself William of Warwick, you could call
yourself William Fletcher of Warwick.  However, note that this is not
always sufficient: it depends on the importance of the individual with
whom the name conflicts.

There might be other categories that I've missed, but this covers the
most important ones.

On the question of how to revise your name for re-submission: My first
advice to you is to re-think why you chose the name, what you really
want a name to do for you, and what you really think the SCA is about.
Do you really want, someday, to be called into Court to be given your
peerage, and be announced to the world as "Sir John Doe"?  To put it
another way, do you really see your place in the Society as a joke?  I
apologize for the bluntness of these statements, but I really believe
that you are making a mistake, and doing a disservice to yourself that
you may long regret.  I urge you to think about this for a while
before you commit yourself one way or the other.

I should also point out that registering one name & using another is a
very bad idea.  First of all, it will cause you endless problems,
since on any official document (scrolls, for example), your official
name would be used.  You would also gain the dislike of many members
of the SCA (not just heralds, by the way).  In my own opinion, one
shared by many, such conduct is at best impolite, since it states that
you have deliberately chosen to ignore the rules of the Society, and
have chosen to offend members of the Society.  At worst, it is
dishonorable.  How would you feel if you were confronted by someone at
a feast who insisted on smoking in the Hall, drinking beer out of
aluminum cans, and wearing his Hawiian shorts, and when told that
this conduct was forbidden by Kingdom law and by the customs of the
Society, refused to change or leave?  The analogy may be overstated,
but the principal is the same.

Reply-To: joshua@paul.rutgers.edu


The development of clique in local branches is a probably faced by any
organization, and the SCA is no exception.  I think every large group
has had experiences with one or another circle of friends trying to
monopolize the running of the group.  For what its worth, the best
thing to do is keep on trying.  If you show that you have alot to
offer, that you will not give in to petty social politics, then you
will eventually be accepted.  Alternatively, you can always take upon
yourself the recruiting of new memebers.  Hold sewing workshops, or
heraldry classes, or fighting practices at your place, and invite the
whole shire.  

I've also found that when cliquishness sets in, the cliquers tend not
to travel alot.  The result is usually that most other groups forget
they exist, or at least don't care.  So, if you start travelling to
neighboring groups, and telling people who you are and where you're
from, you will immediately discover that they are quite happy to see
your group active again.  Once you make contacts outside your group,
you'll be surprised how quickly you become invaluable to your own
group.

I think you are over-stating the restrictions on the Crown here in the
East.  Indeed. in law, the King of the East has much less power than,
for example, the King of the West.  However, remember how short the
Eastern book of law is.  Most of the "law" of the East isn't even
written down...it exists only as custom.  (This, by the way, I
consider to be both vert period & very beneficial)  A recent incident
may make the point: Hanno ruled as King of the East several years ago,
and as King of Caid last year.  In Caid, the King's word is law.
However, it was his strong impression that he had much more real power
in the East, because if Caidans didn't like what he decreed, they just
ignore it and him.  (No offense intended to Caid)

The balance of power in the East is an interesting one.  The Crown is
restricted in certain important ways: no law may be made without
consulting Curia, and the high awards (peerages & kingdom orders of
merit) may not be given without consulting the order.  Note the use of
the word "consult".  After holding Curia or writing to the Orders, the
King may freely ignore their advice.  He doesn't even have to read the
responses to His polling letters; he just has to ask for them.  The
result of this structure is an interesting three-way balance of power:
The Crown, the Officers of States, and the Great Orders of the
Kingdom.  On one hand, only the Crown may decree any law or present
any award.  The other bodies have only advisory power in these
regards.  However, the Crown passes on in six months.  Officers sit
for two years or more, and generally have influence on the choice of
thier successors.  Polling Orders are forever.  A King who acts
without the consent of the Orders, or against the strong wishes of His
officers is going to be in for deep grief thereafter.  A typical
example, stripped of names: a King of the East knighted a lord against
the strong wishes of the Chivalry.  The results has been that he and
his squires have effectively been ostracized by the Chivalry.  Such
incidents are usually unpleasant, and so unfortunate.  A wise King
avoids them.

I'll admit that when laid out this way, it all looks rather nebulous
and seriously catty.  In practice though, it works remarkably well.

Among other points presented at Curia in favor of the underage fighter
ban was from Lord Friedrich av Knusslig Hamn.  Friedrich is mundanely
a school teacher.  In New York, if he sees a child who appears to have
been abused, and does not report it, then he can lose his teaching
certification.  This does NOT just apply to his students; it is a
general rule.

Recent court decisions make it very clear that allowing minor to
participate in combat is courting disaster: in most states, ANYONE can
file suit on behalf of an injured minor, and the parent's waiver is
irrelevent.  Parental permission does not exist in Pennsylvania:
temporary guardianship is not recognized by PA state courts.  If a
minor is injured, he may sue years later on his own behalf.  One such
suit could easily destroy the SCA.  

In the final analysis, it just isn't worth the risk.  Everyone agrees
that it is unfortunate that many valuable SCAdians suffer from this
rule, and no one likes the paperwork & hassle, but there just isn't
anything we can do about it.  We don't make the rules; the courts do.

Which isn't the same thing as saying that it is beyond discussion, or even that
it was well-considered.  The prohibition, for example, extends to scouting --
although scouting was developed, in part, as an activity for minors.

The mundane legal situation is cloudy.  My understanding is that in New York,
for example, if someone under eighteen is hurt by someone over eighteen, the
fact that it was all in fun and that it was an accident and that, anyway, the
minor signed a waver and had a note from his mother carries very little weight
in court.  In Pennsylvania the law is much fuzzier:  the impression I got was
that the only way to really find out is to get sued and see what happens.

There's a certain logic to not taking chances with the well-being of minors.
There's also a certain logic in not taking chances with the legal exposure of
the society.  It is, however, possible to carry the latter goal to extremes.  I
have been in the SCA for less than two years, and I feel safe in saying that
the amount of paperwork which the society demands from individuals and groups
(I didn't have exposure to the higher levels of the bureaucracy) has more than
doubled in that time.

Of course, this screws the east kingdom over for the woods battle
in terms of scouts.  We have a fair number of scouts in the 15-17
age group, that can no longer scout, because of the new law.
I've spent the last year trying to recruit more of the local college
aged people into scouting, and have been moderately successful, but
we still don't replace some of the enthusiastic youths that we 
aren't allowed to use...  *sigh*

By East Kingdom Law as decreed by Morgan II and approved by Curia, no one
under the age of eighteen may participate in any SCA combat-related
activity.  Period.  This includes practices, scouting, and any other
list-related activity.  This policy change was prompted by prolonged
burbling and delay by the BoD, and by the state of mundane law.

I'm afraid that ruling is absolute.

.   Kyla,
 
    It's sad that you and interested friends have been turned off to the SCA 
    by "evil politics" and unfriendly members.  Any social group will have 
    its misfits and grating members; the SCA is no exception (I'm sure there 
    are people who think I'm one of them!).  Keep in mind that sometimes 
    you'll hear negative reports from those who were burned, who may be 
    overreacting.  Give it a chance, and make your own judgments.
 
    Groups which are hostile to students are another phenomenon which I 
    don't understand, in spite of some first-hand experience with them.  
    There's not much you can do, except to graduate!  You could start a 
    canton on campus, but it's very difficult to keep such a group viable.  
    In any large group, though, there's likely to be someone who shares your 
    view.  Seek them out, and recruit them to champion your cause.  When the 
    local group sees that college students can be a source of free meeting 
    rooms and lots of energy for whatever needs to be done at events, they 
    may be swayed.  Stonemarche's has only recently begun to do serious 
    cultivation of the colleges in the state (neither of which is located 
    anywhere near to an SCA population center), and I think it will help 
    keep the Barony healthy.
 
> I have since been adopted by a person in the Disputed Lands (Pitt) 
    Do you mean the Debatable Lands?  Pittsburgh Pa is the Barony Marche 
    of the Debatable Lands (a good example of a symbiotic relationship 
    between barony and college groups, ambivalence of some individuals 
    notwithstanding).
 
    Good luck!

Subject: Bringing in the next generation

I hadn't realized that the problem of driving off new people was so common.
Basically, the only thing that can be done about it is for *you* to try to
change it. The problem hasn't been too bad in Carolingia, because there are
a *lot* of different groups that one can get involved in, and few of them
are cliques. But the smaller the group, the more acute the problem can 
become. And even in a fairly open group, it's easy for a new person to
feel lost. Even if no one is being conciously cliquish, it can appear that
way from the outside if people aren't actively *trying* to approach the
new people. This applies to experienced SCAdians from outside, every bit
as much as novices.

If you really care about the situation, work at it. When you see someone
looking lost at an event, talk to them and help them out. If you *really*
feel strongly about it, volunteer for the local "out-reach" post (the post's
name varies a fair amount). But don't expect it to be easy; the "out-reach"
post is one of the very hardest, particularly if the local group doesn't
support you. It's one of those cases where the job is its own reward.

And remember one painful fact of life; some people *like* to be in a clique,
and there isn't necessarily anything wrong with that. The way to deal with it
is to bring people into it yourself. It takes a fair amount of work, but it's
the only way to make it stop being a clique.

In response to a letter posted earlier, about problems in the SCA,
I have to agree with the poster (RML****@TAMVENUS).  When I first
got involved in the Society, it was in Concordia.  Everyone there
was very nice andhelpful to me.  Unfortunately, I discovered them
just before I left for college.  I did some checking when I got to
this city and found out the name of the group here, Delftwood.  I
was also warned off by many many people.  Seems that the Baron here
held complete and total sway over the group, and if you weren't in
his litttle clique of friends you might as well not bother.  People
who went up against him had their reputation seriously tarnished
if not ruined.  He has since lost a lot of power (the group more or
less split unofficially) but that reputation for the group remains.

The other problem I have noticed is with my best friends group,
(Northern March - mundanely Potsdam NY).  Her experience was
2 fold.  1) the group was run by locals who were extremely
hostile to students who wanted to get involved, ans 2) the group
was heavily over-run by neo-pagens useing the society as an excuse.

This worries me.  Concordia was wonderful to newcomers, but they seem
to be the exception.  I have since been adopted by a person in the
Disputed Lands (Pitt) as a daughter, but have not gotten seriously into
the Society to any degree because of all these bad experiences.  I
haven't let this stop me (because I know what a good group can be like)
But I fear that there are a lot of other potentially wonderful members
that have been driven off by things like this (I can count several here
in syraucse off the top of my head, includeing a BS in Medieval Studies)

Hello,
I just thought I would make a statement.
The SCA, at least in my area, is becoming un-fun. And it seems to be a general
thing in a lot of th areas I have seen, (3 different kingdoms and 4 states).
    I shall use my shire as a case in point just to give you an example of of
what I am talking about. I am attending a rather large university that is remote

from any major city. It is a rather small shire as this is a rather mundane
college. It is ruled by one group, a husband and wife and thier friends, and if
you were not a part of that clique you simply cannot get any where. And because
they are older than the average college student (they are in the late 20's
the average age of students at this university is 19) it is hard for anyone
entering this collage to really become a part of the group. As a matter of fact
this is the first university where most of the sca people were grad students
that I have ever seen.
   The society should be expanding, there is aan entire new generation out there

that the society is just not attracting, not because they are uninterested but
because the society acts as if they do not want them.

Subject: Publicity and the Board (national office)

Greetings, cousins.
 
I just spoke to Hilary (the Steward) and we cussed and discussed
this matter. I'm sending her a copy of what I sent you for her to
look at.
 
Her first response was: "Orlando was right, I really should have
had a chance to look it over, but if I were the public relations
officer for this group I would have felt comfortable sending it
out on my own, too." In other words, she's pretty comfortable
with my judgement but next time she and I should talk, first.
 
The commentary about the publicity and the board comes from a
letter that Mistress AElflaed sent out just before TYC. There had
appeared in Seventeen magazine a long article about the SCA,
which ended with a note that people could send in SASE's to the
registry and get info. The Registry was deluge with 3x5"
envelopes which were totally useless for sending out information
packets.
 
AElflaed sent out a letter which asked people to be careful about
checking with someone at the National level before giving
information that might have national scope. I'm amazed and
gratified that so many people here have internalized this advice:
it speaks well of the community feeling the SCA has today. Hilary
also was pleased that so many people wanted to be careful, and
sends you her thanks and commendations.
 
She recommended that some of you might want to read her article
in TI some time ago which was titled "So that's the way it works"
and discussed the differences between the Board and the National
office.
 
So. here's the upshot of all this. Let's let my statement stay
(unless someone has serious content questions...) until Hilary
has a chance to vet it and see if she wants to make revisions.
(And if someone asks, yes, someone from the national level did
send out this statement. There are *some* advantages to being the
National Director of Publications!) I'm willing to handle
feedback and questions from interested parties.
 
How's this sound to you?

Subject: Persona Trends
Reply-To: joshua@paul.rutgers.edu


Here in Settmour Swamp (Central NJ), the tendency is toward massive
numbers of Celts and, more recently, early Germans.  Unfortunately,
alot of those involved tend more to the gen-barb standard; the level
of authenticity is rather low.  Further afield, in my old stomping
grounds of Rusted Woodlands (Northern NJ), the big thing has been
Germans, usually late to middle period.  Since the level of research
there is rather high, the persona development is correspondingly good.
The current seneschal, Oswald von Grunwald, for example, rather prides
himself in palcing his garb within 20 years and a few hundred miles of
his persona's home.

Subject: The power of the royalty

Yes, the power of the royalty alters *radically* as you move East. The
King here is largely a figurehead, unless he actively decides otherwise.
The King must be, first and foremost, good in court; several, such as
Sebastian Nightwind and Siegfried, stand out as particularly good examples
of this. If the King is good at strategy (or thinks that he is), he will
usually direct the battles at Pennsic, but is generally not a spearhead
in the actual fighting.

The differences between the coasts were rather dramatically underlined
when Ronald, a former King of one of the West Coast Kingdoms, became
King of the East a few years ago. All told, he didn't do badly, but there
was a great deal of friction, as the King tried to assume functions that
are normally those of the bureaucracy, and simply assumed that he had
more power to order people about than an Eastern King normally does.
People dealt with it pretty well, but there was a definite feeling of
"things are back to normal" when he stepped down.

Subject: BOD & the press

Sorry, I had assumed that the BOD attitude towards press conferences
was well known, but it has been a while since they stated it. Basically,
around Pennsic time several years back, there was a write-up of the SCA
in column 4 of the Wall Street Journal (ie, on the front page). It was
a basically favorable ariticle, but the entire thing had been done without
the BOD's knowledge, and that made the Board *very* nervous. Thus, they
set down an official policy that, before speaking to the press (at least,
on a national level), you should check with higher-ups. Thus, if the
Barony of Carolingia wanted to go on national TV for a blurb, they would
check with the Seneschal of the East, who would clear it with the
Steward. This isn't really to prevent people from saying things in public,
it's just so the BOD has some idea of what's going on.

This is only for fairly large-scale press, mind. No one cares about article
in college newspapers, or even medium-sized local papers. Just give some
warning before doing anything big.

A Guild of Storytellers?  What an interesting idea!  I'm fancy myself
a bit of a storyteller myself: among the SCAdians I respect most are
Master Igor Bear, Duke Cariadoc, and Akira Sir Ogami, three of the
finest storytellers I've ever had the pelasure to meet.  I think such
a guild would be a wonderful thing, and could act as a repository for
the wonderful tales that should never be lost.  I'll join...

And a footnote: net noise it may be, but it's all white noise.  None

>Sea Wolf Scribe

	Well, no doubt some of the more experianced gentles of the
Middle will answer, but I can offer some insight.

	As an intro, I started in Ansteora, but was not able to attend
many events due to my mundane job.  So I'm vague about the Ansteoran 
customs in a lot of areas.  But when I moved to the Middle I noticed
a few things.

	In both Kingdoms it is acceptable to where weapons to court.
The Merridian events I've attended had the same ease.  However,
before approaching the Crown one is to remove said weapons, as only
a very few are permitted in the Royal Presence with arms.  When    
someone approaches the Crown with weapons the King's Champion interposes
his/herself and begins to draw steel.  On at least one occation the
Crown has interceded and granted the privledge of carrying arms, in the
others I have seen the Champion remained in position until the offender
removed the weapon(s) or the audience was over.

	There does seem to ne a custom in the Middle of bowing to vacant
thrones, but it is not one that is rigidly obeyed.  It may be a way to
tell who's been around a while.      

	Face thrusts are verboten in the Middle.  Speaking as an Ansteoran,
these people take thier blows too damn hard!  There is a real worry of 
neck injurys due to face thrusts, particularly from pole arms, that
has led to this ban.  In Ansteora (when last I fought there) and in Merridies
face thrusts are legal.  (Which leads to the interesting question: do you
take a face thrust from a foriegner?  I do, as I'm on the border an fight
in Merridies frequently.  If the Marshal doesn't intervien (as one should
if it was illegal) then I'll take the blow.  Others are of different mind.)

	Allowing face thrusts does have one advantage: in makes pass and 
bridge battles a lot shorter!  

	I was reading the West's armor guidelines last night.  I've heard
that the West takes its blows hard, and judging from the rules I saw in
the Page this is true.  Would those of you that have your Kingdom's
Heavy Weapons rules and guidelines online mail me a copy?  I'd be interested
in seeing the differences.

	The West appears to allow 'killing from behind', something that 
all of the Kingdom's I've fought in have banned. (Fouling if someone
does not acknowledge your presence is legal, but striking is not.)  
Ansteora flirted with lower leg blows (shins) but appears to have 
banned them, something that most other kingdoms have consistantly 
outlawed.

	One custom that the Middle has that still bothers me is that the
crown list is open to all the Chivalry, and any others by invitation only.
In the other kingdom's that I have seen, the list is open to any who can
show membership, with a few qualifications (In Ansteora you had to have
served as a local officer for some period of time, and at the Crown
Tourney the Crown assembled the Chivalry and asked if any would speak for
the non-belted fighters in the list.  This last seemed a formality at
the crown I was able to attend, are there any Ansteoran's on the list who
can tell me if this has ever prevented someone from the fighting for crown?)
I'm told that the Middle's custom is to prevent a pure sword-jock from
winning crown and then not being able to do the work, or else making a
shambles of the Kingdom.  It still seems a little harsh to me.  Politics
being what they are, I worry that someone might be excluded, though 
this could certainly come from ignorance as well as malice.

	I fear this is too long already, so I'll close now with one more
thing.  My last two postings to the list seemed to be doubled.  I'm
sorry for this, I'm trying to trace the problem.

Vale.

We also have a respectable number of "English" from 10th-12th C.  I say
"English" as some are saxons and some normans.  Does one count newish people
who haven't really built up a persona, but do have one set of their very own

  There are actually quite a few alternate personae japanese in the area--I can

Message-Id: <579301602/kee@NL.CS.CMU.EDU>

It's pretty much fine as is, and I guess it doesn't hurt to keep it on
the idealistic side--that's what we want to encourage.  

(As an aside, since it's really a whole 'nother can of worms, I'd like to
say that I don't normally think of the Chivalry in quite the way that the
letter presents them.  Maybe that's just my natural skepticism kicking
in.  I'm also not sure that the Laurels and Pelicans shouldn't get equal 
billing with the Chivalry.  There may be something magic in many people's 
eyes about the idea of a Knight, but the everyday magic that keeps the
SCA running, and doing real medieval things, deserves equal respect.
In fact I am a bit of a radical; I think it deserves equal *prestige*.
But I'll settle for respect.)

One small glitch--in the beginning of the part entitled
               How is the SCA Organized?
the first paragraph talks about the SCA, but the second jumps into a
description of feudal Europe, without indicating that the SCA context
has been left behind.  This is a little confusing, I think, when you
get down a few more paragraphs and read about how the SCA structure is
based on the feudal structure, but is not identical to it.

You might want to add a few non-professional mundane job
classifications to the list at the end--maybe Pittsburgh is kind of
unusual this way, but we have a number of housewives, some blue-collar
folks and retired people.  And of course, the ever-present students.

These are actually pretty minor points and I think the intro note is
quite good as it is.  (I do some editing and tech writing in my mundane
job, and the above suggestions are pretty much from that perspective.)

As a bureaucrat, I do wonder if perhaps someone in the hierarchy of the
Seneschalate/Steward ought to approve it before it's widely
distributed.  Just to cover all bases (and all rear ends.)  (Well, I'm
a Seneschale, but I was thinking of somebody on the Kingdom level, or
the Steward.)

Re: personae in the Debateable Lands:

We co-exist with Tuchux.  We are a pretty mixed gang of personae, but
one thing we don't tend to have is barbarians.  People who start out
that way usually go to the Chux.  (Note for those who haven't
encountered Tuchux:  they are a barbarian group loosely based on John
Norman's "Gor" books.  They range from the extremely obnoxious to the
extremely authentic, but perhaps tend more towards the former.  There are
many individual Chux who are quite talented folk.  We co-exist with them 
on a more or less even keel; some of them come to our events, some of us
go to theirs.  Their fighting conventions are like slightly sub-standard SCA
armor standards plus Markland-style rules.  They come to the Pennsic War
every year, where they drink and drum and delight in horrifying
late-period ladies. ;-)  It is NOT true that they jump out of trees in
the Woods Battle.  At least, not generally speaking.  But they do tend
to disregard steep slopes, treating them as opportunities for working up
vertical momentum, shall we say.)

Subject: SCA:Introduction, Persona, Storytelling, and Net-noise



May Allah, the All-Hearing, and All-wise, bless any and all who here
this message.

Topic: Introduction

Please allow me to introduce myself, my name is Mussttapha 'ibn
as-Saqaat al-Muhaddith (Mustapha, son of the water-carrier, the
storyteller).  I am a 7th century (A.H., 13th in your Frankish years)
Arab, who is currently living in Carrolingia.  My interests include
Storytelling, Fencing, Persona and all things Arabic, I am also starting on
some of the copious research necessary to becoming a Herald

I would like to take the liberty of addressing you on three topics, my
persona, storytelling, and the level of noise comming over the net.  I
will separate the three topics with lines, so that you can easily skip
the ones you wish to ignore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Topic: Persona


I would like to thank Justin de Cour for his summary of persona in our
Barony, however, he omitted me, which is just as well, as it will
allow me to make my own introduction.

I became interested in an Arabic persona through two sources, my
facination with the Dervishes (Sufi's) and their tales, and my
interest in the Tales of the Arabian Nights.  Thus I chose the name of
Mussttapha, and learned how to tie a turband on my head.

Carrolingia was good about accepting my "non-standard" persona, for
two reasons.  First, although Arabs where an exotic people to those living in
the middle ages, they were not entirely unknown; many Franj, through
the crusades had visited Syria, Persia, and Turkistan, while there
where some Arab traders in Spain, Sicilly and Italy.  Second, and
perhaps more importantly, Duke Carriadoc of the Bow was a friend and
frequent visitor to the Barony, and through people were already
familiar with the concepts and customs of an Islamic persona.  This of
course does not mention that both our Seneshal and our chief Chirogean
were already established as Oriental persona.

One thing I find interesting about being a "non-standard" persona is
the level of respect I get for relatively trivial matters.  For
example, simply saying "Peace be upon you", a simple translation of
Salaam, instead of "Greetings, milord" gets me credit for `doing'
persona.  The second address is of course perfectly proper for a Saxon
or Norman persona, yet because it is almost standard scadian, people
forget it is part of a proper persona.  

I can only encourage people to pay attention to proper persona,
espeically the ethnic differences which will make people notice where
you are from.  Saying "I'm an Arab" is not as much fun as wearing a
turband and saying "Salaam" and letting people figure out that you are
an Arab.  My best sources have been tales recorded in period (in
particular the Thousand Nights and a Night), espeically those with
good footnotes.  These have given me an indication of what people
thought was proper (if perhaps a bit florid for the tales) behavior of
the time.  At any rate it is these little things that help add to the
"suspension of disbelief" which allows the current middle ages to
become real.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Topic: Storytelling

As I mentioned before, I am interesting in both preserving the oral
tradition of generations past, and maintinging the oral tradition of
this our current generation.  That is in story telling.  Currently I
and many others (including Justin who has already introduced himself)
have created a storytelling practice group.  We are currently debating
the relative merits of becoming a Guild.  Perhaps I will have a chance
to discuss the matter at some length later.

As one of my purposes is to preserve stories of the current Middle
Ages, I would like to collect some of them over the net.  In order to
keep the net from being flooded with stories, please send them to me 
"almond@hustat.harvard.edu" I will collect them and post them to the
net about once a week (or less often if I get fewer submissions).  
I am also interested in sources for period stories, those you can
could either post directly to the net, or send to me, and I will post
an updated list.  If I collect enough stories, I will typeset them,
and distribute them (for copying cost) at the Pensic War, or over the
net by request.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Topic: Net Noise

I appologies for making more noise about net organisation, but it
seems to me to be important.  The trafic on the net is high, and
making it a news group will only help those who read the news (for
example I seem to have missed the letter to new members which was put
over the net, I would have liked to see it).  To help aid those of us
who must sort through much mail, I would like to provide the following
suggestion for how to deal with the mail.

The key is to use a good subject heading.  I suggest "SCA:" followed
by a list of one word descriptions describing topics in the letter,
for example:

  Introduction -- a persona introducing himself on the net
  Persona -- discussions about personas
  Heraldry, Dance, Storytelling, Fighting, Fencing -- these are pretty
self explanatory.

These are only matters of simple courtesy, because, for example, I
enjoy dancing, but would rather not need to read volumes of mail on
how various dances are done around the known world.  I would prefer to
instead take comfort in the fact that my dancemaster (Justin) is
reading them, and will digest and relate to me the results of his
research.  

The sinlge worst type of mail is mail about how to run the net,
comments about orginization are a nuisance at best (this one
included).  And letters telling Danulf he should not discontinue the
Mailing List (a idea I heartily agree with) should be sent to
"sca-request", and not the whole mailing list.  If you must bring up
these matters with the entire list, I would like to modestly suggest
the following topic name "Net Noise".

---------------------------------------------------

Thank you for listening to my humble suggestions and comments.
Inshallah, we shall enjoy profitable discourse over the ether.

Your Obedient Servant,

Subject: BoD & press
Reply-To: joshua@paul.rutgers.edu


Basically, the BoD wants to have some control (or at least
notification) about SCa members making statements to the press.  After
a few bad incidents with the SCA either accidentally or deliberately
getting bad press, they are a bit wary about the effects this may have
on our social & legal standing.  The group is big enough now that we
need to be careful about people bad mouthing us.  If one schmuck blabs
off to some gossip rag, and gives the impression that he is speaking
officially, we could be royally scrod in all sorts of ways.  So, the
BoD at least wants to know what we are doing officially.  Just to give
an example of one problem which did arise, a SCA member once wrote an
article for a teenage girls' magazine, on what it's like to be a
Princess.  She gave the BoD's address to contact for information, but
didn't mention that inquiries should include a full-sized SASE.  As a
result, the corporate office was deluged with tiny pink envelopes
requesting details, and feeling obliged to answer, they were put to a
rather large expense.  This was a minor problem, but it does
illustrate the value of a publicity corrdinator.

Subject: personae and introductory note

I'd been interested in the "personae makeup" of various kingdoms, and
in hopes of encouraging this, I'll put in a bit about the West.
There is a great variety in personae, and the less common, such as the
Oriental folk, are not discouraged.  I would say that the majority of
the West (guesstimate 60 to 70 percent) adopts a crusader persona, or 
at least dresses that way.  I know many people, however, that will 
see some neat fabric or trim and create a costume that is completely
different from what their 'persona' usually wears.  A strong trend of
late is toward Persian or middle eastern garb (it's very cool for 
summer tourneys), but many of these folk maintain European names.  

Another interesting geographical difference, that Lady Siobhann
mentioned in the Introductory note, is the way the monarchs are treated.
In the West Kingdom, it is commonly held that the King's word is law.
This means that the King (monarch, really, we just haven't had a woman 
win yet.  Underline yet, Sir Maythen is really getting back into it)
leads the army of the West in warfare, makes policy decisions for the
good of the Kingdom, and has the final say in what happens within the realm.
I am told by those who have been privileged to attend Pennsic that the 
Kings of lands to the east have a great courtly fuss made over them, and
the officers and such end up making the real decisions.  I'm not saying
this is bad, it's just an interesting difference in the way the SCA grew
on opposite coasts.  I'm interested in the small cultural differences
(and there are many) between different Kingdoms (such as the
acceptability of wearing weapons to court, bowing to thrones when
nobody is sitting there, thrusting to the face in battle. etc)

That introductory note was rather good.  It might be a good idea to run
it by the Steward, though.  I can print off a copy and show it to Hilary 
at Thursday Bartbash.   Good gentles, please forgive my undoubtedly
geocentric attitude; if I'd discovered the SCA in a different Kingdom,
I'd think that way was the best, too.  Please feel free to correct me 
on matters of the culture of other Kingdoms, as I really do want to
know.

Subject:      Moonshine
To:           Sca Discussion List <SCA@ai.ai.mit.edu>


   I'm posting this to the whole list because I took so long to do it that I
 want as many people as possible to benefit from it.  I hope none of you minds,
 and maybe you will even learn a new dance from it.

   Torvald asked me for the steps to Moonshine, and here they are:

    First, my appologies for responding so late.  I took a three-day weekend
 (Fri + Weekend) and came back to 85+ files in my reader, which took much time
 to go through between bouts of doing real work.
    Next, Moonshine.  It has its own music, and the titles I have seen it
 under are 'Svetit Luna' or 'Svetit Mesyats', and somehow translated as
 'Shining Moon'.  We called it Moonshine in Three Rivers because on the
 record we used then, there was an intro of a phrase in Russian (I presume)
 followed by a shout of 'Moonshine!' and the music would begin.  Some
 suggestions on tapes/records follow - I know that it is on at least two of
 the following, but not which two (I forgot to check at home).  Beyond these
 titles, check any Balalaika record, or Russian Folk record.
    Balalaika Melodies
    Folk Songs of Russia          both by the Balalaika Ensemble
    Play, My Balalaika            by The Andreyev Balalaika Ensemble
    The Workd of the Balalaika    by The osipov Balalaika Orchestra

  Now, the dance.  The hub of this dance, the reason I find it so much fun,
 is the spin.  You should find someone to practice it with before trying to
 teach anyone else how to do it.  I only hope I can convey the basics via
 phosphor as I have had so much trouble trying to do it in person.
  Basically, you have to imagine that you are spinning around a flagpole.
 This is the best analogy I can come up with - holding onto an upright pole
 of some kind with one hand and spinning yourself around it.  Only, in this
 dance, your partner is the pole, sort of.  Actually, when done right the
 partners balance each other and they can get up quite a bit of speed.  This
 is both the most fun part of the dance, and the hardest to do right,
 therefore the most 'dangerous'.

  The steps:
   Even though the music is in 4/4 time, the steps are in groups of 3, with
 the last beat sort of a rest.  As the music speeds up, this rest goes away.

  It can be broken up into 3 parts, the first two of which are identical.

  You begin facing your partner (this dance is not done in a line or circle
 or anything like that, but rather individual couples widely spaced about the
 dance floor) holding left hands with right arms crossed over the left and
 hanging a little limp.

  Part 1, Section 1 - Wave
    Measure 1 - Keeping hold of left hands, both partners will swing their
                 right hands out, turning their bodies a quarter turn, ending
                 up at the end in a line from right hand to right hand, facing
                 opposite directions.  In the early stages of the dance (i.e.
                 while it is slow), the feet will step in place, first right,
                 then left, then right, with the fourth beat having no motion.
                 (This is a very technical way of saying 'throw your right
                 arm behind you and take three steps in place while you do so')
    Measure 2 - Partners swing their right arms back in with a quarter turn
                 so that they end up back the way they started.  The feet do
                 three steps again, this time left, right, left. (Translation,
                 'throw your right arm back over your left taking three steps')
    Measure 3 - Same as Measure 1 (Throw right arm out)
    Measure 4 - Same as Measure 2 (Bring right arm back)
    Measure 5 - Begin same as Measure 1 and 3, except instead of just throwing
                 out the arm and stepping in place, now partners will release
                 their left hands and do a three step turn, first right, then
                 left, then right, ending up roughly facing their partner
                 across a bit of distance.  On the fourth beat of the measure,
                 clap once. (Translation, turn out and clap)
    Measure 6 - Reverse the previous measure, turning back in to partner in
                 three steps and clapping on the fourth beat. (Translation
                 un-needed)
  Part 1, Section 2 - the Spin.
    Measure 1-8 - Once the partners have clapped, they interlace arms and do
                 a forward spin for 8 measures.
                 First, the arm interlacing.  The couple stands right shoulder
                  to right shoulder, facing opposite ways.  Each puts their
                  left hand behind their back.  Each puts their right arm
                  between their partner's right arm and body (locking elbows,
                  kind of), and graps their partner's left hand.  With a good
                  strong grip, this is a very stable position.
                 Next, the spin.  When the music is slow, the best way to to
                  the spin is in groups of triple steps, starting right, left,
                  right, rest, and alternating.  But, the object (to me) of
                  this dance is the fast spin.  This will have to be practiced
                  accomplished properly - there is a tendency for one or the
                  other partner to lose balance.  Ideally, there are only two
                  motions to the fast spin per measure; one to move the inner
                  (right) foot about halfway around the center point, and the
                  other to pull the body in line with that foot, bringing the
                  outer (left) foot along.  I really cannot describe it any
                  better - you'll just have to practice it.  Believe me, it
                  is worth the effort when done right.
                 Final note - when doing the fast spin, it helps to look at a
                  stationary point while spinning, such as your partner's
                  shoulder or face.  This helps cut down on the dizzyness.
  Part 2, Section 1 - Wave
       As the partners finish spinning, they should slide apart, and turn
        their bodies to approximate the initial position of the dance.  Usually
        the first measure of this section is used to get to the position called
        for at the end of the measure (straight line from right hand to right
        hand, left hands clasped, facing opposite directions) in whatever steps
        work, leaving out the actual intermediate moves.
    Measure 1-6 - exactly the same as Part 1, Section 1
  Part 2, Section 2 - The Spin
    Measure 1-8 - exactly the same as Part 1, Section 2
  Part 3, Section 1 - Walkees!
    Measure 1-8 - instead of sliding apart, couples will modify their present
                 stance for this section.  Still right shoulder to right
                 shoulder, they un-link arms and cross right arms in front of
                 their partner, gripping respective left waists or hips.  The
                 left arm goes straight out from the shoulder, bent up at the
                 elbow (kind of like a Manual Right Turn signal for drivers or
                 bikers).  Using the triple step progression of the slow spin
                 (above, Part 1, Section 2), walk forward in a circle for 8
                 measures.
  Part 3, Section 2 - Back-bounce
    Measure 1-8 - remain in the shoulder to shoulder stance, but tighten your
                 right-hand grip.  The object here is to hop backwards in a
                 circle on your respective right feet.  This is normally done
                 by pushing off with your left foot on the first measure, and
                 then just hopping backward.  Two motions comprise this series
                 of steps - every two beats hop backward, and alternate
                 sticking your left foot straight out and bending it at the
                 knee (basically, after the first push, the left foot never
                 comes back down, it just waves in the air).
  And that's the dance - it repeats and speeds up.

  Any questions, feel free to ask.  I'm not at all sure how much sense the
   above makes - I know it very well and may be reading more into what I
   wrote than is there.  I hope you get to know and like this dance, and
   I would be delighted if you would spread it around as you see fit.

  I will be at Bhakail's Wedding event this weekend (May 14th) and at Crown
 next weekent (May 21st) if anyone in the East Kingdom (or other far travelers)
 would like a more detailed description or even a demonstration of sorts.

   This is just to make sure that Lady Eowyn Eilonwy receives my heartfelt
 thanks for her help and advice on my newly acquired office of Chronicler of
 Bhakail.  I'm posting this here because the alphabet soup of addresses that
 non-Bitneters use is rather daunting, and I'm just not sure how smart our
 Mailer is.  I know it will get to her this way, so I hope the others out
 there don't mind a personally-directed missive going to everyone.
   Again, Much thanks my Lady Eowyn.  Your help will be invaluable, and even
 confirmed a few ideas I had had on my own.

It's pretty much fine as is, and I guess it doesn't hurt to keep it on
the idealistic side--that's what we want to encourage.  (But I must say
that I don't normally think of the Chivalry in quite the way that the
letter presents them.  Maybe that's just my natural skepticism kicking
in.  I'm also not sure that the Laurels and Pelicans shouldn't get equal 
billing with the Chivalry.  There may be something magic in many people's 
eyes about the idea of a Knight, but the everyday magic that keeps the
SCA running, and doing real medieval things, deserves equal respect.)

One small glitch--in the beginning of the part entitled
               How is the SCA Organized?
the first paragraph talks about the SCA, but the second jumps into a
description of feudal Europe, without indicating that the SCA context
has been left behind.  This is a little confusing, I think, when you
get down a few more paragraphs and read about how the SCA structure is
based on the feudal structure, but is not identical to it.

You might want to add a few non-professional mundane job
classifications to the list at the end--maybe Pittsburgh is kind of
unusual this way, but we have a number of housewives, some blue-collar
folks and retired people.  And of course, the ever-present students.

These are actually pretty minor points and I think the intro note is
quite good as it is.  (I do some editing and tech writing in my mundane
job, and the above suggestions are pretty much from that perspective.)

As a bureaucrat, I do wonder if perhaps someone in the hierarchy of the
Seneschalate/Steward ought to approve it before it's widely
distributed.  Just to cover all bases (and all rear ends.)  (Well, I'm
a Seneschale, but I was thinking of somebody on the Kingdom level, or
the Steward.)

Re: personae

We co-exist with Tuchux.  We are a pretty mixed gang of personae, but
one thing we don't tend to have is barbarians.  People who start out
that way usually go to the Chux.  (Note for those who haven't
encoutered Tuchux:  they are a barbarian group loosely based on John
Norman's "Gor" books.  They range from the extremely obnoxious to the
extremely authentic, but perhaps tend more towards the former.  There are
many individual Chux who are quite talented folk.  We co-exist with them 
on a more or less even keel; some of them come to our events, some of us
go to theirs.  Their fighting rules are like slightly sub-standard SCA
armor standards plus Markland rules.  They come to the Pennsic War
every year, where they drink and drum and delight in horrifying
late-period ladies. ;-)

Reply-To: joshua@paul.rutgers.edu


Lord Orlando does make a couple good points, and since I'm the one who
posted the intro on alt.sca, I would like to address them.

I disagree with his hesitancy.  First, I really view USENET as a
public forum, not a publication.  Information distributed on this
network is always personal views, expressed as if in personal
conversation.  True, the potential audience is enormous, and care
should be taken to phrase any announcement carefully, but I see no
real problem with any individual taking that initiative.

However, I did feel that I was not the one to put together such an
introduction.  The message I posted to alt.sca was supplied by
Siobhan, the Society Chronicler.  This seems, all things considered,
to be a reasonable approach.

It might not be a bad idea to consult the BoD to see if they would
like to post some formal message to USENET, since it is getting some
play now.  Siobhan, You want to deal with that?

I think that the note that Siobhan posted is probably sufficient for
general purposes. It hits most of the bases, without being *too* long.
Also, she *is* a Society officer, I think (SCA Chronicler, right?),
so the note could be construed as reasonably official. The warning
that the BOD handed down about talking to the press is mostly so that
they don't find out that we're in the news by opening the Wall Street
Journal (to take a *purely* hypothetical example) and finding us on
page one. At least, that's the way I heard it at the time.

Subject: how to set up local redistribution (mundane)
Reply-To: paul@tut.cis.ohio-state.edu

(To the good gentles on the mailing list: this is the second request
for info that I have gotten, so I am sending it to everyone.)

Many computer systems have mail systems that allow some kind of
"alias", or shorthand, for a list of addresses of people; when mail is
sent to this name, it is delivered to all of the addresses.  On a Unix
system, these are stored in /usr/lib/aliases.  On our main mail
machine, we have a line that looks like this:

...
incoming-sca:           elwell,zwicky,paul,diana
...

To set up local redistribution, set up such a line, substituting the
names of the local users who want to get the SCA mailing list for
ours, do whatever magic to the mail system to tell it that you have
added an alias (on Unix it's "newaliases"), then send a letter to the
mailing list maintainer (in this case, Lorimbor tells me that it is
"grof%epee.dec@decwrl.dec.com", but I don't know for sure), asking
them to unsubscribe all of the individual users, and to subscribe
"incoming-sca" (make sure to use the _whole_ address).

Doing this saves a lot of time and lowers the amount of bits shoved
around on the networks, saving many $$$ in communication costs.

Greetings,

I've been discussing this News-group/Mailing-list with some of the members
of Myrkfaelinn, and we have a concern regarding the "Introduction" message
that has been proposed.  We don't have a problem with the message already
proposed, we just want to discuss some issues about it.

It would be best, though probably not most practical, to have the Society
Seneschal or Steward draft the introduction.  There are a few reasons for
this.  The most obvious is that it's probably their job to do so.

Another reason has to do with the Societies problems with the press.
It is my understanding that SCA members should get clearance from the
Society Steward before being interviewed for any national publication.
I think this is related to the recurring problems the SCA has with
getting bad press, and never any good.  Since the introductory message is
likely to be distributed internationally, I think it's important that we
be careful with it.

Comments?

Subject: What personae do people do?

Hmmm... Herds, huh?

Well, the main "herd" in Carolingia is probably 14th-16th century, mostly
Italian and French. This is probably partly due to the fact that that's
Baron Patri's period, and a good deal of the flavor of the Barony came from
Patri. Another major reason is that dancing is pretty important in Carolingia,
and that is the period that most of our dances are from. And mostly, I suspect,
it's simply because people like the garb.

Most of the people who do persona in a big way around here do something
different. Let's see:

-- We have a couple of Vikings, one a Duke, the other our former Seneschal and
   probably the two best storytellers we have.

-- Our current Seneschal is Japanese. He isn't as utterly into persona as some,
   but his armor is Japanese, and his main weapon form katana.

-- A fair number of people do Celtic of one form or another. Given the
   general mania of the Boston area for Celtic arts, this is no great
   surprise. It does make for a rather high percentage of
   unspellable names, though.

-- Our sometime Chief Chirurgeon is Chinese; he probably does persona in a
   bigger way than anyone else here. He does all ceremonies in a proper
   Chinese manner, is very up on the history and culture of his period,
   has pretty good Chinese armor, and even has his AoA scroll in Chinese
   (which, unfortunately, he can't read).

In general, I'd say that the only real trend is that Carolingia tends
towards late period. Not quite cavalier (although we have one or two of
those, mostly fencers), but hovering on the last couple of centuries.

Subject: An introductory note

(this is a note I wrote for a pamphlet a while back. I tried to pull the
blatently Middle Kingdom-specific stuff out of it, and I notice that there
is a dearth of information about heraldry, but.....
 
 
             Life in the Current Middle Ages
             _______________________________
 
SCA is the Society for Creative Anachronism, which is a group
dedicated to recreating the Middle Ages in the present. Many
groups meet weekly, and at these meetings we dance, talk, study,
learn, revel, and make plans. But first, let's get a little bit
of info about the SCA in general.
 
              Where did the SCA come from?
              ___________________________
 
 The avowed purpose of the SCA is the study and recreation of the
 Middle Ages, its crafts, sciences, arts, traditions, literature,
 etc. The SCA "period" is defined to be 600 AD to 1600 AD. Under
 the aegis of the SCA we study dance, calligraphy, martial arts,
 cooking, metalwork, stained glass, costuming, literature....
 well, if they did it, somebody in the SCA does it (Except die of
 the Plague!).
 
 As you can probably guess, the thing that separates the SCA from
 a Humanities 101 class is the *active* participation in the
 learning process. To learn costuming, you design and build
 costumes. To learn SCA infantry fighting, you make armor,
 weapons, shields, etc., and put them on and go learn how it
 feels to wear them when somebody is swinging a (rattan) sword at
 you. To learn brewing, you make (and sample!) your own wines,
 meads and beers.
 
 You will frequently hear a SCA person describe the SCA as
 recreating the Middle Ages "as they ought to have been." In some
 ways this is true -- we have few plagues, indoor plumbing, few
 peasants. In the dead of winter we have other things to eat than
 King's venison, salt pork and dried tubers.
 
 The SCA was invented (? discovered? begun?) in 1966 in Berkeley,
 California by a group of Science Fiction and Fantasy fans who
 wanted a "theme" party. Following the party, a group got
 together to discuss the idea of a medieval re-creation and
 re-enactment group. (which has ended up being much like the
 Civil War, Revolutionary War or Buckskinning re-enactment groups
 that were beginning to form in the US.) In Britain Medieval and
 British Civil War recreation societies had existed for any
 number of years. The Californians incorporated as a non-profit
 educational society, started forming groups, and away they went.
 
 Since 1966, the society has grown to include nearly 13,000
 paying members in the US, Canada, Mexico, Great Britain,
 Germany, Italy, France, Korea, Okinawa, New Zealand, Australia
 and Greenland. Current demographic estimates indicate that for
 every dues-paying member there are 4 non-subscribing members
 active in local groups.
 
               How is the SCA Organized?
               ________________________
 
 The SCA is a feudal society. No democracies for us! The SCA
 "Knowne World" is divided into twelve Kingdoms, each with a King
 and Queen (who rule by right of arms), a Prince and Princess
 (heirs to the throne), and a council or Curia of Great Officers
 who handle the mundane, day to day details of running the
 kingdom.
 
 A feudal society takes its form from the idea of honor and duty.
 A noble owes duty of service to his lord, a Baron or Knight.
 Knights owe in return the duty of protection from danger and
 food, money, etc. when times are bad.
 
 On the next level up, the Knights owe fealty (the word that
 encompasses this idea of reciprocal responsibilities) to the
 King. In return for their service as good stewards of the land
 and readily available warriors, the King owes the Knights and
 barons protection, honor, and a return of money, food, etc in
 times of hardship. It is something like the idea of a Pyramid
 club, but the benefits are greater and the idea of personal
 honor and mutual responsibility, not profit, tie the structure
 together (or at least it did in Europe for nearly a thousand
 years).
 
 In the SCA this structure underlies our Society, although not
 nearly as rigidly as in the medieval days. Our King, the head of
 our Kingdom and our liege lord, has fought for the right to bear
 the crown by fighting in a Crown Tourney for the right to make
 his Lady Queen. <In the case of female fighters, she has fought
 for the right to make her Lord King Consort.> In some Kingdoms,
 like the West (middle California), the King's word is law, and
 the people willingly obey his every whim. Of course, four months
 later there is a new King, with different ideas. Life can get
 interesting.
 
 Fighting in the SCA, or Why are those people hitting each other?
 _______________________________________________________________
 
 Fighting in the SCA evolved from what happened when two armed
 knights were unhorsed and had to fight on the ground. It
 resembles nothing so much as medieval infantry fighting. There
 are two basic types of SCA fights: single combat, and group or
 team battles, known as melees. SCA fighting does have rules. The
 first, and most important rule, is that each and every fighter
 on the field has honor. The fighter keeps faith with his honor
 by accepting blows that would be killing or wounding (more about
 this a little later).
 
 The second is like unto it; A fighter keeps faith with his
 brother fighters by acknowledging his opponent's word -- if he
 says it was light, it was light. Since we prefer that no one get
 hurt, SCA fighting is done with real armor (made with leather,
 metal, padding, kydex, etc) and rattan swords. Rattan is that
 bamboo-y stuff, only with a solid core, that furniture is made
 of. Rattan, surprisingly enough, is springy enough to absorb
 some of the force of the blow (although blows are *real solid*)
 and light enough to approximate a real steel sword. Swords are
 made by wrapping rattan staffs with strapping tape, covering
 them with duct tape (known as silver tape) for esthetic reasons,
 and attaching some sort of hilt or handle. Armor is much more
 complex -- some armor, being made of steel, rivets, leather,
 etc, can take more than 40 hours per piece of armor (for
 example, a armored "glove" with moving fingers and joints can
 take upwards of 75 hours to complete).
 
 There are several essential and required pieces of armor --
 helm, neck and cervical vertebrae protection, elbows and knees,
 kidneys, hands, groin. After that, most SCA fighters wear chest,
 leg, arm and forearm, and feet protection.
 
 If a blow hits hard enough that a sword would have cloven mail,
 it is "good". Beginning fighters, as they are being trained, are
 taught blow calibrations. Fighters are trained, by the way.
 Aspiring fighters attend some months of fighter practices where
 they learn the rules and learn how to protect themselves on the
 field. After some time, they attempt to "authorize" -- they go
 before a panel of experienced fighters, fight a couple of
 rounds, and if the panel decides the fighter is safe (not good,
 you understand, but unlikely to hurt him or herself or an
 opponent) they are authorized to fight in Tourneys. This process
 (from starting to fight to being authorized) can take from a
 couple of months to a year or more.
 
 Fighting brings us to *the Chivalry.* The Chivalry is a group of
 elite fighters -- those who have gotten very very good at
 fighting, and who at the same time have absorbed the concepts of
 Honor and Chivalry (they're basically good guys), have learned
 something of basic Heraldry, Chess, something about the Arts and
 Sciences, can behave well in public, and are generally good
 examples for people everywhere.
 
 (The word Chivalry comes from the Old French *chevalerie*
 <related to the Spanish *caballeria*>, meaning horse-fighter,
 cavalry, "knight". It came to French and Spanish from Latin
 caballerius, horse rider. As only the wealthy could afford the
 horse and trappings of a mounted warrior, it became the province
 of the nobles to be mounted and fighters. Thus the elite status.
 The word has come down to us from a different route as
 *cavalry*. Oh, well!) <There are rank-equivalents to Knights in
 the Arts and Sciences, called "Laurels", and in the Services,
 called "Pelicans". I will discuss them later on!>
 
 A King (if he is himself a Knight, and not all Kings are) can
 knight a fighter if he (or she) thinks the candidate is
 deserving. Usually the other Chivalry have agreed, or it doesn't
 happen. (If the King isn't a Knight, another member of the
 Chivalry can hold the sword with the King. Only a Knight can
 make a Knight.) The Knights swear personal fealty to the Crown.
 Since some people, for religious reasons, reasons of personal
 honor, etc, feel that swearing fealty is inappropriate for them,
 a branch of Chivalry has been created, called Masters, who do
 not have to swear fealty. Upon receiving the accolade of
 Knighthood, the candidate receives a Gold chain to wear about
 the neck, a white belt, and gold spurs. Some receive a *real*
 sword, as well.
 
       Why Do you all have such funny names?
       _____________________________________
 
 Every person in the SCA picks a name to use in the Society. It
 could be something simple (George of Wardcliff) or something
 elaborate (Dughall Aislean nic mac Lathurna). Most people pick a
 time period in the SCA "period" (between 600 and 1600) and a
 country (any place that can documentably be proven to have had
 trade with western Europe during the period), and choose a name
 from that. Some people just pick a name and forget about it;
 some have elaborate persona stories to go with their names.
 
 Even our towns have new names. Lansing, MI, is Northwoods,
 Toronto is Septentria, Boston is Carolingia, the San Francisco
 bay area is the Principality of the Mists, etc.
 
 Most folk in the SCA register their names and a heraldic device
 that they design to represent them. Also, later in their SCA
 careers, they may be given awards and rank, at which time their
 devices become "Arms" and they are most properly called "Lord"
 or "Lady So-and-So."
 
 Rank in the SCA, or How Come She is Wearing a Crown?
 ____________________________________________________
 
 There are two sorts of peers in the SCA; Royal Peers and Peers.
 Royal Peers are folk who have worn the crown of a Kingdom or
 Principality at least once. Ex-Princes are Viscounts,
 Ex-Princesses Viscountesses, and from there it gets complex.
 Those who have been King or Queen once are Counts/Countesses.
 Those who have been King or Queen twice are Dukes/Duchesses.
 Those who have been King or Queen more than that are generally
 considered masochistic! (Small in-joke!) Seriously, there are
 many who have reigned at least three times, and in the West
 there is a legendary Duke who has been King eight times.
 
 Other sorts of Peers are folk who, through dint of talent, hard
 work, and long effort, are recognized for their contributions
 and skills. We have already talked about the Knights. There are
 also the Laurels (Talented craftsmen and artists, recognized for
 having talents and being willing to teach and be gracious), and
 the Pelicans (generally skilled bureaucrats -- somebody *has* to
 do the hard paperwork of running a Kingdom with 3000 people in
 it, and some people keep working at this sort of task for
 years.). The Pelican was thought in medieval times to be the
 most self-sacrificing animal -- it was thought a Pelican would
 pierce her beast to allow her heart's blood to drip into the
 mouths of her offspring when food was short. Peers are made by
 the desire of the King and Queen in accordance with the
 recommendations of the rest of the order.
 
          Feasting, Dancing and Merrymaking
          ________________________________
 
 One of the most interesting parts of the SCA is the Events --
 the times when we put on our costumes, go out and dance those
 dances we've been practicing, flirt, eat, talk, and generally
 party. Events are held almost every weekend of the year
 somewhere in the country. Most groups hold at least one event
 per year; some larger groups will hold two or more.
 
 At events there are often tourneys, art exhibits or
 competitions, dance classes, workshops, and, later in the
 evening, Royal or Baronial Court, and dancing. Many times there
 will be a Feast in the evening. Other times, for smaller events
 or if a newer group is holding the event, there will be a
 dessert revel (People go out for dinner and then come back for a
 dessert buffet).
 
 The events are the most fun to most folk, because you get to go
 and show off all the things you have been learning in the past
 few months.
 
          What Kind of Person Joins the SCA?
          __________________________________
 
 SCA folk tend to be people like you and me -- just plain folks,
 but people who enjoy doing something more with their weekends. A
 high percentage of SCA members are involved in high tech fields
 -- Computers, Aerospace, high energy physics, etc. This has been
 attributed to the fact that people who play all week with highly
 complex, modern technology find it highly relaxing to spend
 their leisure time working with a different kind of technology,
 in a less modern setting. There are lots of people in all fields
 in the SCA -- historians, writers, secretaries, law enforcement
 personnel, teachers, programmers, insurance agents -- the appeal
 of the SCA is widespread.
 
 A housemate of a SCA person recently said: "From what I can tell
 about these wild and crazy SCA people, they do more than just
 this fighting thing. They really like to make and wear the
 medieval clothes (garb), eat the medieval food, dance the
 medieval dances to the medieval music, maybe even make their own
 medieval music, and other medieval party type activities. They
 also seem to like to be medieval so they can relax and have a
 good time. They are quite willing to talk about SCA or invite
 you to the SCA stuff or whatever."
 
               How You Can Get Involved
               _______________________
 
 We welcome you to our local meetings and our events. You needn't
 join the SCA, Inc, to attend and participate (although if you
 decide to be with us regularly you may wish to join). The only
 requirement to come to an event is that you make some attempt at
 pre-1600 costume -- and most groups have "loaner" costumes for
 people who want to come to their first event.
 
 If you want more information about groups near you, you can call
 our corporate office in Milpitas, CA, at (408) 262-5250, or send
 a notice to this mailing list or newsgroup, or contact the
 Society Chronicler (Pat McGregor) at (517) 351-4962 (email:

Subject: Persona Majorities/Minorities

Greetings to the readers of the SCAnet.

Does your kingdom/local group have persona minorities/majorities? Do you
have persona "trends"? What would your group consider a -standard- persona
and what persona would be considered -strange and unusual-?

I've watched the persona trends in An Tir with some interest ever since I
joined the SCA, and I find ebb and flow of "fashionable" personas to be
intriguing.

We (An Tir) have a had strong streak of Viking fighters for quit a few years
now, and they've left their mark on the Kingdom: King Dak, King Torgul,
King Thorin, King Eirik, and our current Royalty, King Steingrim. Although
known primarily as stick-jocks, they have also developed the kingdom's
awareness of Norse Arts through their finely carved camp gear, their armour,
apparel and passtimes. (Anyone heard of their "Silly Norse Games"?)
There are also quite a number of early-period Celtic, Norse, Frankish, and
Saxon personas. (Generally seen in tourney season when the garb is more
comfortable, many metamorphasize into later-period glitz for the banquet
season.)

As a contrast, we have relatively few Japanese, Cavaliers, or Landescanecht
(sp?).

A persona trend that I see just developing here are the Mongols.  No doubt
inspired by Dak's much-respected and admired queen, Lao, they are tending
more towards complete persona development and Mongolian arts.

So - what are the major "persona herds" in your kingdom/area? Do they come
and go or are they lasting? 

I'd like to repeat my previous offer:
And are there any Society Officers or BOD Members reading SCAnet?
The BOD will be meeing in Lions Gate (Vancouver BC Canada) in October, I
believe. I hereby offer my services as courier between those making the
arrangements and our autocrats.  (I spoke with one of our autocrats, 
Countess Melissa, over the weekend and she would be pleased to make use
of this "quick-mail".)

Subject: Novices and newsgroups

I am quite in agreement with Lady Siobhann that this is a great 
opportunity to contact new people, and we should not just tolerate,
but encourage new people to talk with us.  The idea had been brought up
of regularly posting a standard newbie letter, of the "Welcome to the 
Current Middle Ages" type.  We could also keep standard info pieces
on fighting, dancing, wars, revels, etc.  I would be willing to write 
one or more of these, but I would not be receiving the newsgroup, so
someone else would have to keep them, and post or send to those who
ask questions.  

A side note on the unexplained mysteries side of things:  It looked 
pathetically obvious to me and my friends that this poor guy went to
a VERY dangerous part of town at 3 in the morning, and got jumped by 
a gang of thugs.  His armor, being unusual, was of course stolen, and
his car taken for a joyride.  San Francisco is not a sympathetic place.
I am glad to know that we have had few problems because of this 
incident.  An SF television station did a blurb on the recent West-Caid
war that was well-done, responsible journalism, and I hope that this
will help to balance the sensationalistic garbage.

Unto Kwelland-Njal, From Arval Benicoeur, Brigantia Principal Herald,
Greetings. 

What you've got is an interesting design, but not really in itself
consistent with medieval heraldic design.  Medieval heraldry didn't
run to lots of thin lines intersecting in an interesting pattern;
rather, it had a small number of large, bold, easily recognized
elements in a simple & balanced design.  Your design is quite nice,
and I agree that it makes a nice signiture-mark, but it isn't true to
the style of heraldry found in medieval Europe.  For the record, if
that design were submitted in the East, I think I would decide to
return it as too complex and for including too many thin, difficult to
distinguish lines.  

On the other hand, what you have is not very different for the
conventional representation of a snowflake: the only differences are
the fretting at the center & the absense of the bits sticking out
around the outer edge.  All in all, if this were one component of a
design, were described as a snowflake, and the design was otherwise
acceptable, I think I'd be inclined to accept it.  And since a
snowflake is a rather unusual, though perfectly good, charge, it
should be possible to get something rather simple registered.  Thus,
you might consider:

Azure, a snowflake and a chief wavy argent.

Azure, three snowflakes and a chief wavy argent.

Azure, a fess wavy argent ermined azure between three snowflakes
argent.

There are lots of possibilities which might work.  What do you think
of it?

Subject:  Re: Newcomers and a question for the heralds...

I would like to second Siobhan's note about taking care to not
look upon those who will contact us through a newsgroup as a 
pain.  I'm sure that most of us were pretty raw when we first 
took an interest too.  We will need a letter summarizing the society
that can be posted once every month or so, and it wouldn't be a 
bad idea to have one person designated (volunteers?) to send one
(so that there is only one!) copy of the letter-of-introduction
to the new people who show up asking questions (a hospitler to the
net??) and generally answer questions.  Given that we have such a
diversity of experiance here perhaps we should consider trying
to nail down a "definative" intro-to-the-SCA document that we
could then make available to the Society at large.  Comments?

	And a real honest question for you heralds out there:
I have a proposed device to be submitted, but the local herald 
has reservations about it.  I have support for all the individual
components, but he doesn't like the whole of it, though it is
unique and recognizable from a distance.  Here is the blazon off the
top of my head (bearing in mind I'm *not* a herald):

Azure, on a hexagon argent, voided, two shakeforks fretted argent.

It looks something like this (charge only):

                            /\          Well, very,very crudely.  On
                           //\\     paper it is more equallateral, and
                          ///\\\    all the lines come out correctly.
                         // || \\     But this is basically it.

	He has agreed to submit it, but says the dreaded "It doesn't
feel right."  Since this is the closest heraldicly correct version
of an element of my signature I've used on artwork since the mid-sixties
I would *really* like to have it or something very like it on my
device.  Suggestions?

Unto all and sundry of strong lungs and patient disposition, Greetings
from Arval Benicoeur, Brigantia Herald, and (St. Pyr help me!) War
Herald.

In the upcoming months, many events in and around the East will be
needing heavy heraldic turnout.  To wit:

Crown Tourney, An Dubhaigeainn, 21 May
War of the Roses, Concordia, Labor Day Weekend
Pennsic War, anyone who don't know is comatose

I will probably not be at War of the Roses, so I would like to request
of all Eastern heralds that you particularly try to ge there & help
out.  There should be a large consulting table, and they will need
major heraldic work for crying the camp.  think of as good practice
for...


The War.  Yes.  Well.  I would like to request that anyone who is
confident of his voice (no sexism, just grammatical convention) please
try to show up at Herald's Point to cry the camp once or twice during
the week.  Over the course of the week, I figure we need a total of
about 400 voices, which really isn't too much considering there will
be about 5000 people present.  We will have sign-up sheets, or you can
just drop by.  In addition, if you have a herald's tabard you can loan
us for the duration, we would deeply appreciate it.  For warranted
heralds: I expect every herald present at the War to stop by & meet
Badger Herald & me, and to cry the camp or otherwise contribute to the
general heraldic effort AT LEAST twice during the week.  That is what
you are being paid for.  And besides, we really really need you.  

In addition, I invite anyone interested to come drop by Heralds' Point
and schmooze.  We never refuse invititations to dinner or wanderers
bearing intriguing bottles.

Seeya there.

Arval.

The newsgroup alt.sca exists.  It is distributed to many places: I
suspect any site which wants it can get it.  However, most of the
people who noticed it are NOT sca people, and are somewhat mystified.
Would someone out there put together a couple paragraphs of intro to
the SCA & mail it to me so I can post it to the group for the general
public.  This could actually be a REALLY good opportunity.  Siobhan,
have you got anything worthwhile in your files?  Can we give your
e-address as general contact person for further info/info about local
groups?

Now the question is do we want to dismantle the mailing list in favor
of the newsgroup?  I don't think so, since the flood through the
mailing lsit has died down somewhat.

It sounds like there is a real live project to gateway ARPA mailing

Hail, Well Met, and Hi!

I'm afraid my participation in the net is rather stronger than my
participation in the SCA, but nevertheless, I am also a 15th century
Italian (well, Italianate Englishman), from around Florence. As
my name somewhat indicates (Raphael the Alchemist), I am also
interested in alchemy, but truth to tell, the appellation is really
more of a joke considering my real interest in natural history.
University of Bologna, I *think*.

Anyhow, my interests include heraldry and gaming as well. Perhaps we
can communicate a bit more, inasmuch as everyone around here seems
to be Dark Ages Germanic or Celtic, and I haven't met any other
latter day Florentines before....

Hawkwood Lives.....

Subject: names in Kansas City (Forgotten Sea, in Calontir)

Good cousins --
 
I suspect I may end up as a convenient resource for questions
such as Lord Leif's about groups, as I get all the newsletters
and lists in my capacity as Society Chronicler! Just don't send
me event announcements!
 
At any rate, the group is Kansas City is called Forgotten Sea,
and the Seneschal is named Lord John the Lost.
 
  Mka: John Page
       1400  Colorado
       Kansas City, MO 64127-2425
       (816) 241-0854
 
Two interesting events are coming up in that area in may: The
crown Tourney, which is in Forgotten Sea May 21, and The war of
the Lilies, which is always a marvelous event, is Memorial Day
Weekend.
 
You should also contact Sir Cire and his lady Mistress Elizabeth,
who are charming and delightful folk. IF you have interests in
Heraldry, be certain to make the acqaintance of Baron Charles
Stewart O'Connor, who also lives in the area.
 
My good wishes to you, Lord Leif!

Subject: Greetings + Kansas City

Greetings Good Gentels,

        My name is Leif Aagesen (mundanely Steven Jensen).  At current I have
stopped in my travels a good 9 months to learn from the scholars in the area
known as the Barony-Marche of the Debatable Lands in the Kingdom of the East
(mundanely Carnegie Mellon in Pgh., Pa).  It is here that I met up with the SCA
and have participated in many enjoyable diversions.  But alas, I must travel to
the Kingdom of Calintir (sp?) for the summer months, in particular the area
around Kansas City.  I would be interested in finding out how I may contact the
SCA in this land.  I am currently involved in dancing, rattan, and archery, but
if schedule permits I will probably participate in other activities.

                                        Much Thanks,

                                        Leif

Subject: "novice" questions and our attitudes about newbies

Good gentles,
 
I'm very disturbed by the tone of some comments about "answering
novice questions." We were all once novices, and all once asked
questions which were born of ignorance and naivete. Please, let
us not forget in the rush to enjoy our marvelous electronic toy
that we are members of a Society in which the ideal is Chivalry
and Courtesy.
 
If we attract potential new members who see our mailings going
by, and those folk ask questions about the SCA and how it works,
Hoorah! we can certainly reach more people via electronic mail
than all the single interactions in a hour will ever reach. We
should *not* use this media to become an elitist clique of those
old-time SCAfolk who are lucky enough to know about electronic
mail.
 
Concerning the "unsolved Mysteries" show: Altho there have been
many verbal reports of problems resulting from this show, no one
has yet to make a formal report including dates of the problems,
location, or the names of people involved. If you know of such an
occurance and can substatiate it, you should report it
immediately to the Steward, who is looking for side effects of
the show.
 
And if we do get queries resulting from the show, as the Middle
Kingdom groups got inquiries following the sad Dallas Egbert
incident in late 1979, then we should view these queries as a
chance to educate, not a burden or trial.
 
I know that my personal bias is that in all our interactions we
should uphold the ideals of the Society. Can we please, as we
raise this new child that the mailgroup has blossomed into, not
fall into the traps that our cousins on other newsgroups have
plummetted into? Can we not have personal attacks, not be
unwelcoming or unfriendly, and not be cynical and unwilling to
open our eyes to new ideas? We have the most wonderful and
courteous Society in this world, and I would like our electronic
interactions to be a reflection of those ideals which we espouse
when we wear our garb and become our personas.
 
I remain, in service to our Society,
 
      siobhan

Subject: Local Distribution and a Request for Advice

Unto all the gentles of this poor beset mailing list,

Two things.

First, a general request for advice. I would like to put together a small
get-together for dancemasters and dancemaster-like persons at Pennsic. The
purpose of this would be so that we can get together and swap dances. This
is to help correct a problem I have been seeing: none of us have *enough*
period dances, but we all know different ones. In the holy name of 
communication, let's see what we can do about this.

The question is: who do I talk to? There are so many sub-autocrats at the
war, I can't keep them all straight. Ought I talk to the Music Autocrat?
Who is in charge of Barn scheduling (and does anyone know if there is any
time left that the Barn is free?) Is there any sort of Dance Autocrat who
I should be in contact with? Do I need to talk to the General Autocrat
before putting an announcement into Pikestaff about this? etc, etc...

The second thing is a technical point, so all non-techies can stop reading
before I bore you. How do we set up a local redistribution of the mailing
list? We have at least three people at I**2 who are on the list, so we ought
to have local redistribute. Do I need to talk to my sysadmin about this?

In service to the society (if not the bureaucracy),

Subject: Becoming a newsgroup (long)
Reply-To: paul@tut.cis.ohio-state.edu

First, a _short_ introduction: Hi, I'm Tofi Kerthjalfadsson, MK Clerk
of Precedence.  "I'm not a Herald, I'm not a Herald (and this isn't my
nose, it's a false one 8-)..."  I'm interested (at least some) in all
manner of things, especially brewing, heraldry, dance, being silly,
etc.

Justin du Coeur writes:
  Disadvantages of becoming a newsgroup:
  1) Time lag. This newsletter is very nearly instantaneous; I've sent
  plenty of messages to the mailing list that had replies coming in from
  all over within two hours. The average propagation time is a good deal
  less than a day. A newsgroup, by its very nature, has a propagation lag
  of *at least* one day, and frequently it takes 3-4 days to propagate
  out to the backwaters of the net. This would be annoying; part of what
  is fun about the mailing list is that you can almost hold interactive
  conversations.

Actually, this isn't really true.  The almost instant delivery is
mainly due to the ARPA net, and if you are running NNTP
(tut.cis.ohio-state.edu does), then you get turn around that is almost
as good.

  2) Twits....

Given.  One solution would be to make it a moderated group, but that
would slow things down, and probably be a full time job for the
moderator, so it probably isn't the way.

The other way would be to do what soc.women does, which is to silently
ignore the twits.  In general, the twits are trying to incite flames,
and if you don't give them any notice, they will (in time) slink away.

  3) Hassle. We would have to set up the gateway between ARPA and Usenet,
  so that people who don't get a newsfeed could keep getting the messages.
  I saw the message from someone saying that they were planning on doing
  something of the sort, but my understanding is that such things are a
  bit of a pain to set up.

Fortunately, Bob Sutterfield has allready set this stuff up for the
GNU mailing list/gnu.* newsgroups at our site.  With proper
gatewaying, a person can subscribe to the mailing list if they don't
get the newsgroup and won't notice the difference (except for the long
message headers).  This is why Lorimbor (Clayton) suggested it.

One further thing, to keep costs and traffic down I *strongly* suggest
that people subscribe to this mailing list via local redistribution
aliases.  At OSU, for instance, "incoming-sca" is the name that the
mailing list sends to, and we add our names to "incoming-sca" to get
messages.  This saves a *lot* of traffic over the networks.

  A newsgroup would have the advantage of having its existence readily known
to all. At present word of the list's existence has spread slowly through
osmosis, and will stay that way unless, as I suggested, a notice is posted in
news.lists.
   However, I do not feel that a group devoted to a single organization is
appropriate. I would rather see a broad-based rec.living-history which would
cover all such bodies, possibly with
the list continuing as a "narrow-gauge"
alternative.

Message-ID: <371948.880506.CENT@AI.AI.MIT.EDU>

Time for my two cents.  I am Lady Eowyn Eilonwy of Alewife Brook, a
Carolingian since the summer before Pennsic II (with about three years time
out somewhat later to see what college might have to offer), and Danulf's
sponsor in moving this list to the AI machine from his work machine at DEC
which was overloaded. AI is overloaded too, but what else is new?
    The list was moved here because the ITS community is friendly toward
such non-work-related things -- yes, gentles, these are your tax dollars at
work speeding your SCA mail over the DoD's ArpaNet -- and because COMSAT,
our mailer, is competent.  ITS is the Incompatible Timesharing System,
which is what runs here; it is -not- unix.  There are many other machines
on the connected nets which also run something other than unix.  So all
those who are interested in setting up a UUCP newsgroup should, as Lord
Danulf requested, talk to him personally rather than this whole list, and
the newsgroup organizing committee should take care to avoid steps which
would complicate receiving SCA-list mail for those of us who do not use
unix (or who do but do not receive newsgroups).
    For the gentle who was ignorant of Usenet: I think you had a BITNet
address, so you are probably aware that BITNet, CSNet, and ArpaNet form a
somewhat interlocking set of networks now more or less subsumed into the
compass of the Internet; Arpa hosts are connected by dedicated phone
cables, and probably so are most CSNet and BITNet machines.  Usenet, also
referred to as UUCP (unix-unix communication protocol), is a situation
where unices call each other up on the phone and exchange any accumulated
mail. Folks on Usenet can give you more details about the mechanics and
internal politics of this, but the vital elements are that only unix
machines can do UUCP transfers (so if your local machine runs something
else, you can't receive newsgroups), and unices -- more exactly, those who
run them -- can choose whether, and how much, to participate (which other
unices to dial up for mail exchanges, which newsgroups to accept).  In any
case, if you haven't been aware of UseNet, don't worry; you will be able to
receive mail from this list regardless of whether anything happens on the
UUCP newsgroup front.
    Enough already! Let us consign these machinations to the behind the
scenes arena they deserve, except for a possible future announcement from
those attempting to organize this newsgroup effort of a fait accompli.

    My lord Brigantia, as to your query last week as to whether a separate
list for discussing heraldry would be appropriate: My opinion is that you
should continue to conduct such discussions on the main list until you
receive a significant number of wails of protest.

Hello,

   Again formal introductions shall wait.  Also messages on the
ultimate sense in fighting with/for Stonemarche against the northern
barbarians.

   At the risk of sounding like a novice, what is a usenet?

  On point, I believe it was 3) of Justin's letter, I heartily agree.
I have spent far too much time answering novice's questions. Again.
And again.

   I tend to agree on the way and see with the newsgroup.  (Note on
the above question...

    what is usenet?  what is a newsgroup?  ).

                -yours in confusion, Brigid

Like I said in my message this morning, we have everything needed to do
this here at OSU; all I was wondering is if other people though it would
be a good idea.  Now, if there's going to be some sort of 'official'
gateway, then I won't worry about it (in which case it would be
'rec.sca' or something), but to form 'alt.sca' all I have to do is set
up a couple of files and send out the initial message.  I could do this
tonight.

Subject: Last note for today about newsgroups

I do feel sort of like I'm drinking Coke out of a can at a feast, what
with all this technical talk about news...  Sigh.  I'll make one last
comment:  One of the reasons I suggested an 'alt' group instead of a
real live 'official' newsgroup is that the 'alt' groups are carried
voluntarily, and thus the decision about whether or not to carry them
is up to individual sites.  I am willing to set this up, but it was
just an idea for getting the list propagated to more people with less
pain :-).  Tell you what... send me votes!  If you'd like to get it
via news, tell me so (and also say whether or not your site gets the
'alt' newsgroups).  If you'd rather keep it in mail, tell me that too.  Note
that one does not preclude the other.  This would be an *addition* to
the current scheme, not a replacement...

Anyway, back to SCA.  Anyone know of a good place to buy real vellum in
the U.S.?  Pendragon in Minneapolis has it, but it's actaully cheaper to
send an order to England and pay transatlantic shipping charges.  this,
of course, takes a long time...  I'm looking for around $10/sq. ft.
Any ideas?  Also, anyone want (or know of anyone who would want) to go
in on a combined order for some vellum to get the price down?

Subject: On authentic persona
Reply-To: joshua@paul.rutgers.edu


I just read Lord Eduardo Bardi's letter about his history in the
Society, and I am moved to praise him for switching from a Sword &
Sorcery persona to a good period persona.  As a herald, I have often
had the painful duty of explaining to people that, after years in the
SCA, they must now change their names.  This always causes hard
feelings, and is never any fun.

The solution, of course, is to help people pick REAL names & real
personae to go with them.  That, I believe, is the job of every
SCAdian, and especially the job of any herald.  When one of the newly
de-mundaned comes to his first event or meeting, he is always looking
for someone to help him out, someone to tell him what the SCA is for,
what it is about.  We should all make the effort to sit down with
these new members and explain the Society.  Every new member asks the
same questions: "What is a persona? How do I choose a name?"  It is at
this point that so many are given bad advice, and set up for later
problems.  Don't answer "Oh, anything you want to call yourself is
OK".  Don't answer "Gee, your D&D character has a nice name"  And
especially don't answer "Make something up"!  The Society is a
historical research & recreation group, at least to some degree, and
one of the easiest ways to encourage a little authenticity is to
answer "You should choose a real name from your period".

The added benefit of this approach is, of course, that the new member
learns from the start that research is highly valued by the Society,
that learning is always praised.  With any luck, he'll find a taste
for it, and develop a persona that really COULD have existed, take up
a craft that really was practiced in his period, and never ever ever
have to argue with the heralds over why he should be alowed to call
himself Brupwik van MacPherson.

Respectfully yours,

	Arval Benicouer, CSC.

Subject: Becoming a newsgroup (long)


Ok, it appears to me that there are a lot of people here who aren't real
sure about the pros/cons and procedures of becoming a Usenet newsgroup.

First, procedure. 

The first step we would need to make would be to decide whether we want to
try to be "official". An official newsgroup is one that the members of
the Usenet Backbone all agree that they will carry, and goes on Gene Spafford's
"List of Lists". This doesn't force anyone to carry the group, but most
sites will carry anything that goes on spaf's list.

The alternative is to become an "alt" group. This would be a group that
wouldn't be on The List, but would be carried at the individual site's 
discretion. The propagation of the "alt" hierarchy is around 50-60% of the
net, typically.

The advantage of being in the official hierarchy is that you get very good
propagation; since we would be a "rec" group, not every site would carry
us, but about 95% probably would.

The disadvantage is that you have to deal with the bureaucracy of the net,
at least initially. To become an official group, you should follow the
guidelines set forth by spaf, to wit:

	1) announce, in "news.groups" and anywhere else you feel relevant,
	   your intention to create this group.
	2) discuss it for a week or two, and get criticisms.
	3) make a "final form" announcement, and call for votes.
	4) collect votes for 30 days. At the end of this, if you have 100
	   more "yes" votes than "no" votes, you send a message to that
	   effect to the backbone (to spaf, I think), along with the
	   list of the voters.
	5) spaf creates the group.

This isn't quite how things officially work, since the net is supposedly
an anarchy, but this is the reality.

If you lose the vote, what to do? Either a) you go back to being a mailing
list, or b) you *then* decide to join the alt hierarchy, and send messages
around trying to convince people to carry your group. In the case of alt.sca,
it would probably be pretty easy, since we have people infiltrated well-nigh
everywhere.

*If* we decide that we want to be a newsgroup, then we probably ought to
at least try to be official. The gain in propagation is worth the hassles,
and it's always possible to fall back ten and join the alt hierarchy.

Advantages of becoming a newsgroup:
1) Visibility. Finding out about a mailing list requires *reading* the
List of Mailing Lists, and not all that many people bother. Finding
rec.sca in the newsgroups lists is probably easier for a novice netter
to deal with.

2) Load. Let's face facts. In the week or two since this mailing list
got its act together, the amount of traffic has skyrocketed. If this
keeps up, its going to eventually be noticed by MIT (mailing lists
cost a *lot* of phone time). A newsgroup is pretty expensive to the
net as a whole, but the cost is distributed to a very small amount per
site. I have heard several people on the net say that, after about
150 people, it actually becomes *cheaper* overall to have a newsgroup.
I'm not sure how that works, but if true, it's a good argument to
become the newsgroup.

Disadvantages of becoming a newsgroup:
1) Time lag. This newsletter is very nearly instantaneous; I've sent
plenty of messages to the mailing list that had replies coming in from
all over within two hours. The average propagation time is a good deal
less than a day. A newsgroup, by its very nature, has a propagation lag
of *at least* one day, and frequently it takes 3-4 days to propagate
out to the backwaters of the net. This would be annoying; part of what
is fun about the mailing list is that you can almost hold interactive
conversations.

2) Twits. We would get far more novices asking first-time questions.
This could be helped by someone putting together a "What is the SCA?"
article, and sending that to the group once a month or so, but we would
still see a lot of repetitive questions; every newsgroup does. Worse,
we would probably encounter the occasional idiot whose only knowledge
of the Society comes from "Unsolved Mysteries", who would come in like
a bull in a china shop, accusing us all of being Satanists. And there 
would be no way to get rid of him/her/it.  I'm not saying that this would 
be a common occurance, but it only takes one twit to wreck everyone else's fun.

3) Hassle. We would have to set up the gateway between ARPA and Usenet,
so that people who don't get a newsfeed could keep getting the messages.
I saw the message from someone saying that they were planning on doing
something of the sort, but my understanding is that such things are a
bit of a pain to set up.

So. This is, I think, a reasonably fair look at the issues. *If* the
concensus of opinion is that we should become a newsgroup, then I would
recommend waiting a month or two before doing it; being able to say,
"Look, we've had fifteen to twenty messages a *day* for the past two
months on this variety of different topics" would go a fair ways towards
convincing people that the group is needed (although other people would
probably gripe about "bloody high-volume newsgroups").

Think about it -- don't just make knee-jerk decisions. A mailing list and
a newsgroup are *very* different critters in their dynamics. Each has
plusses and minusses. (My personal opinion is: wait a while. If our
volume stays up, and our membership continues to rise, then think about
becoming a newsgroup when we hit 100-125).

Greetings good gentles,
 
     I will send out an introduction note in the next day or two, when I have
a bit more time.  Right now, I just want to address the alt.sca proposal,
before it gets too much momentum.  I don't think an alt group is the way to
go.  I know of one unofficial group recently that was having terrible
propogation problems, for the very reason that it was unofficial (we couldn't
get it at DEC until it became official).  I have no objections to a
newsgroup, but if we have one, and I think it's a good idea, please let's
have it be official.

WAR on WEASELS!!!
.   Greetings, gentles, from Lady Alycia Genevive of Amrenth.  I'm the
    Chancellor of the Exchequer for the Barony of Stonemarche, and I'd
    like to point out some ramifications of the impending hostilities
    between the Veassllurds and Stonemarche. 
 
    Note to Veassls:  Is to not worry about big words.  Is to trust 
		      peaceful neighbors to say nice things about Veassls.
 
    In October of AS XXI, Their Royal Majesties, Randal and Marieke, created 
    the Barony of Stonemarche (mundanely all of New Hampshire).  Less than 
    a month later, several Veassllurds attended an event in our barony, and 
    announced that they perceived our behavior as antagonistic -- they think 
    we're massing on their borders (we used to be 3 separate shires)!  In 
    secret!  It turns out that since they can't read, they were unaware of 
    our PEACEFUL motivations for forming a barony (clearly announced in 
    Pikestaff).  Their self-importance in thinking that we were banding
    together to attack them is laughable. 
 
    So, please remember that if you join them, you will be declaring 
    yourself an enemy of the Eastern Crown, which created this barony.  
    Any mercenaries who would like to be employed by the side of Right are 
    welcome to contact us, to discuss terms.
 
    [Disclaimer: This is all in fun.  The two groups are *not* really 
	     	 hostile!  Please don't flame . . . ]
 
    Now that that's out of the way, I can give the rest of my introduction!
    I joined the Society in AS XV, in the Barony Marche of the Debatable 
    Lands (mundanely Pittsburgh, PA).  After several years there, I moved 
    to Dragonship Haven (Southern Connecticut).  While living there, I was
    betrothed to Herr Johan von Traubenberg (known to some of you perhaps as 
    the proprietor of the late lamented Sated Tyger Inn).  I moved to New 
    Hampshire about 4 years ago, and have happily seen the SCA her progress 
    from shires with unspellable and unpronouncable names to the Barony 
    of Stonemarche.  I've autocratted a number of events, some more 
    successfully than others, and would be interested in discussing 
    different viewpoints on and sttyles of autocratting.

some of the participants in this conference do not have newsgroup software,
so news is not a general solution to network traffic.  Only, one that will
help a percentage of the population out there.

(For instance, many VMS sites do not support UUCP new)

Further: many system managers *hate* newsgroups, because they EAT disk space...
I used to work at a UUCP site where they started to remove newsgroups... and I
think they eventually dropped news support...  (Disk space, the final frontier)

Hi.  My name is Edward M. Averett.  My new SCA name is almost certainly going 
to be Eduardo Bardi.  Apellations may be added later.  I used to be involved 
with the SCA until about 6 years ago, having joined in 1978.  My handle used 
to be Corwyn Llewellyn of Mona, but those days are long past.  My new persona 
is 15th Century Italian, from around Florence. I am still working on details, 
but as Shava has already mentioned, I have every intention of doing some 
serious historical alchemy and apothecary research.  I am beginning to develop
a library of the stuff, and expect to be reasonably outfitted in about 6
months.  I am squire to Sir Patri de Chat Gris, Baron of Carolingia.  I am 
interested in foppish clothes in general, dance, gaming, heavy lists, alchemy 
and apothecary.  I'm pretty much a jack of all trades.  

In real life, I'm also a jack of all trades, a philosophy major from college 
days, and a financial administrator by current job description.  

More details can be had by request, but my normal inclination would be to 
write a large amount of stuff that wouldn't interest a lot of folk.  I suspect 
that as we converse, we'll get to know each other better.  

A few first comments:

As many people who aren't dance masters should write as much as they can so it 
doesn't look like this mailing list is dance@ai.ai.mit.edu.

As I have had to learn the hard way on another very very (makes this look like 
very very little) high volume mailing list on the net, if you are overwhelmed 
by the amount coming in, then either just delete whatever subject headings 
you can live without, or file it and read it later, or skim it and prune out 
the sundry materials.  While it's very hard to start doing this if it's 
something you are interested in, I often wait a couple of days before 
responding to a message.  By then half-a-dozen other people have answered 90% 
of the questions/comments and I can give only a summary of what needs to be 
filled in.  Of course, if we all did this, the volume on the net would be 
reduced, but then we wouldn't have the problem; so we would all start 
responding immediately, which would . . . oh well.  I often seem to get lost 
in the circles.  

Till next time.

In fact, if you COULD get a newsgroup set up, it would be much more
convenient: anyone could post message to it, old messages would be
automatically archived & available to anyone, even if they joined the
newsgroup later, and there would be no need for you to monitor the
mailing list.  Furthermore, each reader could read messages at his
convenience, instead of having them mixed in with the general
communications of email.

I don't know who to talk to about this idea, but I support it!

This sounds like a fine idea to me.  I just joined this list a few days
ago, and am already concerned about the volume.  I have to process too
much "work" mail as it is.  Putting this traffic in NetNews would be
helpful.

Creating a SCA newsgroup is a definite step up.  You'll reach many, many
more people, and certainly introduce a few new people to the SCA.  You'll
also get better distribution on BITNET than you've had to date, and I
hasten to add that there is a healthy contingent of SCAdians on BITNET.
I would strongly suggest going forward with making it an official
newsgroup.  Is good!

It sounds like a good idea to me... I haven't htought about it in depth, but
my initial reaction is:
>It would also take a load off of Dana,
GREAT!
of course, I am not familiar w/ the Usenet newsgroups... so I am not sure what
advantage/disadvantage of an alt.sca newsgroup would be... how would the news-
group people post to the group?

-Another advantage is lower network overhead... a good thing...

More open communication, more available communication... is a lot of what this
list is about... I am trying to bridge the distance gaps within the society,
and avoid regionalism, promote knowledge, spread information faster... any 
way to do this sounds good...

So, folks, we seem to have quite a bit of traffic here; more than
several Usenet newsgroups that I read, in fact...  I like it.

Our site is pretty well-connected to both ARPA and Usenet, and I'd be
willing to set up a newsgroup called "alt.sca" or something, and
gateway stuff to and from the mailing list.  This would (a) allow
people that don't have easy ARPA access to take part, and (b) prevent
interesting mail from getting mixed up with the lists of backup
schedules and so on that come to my presonal mailbox.

It would also take a load off of Dana, since he wouldn't have to keep
track of anyone who gets it via news.  Since this would be an 'alt'
group, it wouldn't go everywhere on Usenet, but it would probably hit
most major universties and so on.

  Greeting:
  For those of you who have managed not to hear of me, I am Baron Alfgar the 
Sententious, M.L, C.S.C., etc ("Call me 'Baron', imbecile!"). I was one of the 
first members of the East Kingdom, being at the accession and coronation of 
Bruce of Cloves. (And that was a month before it was decided that it was to 
_be_ the "East Kingdom".) I was part of the "Population I" group who ran into 
these things by way of fandom (and ran into _that_ by way of the Tolkien 
Society).
    In short, don't tell me the Good Old Days are a figment; I REMEMBER  the 
Good Old Days.
    The Society was not responsible for my voracious interest in heraldry, but 
gave me a chance of doing something with it. I served as Brigantia for five 
years, and organized a real functioning College of Heralds in the kingdom for 
the first time. I was also responsible for the "attributed" ordinary, FABULOUS 
HERALDRY.
    
   My pursuit of historic dance has had to be largely outside the Society, due
where. Thank goodness for Bhala Jones
(Ananda Dancers), who took me in hand
in time to keep me from being intimidated out of the field.
   And it was the existence of the Guild which impelled me to take up astrology
seriously, as well as work as a practitioner in other forms of divination.
     I remain, etc.,

Greetings and felicitations, good gentles,

My name is Margaret Roxana MacDubhSidhe (mundanely Gretchen Miller).
I'm the dancemistress in training for the Barony March of the
Debatable Lands (mundanely Pittsburgh PA).  My interests include
dance, archery (just like everyone in the SCA, or at least the ones
with computer accounts...), costuming, ie garb, needle-arts, music,
and theatre (from the grunge end, not the glory end..).

I am looking for some good source books for garb/costumes.  I am
particularly interested in Italian (Florencian) Renaissance, 
11-14th C Spanish, and any period in period of Scottish, particlarly
womens.  Also, since I do hand sewing instead of machine sewing
(yes, I'm crazy..), does anyone know of any books about stitches
used for garment sewing? (No, I'm not crazy, something like this
DOES exist for victorian sewing..).  Thanks for any info.

Margaret aka Gretchen

What are some of your favorite SCA songs?  Period, filk,
period-sounding but really written last year, or anything
else is perfectly acceptable.  This is one of my favorite:
 
Lord of the Dance
(I'm fairly sure I got this from the An Tir Songbook.  Note 'fairly sure'
and not 'certain.'  It's fairly popular out here in the West.)
 
When she danced on the water and the wind was her horn
The lady laughed and everything was born 
When she lit the sun and the light gave him birth 
The lord of the dance first appeared on the earth
 
Chorus:
Dance, dance wherever you may be 
I am the lord of the dance said he
I live in you, you live in me
I lead you all in the dance said he
 
I danced in the morning when the world was begun,
I danced in the moon and the stars and the sun
I was called from the darkness by the song of the earth,
I joined in the singing and she gave me birth
 
I sleep in the kernel and I dance in the rain
I dance in the wind and through the waving grain
when you cut me down, I care nothing for the pain
in the spring I'm the Lord of the Dance once again
 
I dance at the circle when the flames leap up high
I dance in the fire and I never never die
I dance in the waves of the bright summer sea
I am the Lord of the waves' mystery
 
I dance at the sabbat when you dance out the spell
I dance and sing that everyone be well
When the dancing's over do not think that I am gone
To live is to dance, so I dance on and on
 
The moon in her phases, and the tides of the sea
the movement of the earth and the seasons that will be
are the rhythm of the dancing and a promise through the years
that the dance goes on through our joy and tears
 
the horn of the Lady cast its sound 'cross the plain
the birds took the notes and gave them back again
'til the sound of her music was a song in the sky 
to that song there is but one reply
 
they danced in the darkness, and they danced in the night
they danced on earth and everything was light
they danced out the darkness, and they danced in the dawn
and the day of the dancing still goes on
 
I see the maidens laughing  as they dance in the sun
and I count the fruits of harvest one by one
I know the storm is coming but the grain's all stored
so I dance the dance of the Lady and Her Lord
 
We dance ever slower, as the leaves fall and spin
and the sound of the horn is the wailing of the wind
the earth is wrapped in stillness and we move in a trance
but we hold on fast to our faith in the dance
 
the sun is in the southland and the days grow chill 
the sound of the horn is fading on the hill
the horn of the Hunter as he rides cross the plain
and the Lady sleeps til the spring comes again
 
the sun is in the southland and the days lengthen fast
and soon we will sing for the winter that is past
now we light the candles and rejoice as they burn
and we dance the Dance of the sun's return
 
I gaze on the heaven and I gaze on the earth
I feel the pain of dying and rebirth
I lift my head in gladness and praise for the day 
of the Dance of the Lord and the Lady gay

 To: Pat McGregor
 From: Erna-Lynne Bogue
 
 I must be asleep. This person is in Boston!! There's one of the
 absolute best ECD teachers in the world there, Helene Cornelius.
 And she leads dancing weekly, I think. Plus many other good
 teachers.
 
 If your friend calls Country Dance Society, Boston Centre, she
 can get info. Two people listes as contacts for Boston Centre's
 Pinewoods events are:
      Joe & Robin Kynoch
      500 Grove St.
      Framingham MA 01701 (617) 877-1168
 
      Sukey Agard (617) 648-3468
 
 Boston Centre does a lot of Pat Shaw dances (he was a *great*
 modern composer of dances in many styles, including early
 Playford). They also do the full repertoire of early Playford,
 and really know their stuff. She's living in the hot spot of ECD
 in the nation.
 
 (large repertoire? the last Country Dance Index listed over 2000
 dances, English & American -- and those are just the ones in
 printed, published sources, and doesn't include those that you
 get at places like Boston Centre where people are doing research
 & reconstructing from manuscript...)
 
 You might also tell your friend that CDSS also has a library of
 dance materials, including journals, notebooks, old copies of
 out-of-print books, etc and has been very involved in
 reconstructing especially early Playford and the baroque era
 dances. The library is in Reston Virginia, but materials can be
 photocopied & borrowed by mail. I've not been active in the
 reconstruction scene (two weeks of learning steps at Pinewoods
 convinced me I'd never be good at it), but Boston Centre and/or
 CDSS headquarters in Northampton could get her in touch with the
 folks who are.
 
 Pinewoods Early Music Week, including dance, is July 16-23 , that
 there are sometimes some scholarships available, and that it
 doesn't usually fill up too fast, but that registrations are
 going on now. May 1 was the "in before the lottery" deadline.
 
 Is this more than you wanted to know? If so, let me know and I'll
 be quiet about it.

dancing weekly, I think. Plus many other good teachers (and a few I find
less delectable, but still solid).
 
If your friend calls Country Dance Society, Boston Centre, she can get info.
Two people listes as contacts for Boston Centre's Pinewoods events are:
    Joe & Robin Kynoch
    500 Grove St.
    Framingham MA 01701 (617) 877-1168
 
    Sukey Agard (617) 648-3468
 
Boston Centre does a lot of Pat Shaw dances (he was a *great* modern
composer of dances in many styles, including early Playford). They also do
the full repertoire of early Playford, and really know their stuff. She's
living in the hot spot of ECD in the nation.
 
(large repertoire? the last Country Dance Index listed over 2000 dances,
English & American -- and those are just the ones in printed, published
sources, and doesn't include those that you get at places like Boston Centre
where people are doing research & reconstructing from manuscript...)
 
You might also tell your friend that CDSS also has a library of dance
materials, including journals, notebooks, old copies of out-of-print books,
etc and has been very involved in reconstructing especially early Playford
and the baroque era dances. The library is in Reston Virginia, but materials
can be photocopied & borrowed by mail. I've not been active in the
reconstruction scene (two weeks of learning steps at Pinewoods convinced me
I'd never be good at it), but Boston Centre and/or CDSS headquarters in
Northampton could get her in touch with the folks who are.
 
Pinewoods Early Music Week, including dance, is July 16-23 , that there are
sometimes some scholarships available, and that it doesn't usually fill up
too fast, but that registrations are going on now. May 1 was the "in before
the lottery" deadline.
 
Is this more than you wanted to know? If so, let me know and I'll be quiet
about it.

To:           Sca Discussion List <SCA@ai.ai.mit.edu>


   Torvald:

    First, the Disco Korobushka was simply the regular Korobushka done
  to a popular contemporary (almost disco) rock tune popular at the time
  (this was circa 1978-79).  If you notice, the dance can be done to any
  tune in 4/4 time, and it helps if the tune has phrases 12 measures
  long, but this really doesn't matter.

   Second, as to your description of Korobushka - very close to accurate.
  A few points of clarification, though.  First, it would be clearer to
  say that the lady stands to the lord's right.  Second, as in many line
  dances, Korobushka may be done in a circle, but it doesn't have to be.
  For the partner-changing version, it must be done in a circle, though.
  And lastly, about the switch (parts 4-8):  as I learned it, when
  returning from the spin the first time (part 4), the couple only takes
  right hands, not both.  This makes it easier to switch places (the lady
  still goes under their right arms).  Instead of two sets of push and
  pull, we only do one, probably a little slower (it takes one measure,
  4 counts to do one push and one pull).  The same is true for the second
  spin, except that here couples do take both hands, and when they
  change places, they end up back in position to begin again.

    The partner-change version is the same as the regular version,
  except that during the last spin out and back, the lady spins out from
  her partner, and back to the lord behind her now-former partner (which
  is why this version must be done in a circle).  The new couple take
  hands, pull and push, trade places, and begin the dance again.

    If anyone out there is interested in Moonshine (if you thought
  Korobushka was energetic, wait 'till you see Moonshine!), I'll be happy
  to post its steps.  The music to both Korobushka and Moonshine is
  fairly readily available on selected Russian folk or Balalaika tapes
  (although I wish I could find a really good version of Korobushka - I
  don't have access to the old Nordskogen version, and (if you recall my
  previous treatise on the dance climate in Bhakail) you should know that
  there's no source for it here).  Trust me - if you like Korobushka, and
  you like spinning dances, and you like folk-dance-ercize, you'll love
  Moonshine.

Subject:  Korobushka description


Greetings to all from Torvald of Jamtland.

I've seen 2 request for a description of the Korobushka & haven't seen a reply
yet so I thought I'd give it a try.  Keep in mind that I learned it last 
January, have danced it on only 2 seperate occasions, & do not specialize in
dance.

The Korobushka is a very energetic & flamboyant dance.  It is danced in a circle
of couples with the ladies on the inside & the couples facing counter-clockwise.To begin with, the couple holds their left hands together in front of them & 
their right hands behind the lady's head.  The steps are in sets of 4 so I will 
group them as such. The steps are as follows:

1: 2 steps diagonally to the right
   2 steps diagonally to the left

2: 1 step diagonally to the right
   1 step diagonally to the left
   The couple brings their right hands over the lady's head & turns to face each
     other so their right hands cross over their left hands.

3: The couple spins one full rotation to the right while moving away from each
     other (lords outward, ladies inward) ending the spin with a clap. 
 
4: The couple spins back together to the left & joins hands as before, right 
     crossing over left.

5: The couple pulls themselves together, then pushes themselves apart, then
     together again, then apart again.  

6: Next, the couple pulls themselves together, & the lord pulls the lady's left 
     arm, so she goes under their right arms & the lord & lady switch places, 
     now with their left hands crossing over their right.  This is done quickly,
     because the momentum from the switch is used to carry the couple into
     another spin away from each other as in set 3, just in the opposite
     ditection.

7: This set is exactly the same as set 5 except the couple spins to the right &
     joins hands with their left hands crossing over their right.

8: The couple does the same pull-push set as in set 6, except that in the last
     push, the lord pulls the lady's right arm so she passes under their left
     arms, rotating 270 degrees back to the beginning postion.  (Both facing
     forward, lady on the inside, left hands together in front, right hands
     together behind the lady's head.)

In set 8, on the last time through, instead of just spinning the lady back into
the original position, the lord pulls the lady's under their right arm, he 
kneels on left his left knee.  This allows the lady to sit down on the lord's
right knee when she has rotated to face the original way.  Then of course, as
with any good Russian dance, you throw up your hands & shout `Hay'.

It should be noted that the music starts at a nice brisk tempo, & speeds up
until its almost impossibly fast.

I'm not absolutely positive on the set where the couple switch places, but it
seems to work.

I hope that helped & was understandable.  Please forgive me if I've made any
errors.  I'm sure there's enough people out there that can correct me if I'm
wrong.


                          In Service to the Society,

Subject: Dancing in An Tir

Well, okay - if everyone is talking dance, I'll put my two bits in too.

In An Tir - at least here in Lions Gate - we do lots of English Country
Dance and some Italian Ren.  Altogether though, we don't seem to do nearly
as much dancing as you Eastern types do.  (Or at least there aren't as many
dancers on SCAnet from here as there are from there.)

Some names I remember off the top of my head: Hole in the Wall, Sweet Kate,
Strip the Willow (I hate this one), Gathering Peascods (sometimes called
Gathering Codpieces ;-) ), Sellingers Round sounds familiar, Juice of the
Barley, and assorted bransles.  I'm sure there are many more - I just don't
remember their names ("Everyone ready for Baroness's Bransle?" "Which one's
that? - Oh, where you do this then that.")  There don't seem to be any
hard-core Authenticity Dance Police here - we dance the ones we like.  

There seem to be more Russian-type dances out there too - what's
Korobushka?

Subject: Out of Period Dances

here in the Northern reaches of the Middle, we have the very good
fortune to have hooked up with someone who is primarily an
English Country Dance person and not a SCA person, but who is
very interested in researching ECD's back into our period. She
has done a lot of work on the roots of these dances, and has
taught a lot of what she has found at our workshops and events.
 
Also there are a whole crew of folks in the Northshield region,
particularly the folks in Jararvellir (Madison, Wis) who are
period dance crazy and who are working hard on acceptable
choreograph. We're trying to spread their efforts as far as
possible, through teaching and other distribution methods.
 
As far as music goes, the Northwoods (lansing, Mi) consort is
preparing a new dance tape, which looks like it will have lots of
marvelous and not overused dance music on it. Since these
musicians are at heart dancers, and understand the problems of
dancers, it should be a very worthwhile project. At this point
the initial cut of the tape has about 2 1/2 hours of music: I
expect it will get cut to more like 90 minutes before it's done.

Subject: Out of Period Dances

I know that different groups have very different attitudes about un-period
dances; indeed, the local attitude has changed a lot in the five years
since I joined.

Back when I first started dancing, out-of-period dances were *officially*
frowned upon, but no one really paid any attention to that. Hole in the
Wall was certainly one of the number one dances in the barony at the
time, and kidnapping was all the rage.

Lately, the attitude has changed a bit. Our repertoire has been steadily
expanding, and we're now at the point where almost no one can remember all
of the dances that *are* period. Therefore, we've been trying to slowly
move towards a more period repertoire. Hole in the Wall is taught only
rarely, and that mostly so that people know what they're doing when they
go out-barony. We're even trying to reduce our dependency on Playford
somewhat, since it's late period at best.

In place of the out-of-period stuff, we're trying to introduce some
more obscure period dances. We have about six or seven bassedances in
the repertoire now, and I'm trying to introduce new ones slowly. Also,
since we've got several members who've been around so long that they
regard *those* as too easy, we're beginning to work on some *really*
difficult dances, like 16th century canaries. Also, we've got a group
doing buffins (an ancestor of the Morris, I suspect). Geoffrey, you
want to describe the buffins a little?

As for made-up dances, that's a tangle. In principle, I have no problem
with dancing dances "in the period style". The problem is that very 
few of these dances seem to have been choreographed by people who
know the periods well enough to get something that's a *particular*
era. Thus, we wind up with bransles that have English Country moves in
them, Allemandes with Bransle movements, and so on. *This* I have a
problem with; this isn't making up new dances in period style, it's
making up a new kind of dance that is quite different. There are a few
that I've seen that looked to be pretty close to period, but not 
enough. Unfortunately, most of the people who are well-qualified to
make up "period-style" dances are violently opposed to the idea.

(Of course, I'm far from a perfect judge. I'd been under the impression
for quite some time that Maltese was entirely an SCA invention,
and was *quite* startled to find it in Orchesography. It's even 
pretty close to the way we dance it.)

In short, it's really up to the dancemaster's discretion. I just ask
that the dancemasters try to be well-informed. There really are a 
*lot* of period dances out there; we all have to work at getting
the knowledge of them around. And I ask that people really try to
make "made-up" dances bear a definite resemblance to some real
period; otherwise you just get a hash.

I am just joining the SCA after being a fringy person for about 12 years. 
My current roomy of 5 years is re-joining the society, and he and I and a 
few other people are thinking of working on some stuff to research historical
alchemy (REALLY historical alchemy, not the stuff revived and rewritten in
the 1800's by the various masons and occultists and suchlike).  Is anyone
else out there working on anything like this?  Do people have recommendations
as to sources?

As for my persona, I am going to be a Fiorenza of the mid to late 1400's 
named Sophia (Focino?  maybe), with a good education (academy).  I specifically
picked this period because it is the first time in Europe I know of that I
can be female, educated, and not a nun (until you go WAY BACK).  Lucky me, my

    Greetings, everyone.  Just thought I'd introduce myself, and respond
  a bit to the past day+'s worth of mail.  It's really interesting that
  of my three main activities in the Society are all represented in this
  first day of the mailing list.
    My name is Arglwydd Dafydd Cyhoeddwr (plus a household name that is
  as long as the rest and harder to pronounce).  I entered the Society
  (as Daragon von der Axte) in AS XII in the then Shire, now Barony of
  Three Rivers (mka St. Louis, MO).  Shortly after joining, I got
  interested in heraldry, and became quite proficient at the book end of
  that field with the help of the eventual first Falcon Herald of
  Calontir, Baroness (now Countess) Arwyn.
    Once school was over (plus a few years hanging on), I left St Louis
  to return home to New Jersey.  After a five year sabatical (except for
  two Pensics and First Crown of Calontir), I finally joined up with the
  group in Philadelphia, where I had since moved.  So now I reside in
  the new and improved Barony of Bhakail, Baileywicke Ivyeinrust.
    The East is very much different than the Middle or Calontir.  It took
  me a while to get used to the differences - and one of these
  differences was dance, my second vocation and now the one I do best
  (my heraldry has faded horribly).  Back in Three Rivers, I was Dance
  Master (for two weeks), and knew our entire repertoire (sp?) by heart -
  but then, we had perhaps a dozen or so dances, virtually none of which
  were english country (Sellingers Round was as Contra as we got).  In
  fact, because the music to Nonesuch (on the Nordskogen tape) was so
  beautiful, I created a mega-bransle to fit it because the dance was far
  too complicated for us.
    We also had a few non-period dances - Road to the Isles, Korobushka
  (and the bootleg Disco Korobushka), Troika, and another wonderful
  russian folkdance called Moonshine (Svetit Luna) - as well as the
  several SCA-choreographed dances like Manschaft Pavanne.
    When I returned to the SCA in Philadelphia, the first thing I got
  back into was dance.  What a shock!  I knew next to nothing about the
  dances done in the east - mostly because the bulk of Bhakail's rep. is
  either English Contry, weird Bransles I had never heard of before, or
  Bassa Dances (like Lauro, Kazzoul, and Touran).  And not one of them
  was out of period.  Our present Dance Mistress severly frowns upon
  anything that is not strictly period, including the SCA-invented ones.
    It took me a while to get used to this, a thing helped by the fact
  that I like to dance, and I was learning all sorts of wonderful dances
  (including that oh-so-difficuly Nonesuch, which really isn't).  My
  avid desire to do the russian dances and Manschaft is let out at
  Baileywicke Commons' and events, where I am the Dance Master and not
  only allow the fun dances, but actively encourage them.
    One thing I would like to know is - how does the rest of the Known
  Worlde feel about non-period-but-fun dances?  Obviously, from the
  mention of Korobushka (a russian folk dance done in a line, for which
  we developed a version that allowed partner-changing (the Disco version
  has no known creator)) here, there are people who do that dance.  I
  like it because it is rowdy and fun, and it's pseudo-period, which is
  more than enough for me.  How far will some of you go in getting fun
  dances for your people to do?  Back in Three Rivers, one of our dances
  was Strip the Willow - very non-period (done to Turkey in the Straw,
  in fact), but very entertaining.  I've heard much clammoring for it
  here in Bhakail, and in a few other groups, but Matilde (our Dance
  Mistress) goes into coniption fits if anyone mentions it in her
  presence.  (As an aside, does anyone know where to get some good music
  for Strip the Willow?  Lack of accompaniment is the only reason I
  haven't yet taught it to the Baileywicke.)
    Anyway, enough about dance.  My other two avocations are fencing and
  chroniclering (or something like that).  One of these days I will
  authorize as a fencer.  I have always wanted to fence in the SCA - it
  has distinct advantages over heavy-weapons fighting, among them the
  fact that I can actually fence with a minor degree of skill.  The
  Middle Kingom refused to even think about fencing (at least, they were
  that way up until about 5 or 6 years ago), so that was one of the nice
  differences about the East Kingdom.
     And lastly, I am about to become (any day now, really!) Bhakail's
  Chronicler.  I have never done a newsletter before, but I know several
  people who have, and who will be much help to me, I'm sure.  Still,
  it will be nice to be able to ask questions of people who have had
  serious experience with them here on this forum.

     Well, I think that that's long enough.  Farewell,

       Dafydd

All right, I've been hearing this word from enough different places that it
is clearly something that I should know about. *What*, prithee tell, is the
korobushka? It seems that almost everyone out there is dancing it, and I've
never even heard of it.

(Oh, yes, please people: check whether someone else has responded before you
do, lest poor Danulf get inundated by a dozen messages explaining the dance.)

Also, hello to all of the people joining us here. Hi Torvald -- glad you were
able to get through.

Subject:  Introduction, Dances, Wars, Stories, Elizabethian pesonas


Hello.  I'm Torvald of Jamtland, a Eastern Viking that's serving under Harald
Hardradi (Price Harald of Norway) in the Varangian Guard.  I'm bi-shiral.  I'm
attending college in the Shire of Rivenoak (CSU, Chico) & my lady, knight &
household are in the Provence of Golden Rivers (Sacramento), both in the
Principality of Cynagua, Kingdom of the West.

Someone already covered the dances popular out here, but last weekend at Beltane
Lady Lucina Sara Hawkridge & myself came up with one of our own (sort of).
On Sunday, there was a Peir d'Argent (sp?) contest for Rosewitha's Pavan, but
Lady Lucina & I wanted to practice the Korobushka.  So we came up with a
variation of the Korobushka, danced to the slow metered music of the pavan.
Since the normal Korobuskha is a very lively & flamboyant dance & ours was very
slow & methodical, we decided to call it the Death Korobushka.  Hopefully, next
time Rosewitha's Pavan is danced, we can get another line of dancers to dance
the Death Korobushka & really confuse some people.

As for unusual war stories, being from the same kingdom, I'm sure Coranna of 
Cavan has heard of the great Bambi War.  Apparently, after some event, a car
from the local Shire/Provence was behind a car from another Shire/Provence.
The car in the front accidently hit a deer & killed a deer.  The car from the 
local Shire/Provence saw this charged the offenders with poaching.  This of
course started a war.  I have no idea how the war turned out, but the next year
there was a rematch hosted by the original offenders called Thumper's Revenge.
Another war I heard about was fought over a road dit (one of the yellow bumps in
the road).  One was found missing on a road at the border of 2 groups (again I 
don't know where).  One group accused the other group of stealing the road dit &
said that if they were low enough to perform such an evil act, then their women 
& children would be next.  So they went to war.  Finally, I heard of a Scottish
fighter named Bryce from the Shire of Champ Claire (sp?) who came up with a
spell of Protection from Heavies for light fighters.  At last years Mist-Cynagua
War (AS XXI), he was being run down by a heavy.  The heavy cornered him, so he
shouted `You can't hit me, I don't have the Cheese.'  The heavy collapsed in
laughter, thus allowing Bryce to escape.

Finally, I am trying to come up with an Elizabethian or later period persona.
It doesn't have to be specifically English, just that time period.  My knight 
suggested that I be Agrippa Giseppi Sebastiani of York, an Italian that has 
realized how superior the English are so has moved to England & embraced 
Protestantism.  (This was mainly to annoy his lady who is Italian).  Since I 
don't seem to be getting much help within my household, I thought I'd ask for 
suggestions.  I'd prefer not to be French or Spanish (even though my lady is).
Since I already have a Scandinavian persona that has access to Russia & the 
Middle East, I don't want to have another one of those.  Which pretty much 
leaves England & Germany.  The persona is to be part of an Elizabethian pike
company my knight is putting together (which will be for hire in a few months
for anyone interested).  I'd also like to register a badge to be used the device
for this persona.  The field will be pally-bendy-bendy sinister sable & argent
(mudanely, diamonds split lengthwise, rightside black, leftside white).  I'm
looking for a charge to put on it.  If I do decide to go with Agrippa, I thought
of using some sort of Catholic symbol fracted (broken).  I don't want a cross
since that's both Catholic & Protestant.  I thought of a miter, but I don't
if that's exclusively Catholic.  Any ideas?

Thanx for wading through my rantings.


                          In Service to the Society,

                             Torvald of Jamtland

Subject: newsletters

Greetings to Siobhan and readers of the SCAnet.
(and three cheers for Danulf Donaldson, our moderator!)

I am Her Ladyship Elizabeth Braidwood, Editor of The North Wind (newsletter for
the Barony of Lions Gate in northern An Tir - for mundanities, see my .sig)
I have lived in the Current Middle Ages since early AS XX, and been editor for
7 months. Other interests: Bobbin Lace, Calligraphy.

Siobhan, may I present my thoughts on newsletters in general... I feel that the
primary purpose of a group newsletter is to distribute important and necessary
information in an accurate and timely manner.  If a newsletter lives up to
those three qualities (distribute information, accurately and timely) it can
be said to be serving its purpose. Think of a newsletter that contains only
event copy and an officers list.  If it is accurate and on time, it is useful.
After that, the newsletter should be informative and interesting. (Add event
chronicles, illustrations, book reviews, articles, notices to the populace and
the like.) And after all that, a newsletter could even be amusing.

I'd like to see the offices of Chronicler and Newsletter Editor held by two
separate people more often. I'd like to see more emphasis placed on the upkeep
of the Grete Bokes. I'd like to see more communication (trades?) between widely
distributed groups - both within kingdom and inter-kingdom. (One of the best
things I ever did was getting a subscription to a not-my-own-kingdom newsletter
,
Very Interesting.) I'd like to see a job description or guide for local group
newsletters.

Are there any Society policies concerning publications at the moment? 
I imagine that "publications" covers other forms of printed matter as well as
newsletters.


And are there any other Society Officers or BOD Members reading SCAnet?
The BOD will be meeing in Lions Gate (Vancouver BC Canada) in October, I
believe. I hereby offer my services as courier between those making the
arrangements and our autocrats.  My address is below.

Subject: More about dancing

This is the response I got from a friend when I forwarded that excellent
message about dance to her. She is a caller of no small repute in the midwest,
and has done lots of good teaching with the SCA folk. Well, enough of
my babble, on to the message

---(Forwarded from: Erna-Lynne_Bogue@um.cc.umich.edu, Dated: Mon, 2 May 88 16:26:04 EDT)---
 
Interesting. A dance repertoire one practice long? How deadly! Among
dedicated ECD'ers you can't do all the ones everyone knows by heart even
if you have 9 or 10 hours and don't call anything!  That explains quite
a bit...
 
Who's having trouble with HeartsEase? (And did you know that's the name of
David West & whomever, including no one, when he plays English CD)
 
 And while you're here I should tell you two things:
1) The flyer came from the historic dance folks in Maryland again.
2) CDSS has started a new "Library" rate for the CDSS Newsletter, which
includes their sales' dept stuff & listings of special events.  If SCA
has a budget for getting such things, or participates in Newsletter
exchanges, it might be worth getting.
 
            CDSS
            18 New South Street
            Northamptom MA 01060
 
Hmm...looking at the membership form, it's not a Library rate, it's a
News subscription rate -- $10 -- and carries no membership benefits.
 
Brief (teensy) response to the overall thing:
 
1) The Playford dances only seem simple because Playford assumed everyone
   knew the steps. Having danced them *with* steps I can say they're harder
   that way, but a lot. Also more elegant.
 
2) At least with country dances, if people teach basic figures & patterns
   of figures, instead of just particular dances, people can carry a much
   larger repertoire.  The impression I've had when I've talked with SCA
   dancers is that this way of looking at them doesn't happen much, possibly
   because that sub-pattern is lost in the midst of also carrying along the
   earlier dance types.
 
Enough of dance...I'm about to disassemble the computer to put up shelves
over it.

Subject: A reply to Dani Zweig's comments


Unto Dani of the Seven Wells (and any other dancers who may be listening),

Hi.  You bring up several interesting issues, which I'll talk about one 
at a time.

Re: going through the entire repertoire every dance practise. I fully 
sympathize. I've found that this happens a lot, and it tends to drive away
the more experienced dancers, due to simple boredom. The problem here
has been similar to yours, although not quite the same. Our repertoire is,
in theory, quite large. However, the *active* repertoire has tended to
be about one dance practise long, and changes only quite slowly.

I've been working on trying to rectify this, changing the line-up a bit each
week, but that has its drawbacks; if you introduce the dances too fast, it
tends to throw the less-confident dancers badly. I've found that one new
dance each week or two seems to work pretty well.

Re: not having enough period dances. Hmm. We have a bit of an advantage
here, in the form of Ingrid Brainard. Ingrid isn't SCAdian, but she is one
of the best researchers into period dance (particularly 15th and 16th
centuries) around, and she is pretty close friends with our Baron, Patri
du Chat Gris. Dances come from her reconstructions, get passed on to 
Patri via the Cambridge Court Dancers (a performance group that they
are in), he passes them onto the current dancemaster/mistress, and they
pass it onto the general populace. Also, Patri does some reconstruction
himself, when he has time. That's a simplified description, but
largely accurate. Recently, that chain has been cut down by the Master
Class, in which the most experienced dancers in the Barony paid Ingrid
to run an intensive ten-session class in period dance. It was a fascinating,
though painful, experience. She ran it as a serious dance class, with 
forty-five minutes of warm-ups followed by an hour-and-a-half of solid
dance (and trust me, 1 1/2 hours of canaries *hurts*).

The basic problem, I guess, is simply that the 15th and 16th century
dance books are very hard to read and reconstruct from. For the later
stuff, we have Arbeau and Playford, who spell the dances out in about
the right amount of detail. The earlier manuscripts, though, tend to:
a) make lots of assumptions that are no longer valid about what people
know, and b) be completely impossible to read. Thus, a simple translation
isn't good enough. You have to have an expert deciphering the text, to
try and figure out what the author was trying to get at.

My best recommendation, I guess, would be to try to find Ingrid's written
work. I'm pretty sure that she has written a bit, although I'm not sure
what form it takes. I'll ask Patri if he has any pointers about where
one might find her reconstructions.

Re: performance pieces. Well, this has long been a point of contention
between the SCA and Ingrid. The fact is, most interesting dances of the
15th century, and a lot of the 16th, were performance pieces. They were
intended to be danced by one couple before the Presence. We have generally
*done* them as ensemble dances, though, because they are fun. They
really aren't that hard to teach; my dance practise is about 3/4 college
students, mostly freshmen and sophomores, and most of them are pretty
decent at the bassedances and ballos. (I'm about to reintroduce Verceppe;
Ingrid has changed the reconstruction, and I'm trying to spread the
corrected version). If you can convince people that they are capable
of these dances, you'll probably find that they are. The big hurdle is
just getting people to stop saying, "No *real* person could dance Lauro".

Well, the above problems seem to boil down to lack of sources. I'll
see what I can do, but most of our dances come from an oral tradition.
I'm willing to write up some plain-English directions to the bassedances,
but I suspect that directions without some amount of one-on-one teaching
won't work. Hmm. I wonder if someone in Ostgardr (or somewhere similarly
central) would be willing to sponsor a dance symposium? Getting together
a good fraction of the dancemasters of the East to talk and teach each other
would be a first step towards improving the situation. If it works, we can
see about continuing the idea on a larger scale, and compare dances with 
the rest of the world. Communication is the point here.

Here's an idea. If no one steps forward to host a symposium, how about getting
together at the war? We could hold an informal gathering, for dancemasters
(or, at least, really dedicated dancers) only, in order to keep the size
manageable. How many intense dance types are going to be at Pennsic? Do
you think that holding such a session would be worthwhile? I'd be happy
to try and organize it (it would give me something to do at the War other
than spend eight hours a day at the butts and four hours a night listening
to Clan Cambian).

(God, I don't believe it -- I'm volunteering for *another* thing.)

Re: misc stuff. What problems are you having with Heart's Ease? I didn't
find the Playford ambiguous, but I already know the dance to some extent,
so I may be making assumptions. I can, at least, tell you how we're doing
it up here.

As for fun dances driving out dull ones, I know what you mean. I've been
encountering problems with people "spicing up" some of the moderate ones.
For example, I've been forced to kill off Gathering Peascods for the
moment, because so many people were being so rowdy with the dance that it
simply wasn't *safe* anymore.

I don't know any particular choreographed galliards, though I can ask Patri.
I general, we just make up a choreography if we need one. I've generally
found that if you just start people on free galliards, introducing the
steps gradually, most people don't have too much trouble making it up
as they go along.

Well, this letter has already been unreasonably long, so I'll stop. Send
me opinions about the dance symposium idea, okay? I think that it would 
really help a pretty bad communication situation.

Well, so far it looks like a lot of people in Pittsburgh, Boston and
the Bay Area have net access.  Not too surprising!  And I already know 
a fair number of the people who have posted so far.  Still not
surprising!  But I'll introduce myself before I go any farther (and
those of you who know me may actually be mildly surprised as I reveal 
some of my SCA history; not something I trot out very often at all . . .)

My Society name is Marian Greenleaf and I am currently the Seneschale
of the Barony-Marche of the Debateable Lands (the Pittsburgh area.)  I
went to my first event in Dearneheld (in the Midrealm; Athens, Ohio) in
A.S. X.  For a number of years I was only a lukewarm Scadian, due to
some fundamental philosophical differences with most of the rest of the
members of what was quite a small and insular shire.  My first persona
was Jeanne du Bel-Pommier, a 14th-century French peasant.  People
couldn't pronounce that name, so eventually I Anglicized it to Apple
Joan, but they still called me Marion.  When I moved to the East, I
gave up and took my present name and persona (late 15th-century English.)

During the first half of my SCA existence, I found that practicing the
arts openly caused friction with others, so I took to doing them
more or less secretly, in the company of a few friends.  I became 
a merchant in AS XV, selling my embroidery to pay the utility bills.  
(That is a good way to end up burned out on embroidery!)

Then my household and I moved to Atlantia, near the Shire of Isenfir,
but for a couple of years we didn't make contact with the Shire--our
previous experiences had not convinced us that it would be worth the
effort.  By the time we got around to it, two of us were fairly
accomplished artisans; it was a relief to discover that this didn't mean
instant ostracism.  In fact, the Shire was nearly dying, and we set
about helping to find new members and re-vitalizing it--but just as 
this was starting to get off the ground, (A.S. XVII) I decided to move to
Pittsburgh, for mundane reasons.

The boyfriend that I moved here to live with (now my fiance), and many
of the people that I met here through him, were and are active
Scadians.  I found the BMDL to be an open and friendly group, not very
hidebound, not at all heavy with peers, and full of interesting people.
I became deputy Minister of Arts in short order (since someone was
needed to do the paperwork end of things) and have not slowed down
since.  After my previous SCA experience, the BMDL was incredibly open
and enthusiastic.  I will always be grateful for this!

Although I have been pretty thoroughly sidetracked into administration,
I have many active interests in the arts and sciences.  Among them are
illumination (I am an East Kingdom scribe), poetry, vocal music, period
cookery (and the use of period botanicals generally), and medieval
buildings and building techniques.  I have taught classes on most of
these subjects, and also on autocratting and suchlike.

Encouraged by the acceptance of female fighters here, I decided to find
out why rattan was so fascinating, and authorized several years ago.
I am not very good, except in melees, but it's fun.  I also shoot
archery, at which I am solidly mediocre (even when in practice.)

I enjoy performance dance, and a few years ago (before our current
Dancemaster, Dani (who has introduced himself here) joined) we used to
do a fair amount of it here.  But some of the regulars moved, and
others (like me) took on increasingly heavy administrative duties and
had to cut out a lot of other activities.  I think that dance, like so
many other SCA things, goes in cycles and that in a couple of years it
will be more interesting to be a dancer here.  The notion of soliciting
dance advice on the net is wonderful!

After all these years, I am still enthusiastic, still fairly trusting,
and still a dedicated artist, with or without the SCA.  The SCA has
given me many true friendships and opportunities to grow.  I try to
pass along such benefits to others in my SCA career.

Mundanely, I have been an artifical intelligence researcher at
Carnegie-Mellon University for the past four years.  Last year I
enrolled in a PhD program in Computational Linguistics, and my job
became my assistantship.  The first year of grad school has been a very
interesting thing to mix with being Seneschale, and I find that I am
not unhappy that my term of office will be up this summer.

I have opinions on heraldry, too, but they are perhaps not as
reasonable as they should be (though I bear no grudges against any
individuals.)  One of these days, I am sure that I will design a device
that  a) will not get bounced at the Laurel level  b) I will like  and
c) the local herald will actually submit instead of losing.  After all,
I've only been trying for four years.

All in all, I figure that since I allow myself the luxury of being
snotty about poetry (and I am, though not about much else--but I may be
corrected on this point by some other gentle, I suppose ;-), I should
allow that the heralds may be snotty about heraldry.  There is really a
fair amount of practical justification for keeping heraldy "pure."  I
just happen to find some of the process to be unnecessarily arbitrary.

I think this list is a great idea, even if it fills my mailer up faster
than I can keep track of it all.  Thank you, Danulf, for setting it up.
Looking forward to "meeting" a lot of nice folks!

In-Reply-To: <8804291708.AA13021@inmet.inmet.com>

Hi Justin,

        Pleased to meet you.  I'm Dani of the Seven Wells.  I'm the current
Dancemaster for the Barony Marche of the Debateable Lands (Mundanely
Pittsburgh).  My interests include music (vocal and instrumental), dance and
archery.

Our entire dance repertoire consists (for practical purposes) of less than 40
dances, most of which we do semi-regularly.  (It's a problem:  the same dances
get done every week.)  A breakdown of these dances (I could dig up specific
titles) is revealing:

Period Non-English (Bransles, etc.):  About half a dozen.
Period English Country:  About half a dozen.
Non-Period English Country: About a dozen.
SCA choreographies:  About half a dozen.
International Folk Dances:  About half a dozen.

(I should distinguish between dances which the regular dancers do and dances
which get pulled out at events so that even the people who almost never dance
can dance.  The latter list is much shorter:  Bransle d'officiale, Carolingian
Pavan, Earl of Salisbury Pavan, Hole in the Wall, Horses Bransle, [SCA] Maltese
Bransle, Sellenger's Round, Gae Gordons, Korobushka.)

An obvious question suggests itself:

a)  Why so few Period dances?

As far as the non-English dances are concerned, there doesn't seem to be that
much material (suggestions would be appreciated!) that falls between the boring
basic dances (double to the left, double to the right, repeat ad infinitum) and
dances which seem to be primarily meant as performance pieces (Verceppe,
Genevra).

As for the English Country dances, fun dances drive out dull ones, and the
later ones tend to be more fun.  (This may also have something to do with why
more people get up to do Korobushka than Staines Morris :-)

Making matters somewhat worse, we currently have a dancemaster who isn't
finding time to research new period dances.  (Can anyone suggest some good
references?  I recently tried to pull out Heart's Ease, for example, but we
couldn't disambiguate the Playford instructions.  And I didn't want to just go
with a best-guess, because we do enough dances differently from the rest of the
known world already as it is.)

(Also, can anyone suggest a good choreographed galliard?  I think many people
would enjoy galliarding who wouldn't feel up to improvising to music.)

      And there is more to it than this, for dancing is practised to
reveal whether lovers are in good health and sound of limb, and
after which they are permitted to kiss their mistresses in order that
they may touch and savour one another, thus to ascertain if they
are shapely or emit an unpleasant odour as of bad meat.  Therefore,
from this standpoint, quite apart from the many other advantages to
be derived from dancing, it becomes an essential in a well-ordered
society. -- Thoinot Arbeau (1588)

Greetings all!
My name is Siubhan NicCruimein, mundanely known as Jennifer Pelland.  I am a 
mild mannered Wellesley sophomore by day, anachronist by night.  I belong to    :
	the East Kingdom (North East U.S.)
	
	Barony of Carolingia (the Greater Boston area)
	Burough of Felding (Wellesley College)
Currently, I am the Provost (Grand Poobah) of Felding, but when the semester
ends, so does my term of office.

My interests include dancing, archery, Scottish garb-making, and Foolery.  I 
am a member of the fledgling, hopefully soon to be official Fools Guild of
Carolingia.

There are two things I would really like to know, and I hope you all can help
me with them.  Firstly, I would like to hear from other college groups, to see
how you handle your own group and the college administration (which isn't 
usually very easy)  If you can give me ideas for interesting demos, things not
to do at demos, creative ways to get people to join, things that went 
disasterously wrong when you held an event on campus, etc...  I'd love to hear
from you.  Give me the good as well as the bad, so we can learn from your 
mistakes as well as your sucesses.

Secondly, I will be spending my junior year (next year!) abroad in Spain.  I 
haven't been able to find any evidence of the SCA in Spain.  I know it exists
in England and Germany, but I'd really like to find a group a little closer
to the Pirannes.  I don't think a French group would help me any, as I don't
speak the language.  If anyone has any information, PLEASE contact me ASAP.

All correspondence must be received by May 27th, because after that, I go home
for the summer, then go to (gulp) Spain.  (I guess I'd better learn to speak
Spanish really soon now).

Reply-To: joshua@paul.rutgers.edu


Greetings to all from Arval Benicoeur, Brigantia Principal Herald.

In response to my suggestion that we start a discussion of matters
heraldic on this net, I have received many letters, and I thank you
all.  In general, do people think that such discussions should be
dealt with as separate mailing lists, or broadcast through Lord
Danulf's SCAnet?

I received the following (editted):

From Lady Coranna of Cavan of the Province of the Southern Shores,
Principality of the Mists:

   I'm particularly interested in visual differencing, as this is a 'grey
   area'.  (feel free to post this if you think it would be of general
   interest)  For example, two devices were passed, as:

   Sable, a winged fox rampant within a bordure argent    and
   Purpure, a winged fox rampant to sinister within a bordure argent.

   The black one passed first, and its bearer (Eric Foxworthy) met the 
   bearer of the second device on the field at Pennsic.  From a distance, 
   he said, it looked exactly like his own, as the purple was very dark.  
   These two devices have a clear two points of difference, but Eric argues
   that rampant and rampant to sinister do not have a sufficient visual
   difference for the second device to have passed.  Arguing past history
   may not be useful, but I wanted another Herald's opinion.

   Coranna of Cavan, Sea Wolf Scribe (sun!quintus!laurie)


The Rules for Submission to count sufficient difference between these
arms.  The basic requirement is, of course, two major points of
difference.  Tincture of field and posture of the beast each count for
a full point.

I agree that the rampant & rampant reversed do not really differ by a
full visual point, and, indeed, I have been trying for some time to
convince the College of Arms.  In medieval armory, there does not
seem to have been any difference accorded for dexter/sinister
mirroring: frequently in works of art, the same set of arms will be
found facing both ways.  For example, on alterpieces, arms such as
"Gules, a bull rampant Or" would be shown on both sides of the central
panel, with both bulls facing inward.  Artists found this more
appropriate, and there is no reason to belive that heralds considered
this to change the arms in any way.  From a more practical standpoint,
if you make a good banner or standard with your arms on it, then you
certainly want the charges on both sides, and you clearly want both
your beast facing to the front as you ride onto the field...

In my opinion, the only time that we should accord any difference for
the direction a charge is facing is when there is some other element
of the design which reinforces the asymettry.  For example, "Argent,
two wolves combattant azure" and "Argent, two wolves rampant addorsed
azure" clearly differ by a point.

The College is currently reviewing the methods used to count
difference, and one of the proposed revisions would do away with this
distinction.  If you think this is a good idea, my Lady, I urge you to
write to the lady Laurel Queen of Arms.  She is even now preeparing a
revised draft of the Rules for Submission, and would appreciate all
input.  Your example is an excellent illustration of how our Rules
fail.


Yours in discussion,

Arval / Brigantia.

Reply-To: joshua@paul.rutgers.edu


To Coranna of Cavan, From Arval Benicoeur, Greetings!

Your comment about the cattle raids caught my eye.  A few years ago in
Rusted Woodlands (Nothereastern NJ), we had a battle at our event
which we called "The Pig Raid of Cooley".  In it, two small forces,
representing the peace-loving farmers and the fiercesome raiders,
battled for possession of a small leatherette pig (complete with
ears!).  In teams of 11 men, the raiders tried to move the pig off the end of
the field of battle, for which they would be credited with enouhg pork
to feed seven.  Alternatively, they could try to kick the pig over the
barn, which demonstrated it to be a rather small pig, only enough to
feed three.  After four salleys with the pig, the two forces switch
roles...

You get the idea?  It was a gneral success, just silly enough, and
lots of bashing.

Subject: Salutations!

First off, by way of introduction, I am a (formerly) Bavarian
wanderer named Christof the Pathfinder, who's interests include
music, dance, calligraphy, cartography, and avoiding a certain 
Bavarian noble with no sense of humor (see previous parenthesies.) 
I'm presently living in the Barony Marche of the Debatable Lands, 
where I've been hanging about the College of Cour D'Or for several 
years.  Mundanely, I'm a third year undergrad at Carnegie-Mellon 
University in Pittsburgh, PA  (Computer Engineering, if you wondered
- but that will change soon.)

Second, I am presently looking for anyone out there who has done
any work with cartography (mapmaking) as a period art form.  I've
been looking at a large number of sources lately, and it seems like
there should be a lot of skill transfer from more "conventional"
illumination and carpet page work, so I'm wondering what (if
anything) has already been done.  Any other cartographers out there 
who can give an aspiring novice suggestions?  Anyone else who thinks 
this sounds potentialy neat who'd like to trade research notes?  
Anyone, for instance, who can point me at color reproductions of the 
Peutinger Table, for instance, will earn my most undying gratitude 
and highest praise, but I'd be interested in just hearing what other 
folks think.

Greetings to the good gentles of the Knowne World from Siobhan Medhbh O'Roarke,
Society Chronicler.
 
Good gentles! how lovely to have this method of converse at our fingertips.
 
I'm mostly writing today to let you know I'm here, accept this method of converse
as "official" for transacting SCA business (altho I slomail hardcopy
to the Steward and my ombudsman), and like to talk about newsletters and
the role our communications have in the Society as a whole. So, here's
my first question:
 
What do our newsletters, either Kingdom or local, do for the Society?
What function *should* they serve? How can we make them better? What policies
should the Society adopt towards publications that can make them serve us
better?
 
here's to Our Society!

Subject: Dance, history, & discussion

I'm pleased to meet you, Justin.  I'm Coranna of Cavan.  I am the Scribe 
for the Principality of the Mists (San Francisco Bay Area).  I am
interested in fighting, scribing, brewing, dancing, and having a good
time in garb.  I've been SCA for four years or so, in the Province of
Southern Shores (San Jose Ca.).   In the past year or so, I have seen 
a great deal of pavanning (?), bransling (??), and Hole in the Wall,
though not strictly period, is rising in popularity.  At least one 
member of pied d'argent (West Kingdom dance order) has invented a new 
pavanne.  I was in the lists when the dance was performed, but I'm told 
it was great fun.  

In answer to Lord Justin's second topic, yes, the SCA has gone through
a lot of mundane and not-so mundane changes, many of which make for
terrific storytelling.  There is often a class on 'the bad old days'
held at West Kingdom Collegiums, covering the first five years of the
society.  I like to ask 'oldtimers' about the evolution of armor 
standards, the influence of certain dukes on fighting styles, and what
went on at early tourneys.  I'll see what interesting anecdotes I can
dig up.  [The King who outran his bodyguards, Duke Angus at Pennsic, 
Eric Foxworthy and the ducks, Trimarian excuse practice, the way
Jay d'Argent killed two men with one blow, etc.]

In the spirit of prompting further discussion, I'd like to hear from
some of the fighters out there.  What are some interesting or unusual
battles and wars you've been to or heard of?  The Principalities
of the Mists and Cynagua held a cattle raid at their annual war.  Yes,
large unwieldy burlap cows that you had to steal or defend.  They moo
when moving; the Princess said so.  The legs were detachable too, and
a dismembered cow wasn't worth as much as a whole one.  It was very
silly, and a great deal of fun.  There was a prize given for the best
mooing of the day.  What unusual events have you been to lately?

Subject: Hi there!


Greetlets!

Things seem to be pretty quiet here, so I thought that I would introduce
myself, and try to get a discussion started up.

My name is Justin du Coeur (my SCAdian name, that is; I generally use that
in any interesting company). I am the Dancemaster for the Barony of
Carolingia (in the Northern Region of the East Kingdom, mundanely Boston).
My interests include dancing (obviously), archery, storytelling, acting,
and general administrivia. I've been in the Society for about 4 1/2 years,
most of that in the Burrough of Fenmere (mundanely, Brandeis University),
a sub-group of Carolingia.

First topic of discussion: what are people dancing out there? I've travelled
some, but only in this general area (ie, North and Central EK). Are people
doing English Country? Modified modern folk dance? Bransles and Allemandes?
Is *anyone* outside the East doing bassedanse and ballo (Italian and Burgundian,
15th century)? Dance seems to be one of those subjects where there hasn't
been all that much communication; let's see what we can do about it.

Second: recently, I've started noticing just how much history the Society
has racked up in its twenty-odd years of existence. Some of the older
members of our Barony have started telling the basic history of
Carolingia at post-revels and the like, so that the new members have some
sense of continuity, and just the outline takes several hours. Thus,
I'm starting on a project to redact some of the oral history of the group.
Since this is a distinctly disorganized project, I might as well include
other groups as well. Thus, send me your history, your anecdotes, anything!
Who knows, someday you may find your story in print (assuming this ever
coalesces into anything readable). Any sort of interesting story is
welcome (if anyone can give me the *definitive* origin of the line,
"I'll see your six inches and raise you thirty", I would be most 
grateful; guesses need not apply). Mail them to me, or post them to
the mailing list; I'd bet that we'll find *many* different versions
of some stories.

Hmm. Does anyone know of a good version of Hypertext for the PC, so
I can try to organize this mess?

Well, anyway, let's get some discussion rolling! The society is nothing
if not a social creature, and I'm sure that people have more things
to talk about than just dry announcements!

Subject: SCA DISTRIBUTION OUT OF SCA@AI.AI.MIT.EDU

SCA DISTRIBUTION is now an unmoderated SIG on the ARPA net.  Redistribution
is now automated out of AI.AI.MIT.EDU.  To post information to SCAnet 
participants just send mail to:

SCA@AI.AI.MIT.EDU

The purpose, as I have stated earlier, is to encourage communication,
especially to exchange ideas and research, within the SCA community from
coast to coast (and across the ocean, we hope).  Presently, information 
is passed more by hearsay than by fact.  Corporate publications can 
assist with overall informational dissemination, but they cannot explain what
is going on with rapier combat in the East kingdom as well as an East 
Kingdom fencer.  Nor, can they provide the instant feedback that networks
provide.  Hopefully, this will become an area and forum for controversial
thought as well as timely information.

Let us help it grow.  Please inform fellow SCAdians and have them contact the 
moderator at:

SCA-REQUEST@AI.AI.MIT.EDU

The moderator is Danulf Donaldson, aka: Dana Groff.

Please send node information in ARPA format and include the following 
information, if possible:

1) society name:
2) mundane name:
3) kingdom, group (and/or mundane location):
4) titles:
5) interests (brief):
6) do you want to be on the mailing list (y/n):
7) do you want to allow your node_address and information to be passed 
   onto other SCAdians (members of this list) (y/n):
8) node address (ARPA preferred):

I do not have this much information on many of you... so, please help me update
my information.  POINT 7 is important... your privacy is a concern.  I may 
one day wish to distribute my information, if you DO NOT WISH to have other
members of this mailing_list know of your address, then I will gladly keep it
quiet.  There are others who may wish to have people write to them directly,
but do not want to partake in any mailing lists, for this I have added point
6.

You may want to post an introduction to the conference as well.  The above
information should be sent to SCA-REQUEST.  It will not be redistributed to 
the conference.  If you wish to announce your existance and introduce yourself,
PLEASE DO... send that to the conference address at SCA@AI.AI.MIT.EDU.

USAGE NOTES:

Mail is redestributed as if you sent to each member on the list.  
SCA@AI.AI.MIT.EDU is not in the "from" field, so just replying to a note will
NOT send that note to the many members of the conference.  Further, if there
is ever networking trouble, YOU will receive the errors, not the moderator.
If you receive "failed mail" messages, please forward them to SCA-REQUEST.

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO DISTRIBUTE THIS LETTER

In service to the society,

Lord Danulf Donaldson, aka Dana Groff
