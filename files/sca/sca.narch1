SCA slang

i was much amused by slang I hadn't run into before, and now feel compelled to
contribute my own versions of the slang. 

BRASS HAT:  anyone entilted to wear a coronet or crown , derived from US
military slang, where the original brass hat refers to officers (who have gold
braid on their caps)
TIN CAN: someone who has armor so good he can't feel blows
CAN OPENER: someone who can hit hard enough for tin cans to accept blows from
him.
SILVER TAPE: what holds the world together
KING THING: any royalty that is overly impressed by the fact that it is royalty
SCABUM: somebody who is thoroughly immersed in SCA, to the detriment of his
ability to function in the mundane world
MASHER: a man who doesn't understand the meaning of the word "no".  The only
way to get rid of these cads is to phsyically throw them out, and then slam the
door quick before they scoot back in.
DRAGON: (Midrealm and Atlantia) automobile
WAGON: automobile
MUSHROOM: dome shaped nylon tent
LOBSTER SHELL: hard back or breast armor
UNGENTLEMAN: a gentleman who isn't
CHAINMAIL MAMA: a woman fighter
RABBIT: a male whose costume seems to be made out of the skin of one rabbit
BUNNY: a female whose costume seems to be made out of the skin of one rabbit
WEEKEND WARRIOR: SCA fighter who isn't as dedicated to SCA combat as the guys
with the white belts. Derived from US miltary slang for members of the National
Guard
ERIC: border of the fighting area (we use it in Atlantia all the time, Arval)
BRASS MOUTH: herald
SUPERDUKE: someone who's been king three times or more
SUPERDUKES OF THE WEST: the quasi-legendary great fighters, the only one whom
anyone can think of by name being Paul of Bellatrix, but conveying the idea
that the West is chocked to the gills with mega fighters.
WENCH: any male or female that serves feasts
WOLFGAR: anyone who is so dedicated to the possession of cutlery that he
clanks when he moves.
WOLFGARISH: paranoid
TO ARCH: to do archery
ATROCITY: a well known tune that has had its words rewritten to give a humorous
version of SCA or Science Fiction fandom.   
ALPHABET SOUP: the jumble of letters that follow the names of people who've
gotten a lot of awards, also refers to the individuals themselves.
NEO: neophyte, a newbie, a new member 
PELL: a fighter with an inadequate defense who just can't seem to get the hang
of what he's supposed to be doing.

Well, that's all I can think of for now.  Some of it is local, some of it I've
run across frequently.

Subject: date rape revisted

Date Rape and men

Nagaseru brings up thte point that many techniques used by mashers on ladies
can also be used by (what does one call a woman who does such things, certainly
not "lady") by ladies on men.  I was speaking fromt he personal experience of
myself and my female friends, but once, long ago a gentleman confided in me
about such an epxerience, this assailant did him physical injury in addition to
major head games.  Nagaseru's point is thus very well taken.  And another
point, men are often more humiliated by such encounters than women are because
they feel it not only attacks their body, but their manhood as well, and often
people feel that is a man allows himself to be victimized in this way, then he
isn't much of a man, and who cares?  I therefore suspect that far fewer men
ever report to authorities, or even tell their friends about such incidents,
than women.  With all the people we have on the Rialto, odds are their are male
victims among them, but nobody's talking, which is a demonstration of just how
taboo this subject is.

Nagaseru also puts forward some very useful techniques for defending yourself
from unwanted advances that take place in reasonably public places.  Private
places (you crash at somebody's house, and he spends the night trying to tie
 you up, this happened to me) where there's nobody
to help you, and if you have no transportation and are in a strange town, you
have no place to go.  I've thought for a long time that it would be wise to
have a SCA emergency access number listed in telephone book.  I heard a rumour
that some people would list their phone number under the name "Richard
Lionheart" so that SCA folk could find  a willing contact.  An emergency
contact would be a person willing to take calls in the middle of the night to
rescue stranded motorists, crashers who found their host intolerable, or
whatever.  

At large camping events, a hospice of some sort could be available to anyone
who needed it: their tent flooded, they discovered the loaned space they were
using to be inadequate, they were having a fight with their tentmate, they were
drunk and couldn't find their way home, etc.  In period, Hospitals run by the
Hospitallers of St JOhn provided resting places for pilgrims, well as medical
services.  A few years ago Aaron the Black had a hospitaller persona and was
doing just this.  He was also a mundane paramedic and boyscout master, so he
had extra tents and the medical skills to do so. It seems a logical expansion
of the chirurgeon's office to provide these additional services.  It seems a
logical extension of chirurgeon training to provide chirurgeons with basic
skills in coping with emotionall disturbances as well.  I've had to calm down
hysterical people at Pennsic, fortunately my mundane training covered such
subjects, but not all chirurgeons training does.  On the other hand, I am not
qualified to deal with a victim of attempted rape, beyond making sympathetic
noises and holding hands.  (I've done that too, but mundanely, not in SCA)

We have taken upon ourselves the burden of creating a new society, and not
merely confining ourselves to the usual acitivities of an educational
organization.  By making our society we have to address social needs: people
get married in the SCA, something that does not happen in our mundane
counterparts.  And we also have all manner of other personal ties, and personal
problems, ranging from alcoholism to spouse abuse, to date rape.  Now we must
also shoulder the burden of serving very real human needs, and not just the needs of
the "current middle ages".

SCA is a very important part of our  members lives, why else would they invest
so much time, money and effort into it?  As such it is not merely a playacted
reenactment of another time, it is a real society on its own merits. We know
that we are different from the mainstream, just as a Jew knows he is different.
We are a recognizable cultural minority with a distinctly identifiable set of
customs and beliefs that differ from the the host society in which we find
ourselves. We find ourselves with special difficulties in coping with
representatives of that society who do not understand us, and we must take
steps to fulfill needs that the host society cannot adequately address in our
special melieu.     

Our institutions must evolve to satisfy the needs of the membership, or else we
must make a definite and offical effort to elimate our "society" and reduce to
to the level of a club.

Subject: why don't more women fight


Why Don't More Women Fight:  

Several reasons.  Firstly, I think women in the United States are brought up to
be less physical than men are, so its takes a lot more work for the average
woman to achieve mediocrity.  She not only has to learn how to swing a sword,
she must also enmbark upon an exercise plan to develop the muscles to do so.
This is a lot of work and dedication, and  the rewards are a long way off
compared to the average beginning guy.  A lot of women drop out in frustration.
Weight requirements work agaist womena as well.  In some places, shields must
weigh a certain minimum, also in all places beginning fighters must learn sword
and shield first.  For  a lightly muscled woman, its a tall order to wave one of
those heavy shields around, and she'd got no choice.  She may want to pick up a
weapon form more appropriate to her physical abilities, such  as bastard sword,
but she can't do what she wants to do and is competent to do until she's gotten
authorized in sword and shield.  

Second, women in the United States are raised to be gentle, kind, and
sensitive.  Women are trained in passivity and peaceful resolution of conflict.
Women are protected from competetion.  I took fencing in high school.  Having
guys bigger than myself lunging at me was definitely unnerving.  They ran their
female opponents all over the gym in spite of the fact that all were equally
rank novices.  I got tired of being pushed around and getting bruises on my
breasts, and started pushing back.  And suddenly, I was the only one the guys
wanted to fight.  "You're the only woman that's any fun to play with" they said. 
 I watched the other women, fought the other women with my new aggression, and
understood what they meant.  I could push them all over the gym.  They didn't
like it  and dropped out. Fighting means accepting the idea that you could do
other people harm and not worrying about it.  Most women are terribly afraid of
hurting people.  What could be more unfeminine, more unmotherly, more rude than
hurting somebody? This is why the average woman makes a great victim for
criminals.  The haven't the learned the desire to run somebody through and make
'em bleed.  

And then their is the matter of armor.  Women need rigid breast protection
because the breasts are an awfully tender piece of anatomy.  Bruising a woman
in the breast does not produce the same crippling effect of hitting a guy in
the crotch, but it still hurts a *lot*.  Fencing armor is real inadequate at
covering this tender area, it was my major reason for quitting fencing.  My
guard was good, but I had this one hole: right breast and armpit.  So when I
got hit, I got hit there.  Ouch.  Definitely a reduction in my enthusisiam.
Especially when I saw how much the catalogs wanted for little round metal
things that wouldn't do the job.  The obvious thing is to learn to improve my
guard, but that takes practice, and practice brings bruises, and I'm right
handed, those bruises hurt whenever I try to do my mundane activities.  

Attitudes are changing.  Younger women are more aggressive than their mothers
were, I think there's quite a few women who would like to partipate in SCA
combat, I know I would, but I just haven't got the patience and facilities to
undertake the program of bodybuilding it would require.  Light weapons and
archery have much larger proportions of women than heavy weapons.  This is one
of the reasons I 'd like to see light weapons and archery put on an equal
footing with rattan combat.  A woman can more readily aquire the physical
requirements to fence or arch than she can rattan fight.  Likewise, these
skills offer less violation of the engrained idea "don't hurt anybody" than
rattan fighting does, and so its easier to develop the mindset necessary for success
in these skills.  Also, they're cheaper to get started into. 

Rattan fighting is the macho thing to do, and men buy into the whole machismo
thing much more readily than women do. Knicknames like "swishypoke" don't do a
lot to enhance the "manly" reputation of fencing either.  Come on guys, how
many of you would rather be a "swishypoke" than a "rhinohide"? But the apparent
sexual innuendo of "swishypoke" doesn't apply to women, women aren't bothered
at all by being thought unmanly, or effimate. Archery also suffers from the
idea that to stand at a distance to shoot your enemy is  cowardly.  The
manly thing to do is to stand face to face with your opponent and give him the
chance to kill you while you're trying to kill him.  To shoot and run away is
dishonorable, ergo, archers must be dishonorable. Women aren't supposed to
stand and fight, so its okay for women to be archers.  Although a lot of
fighters think it's not okay to be an archer, period, because they're not
allowed to hit archers, and after you've just come under withering archery
fire, boy do you want to hit those archers!

Women fighters are only going to become more prevalent as the society at large
alters its standards to produce more aggressive, physically fit women, and as
attitudes change to be more supportive of such women.  This is why there is a
gap in abilty of women fighters: some women are already benefitting by the
changes of society, and are much better equipped by their childhood to
undertake the mental and physical discipline of rattan combat.  Most women are
not so equipped, and are at a definite disadvantage  in rattan combat. 

 The surest way to fame and success in the SCA is rattan combat.  This is how
you get to be king.  This is how you get to be a knight.Winning tourneys is how
you get to sit at head table with the brass hats.  Being a good fighter is how
you get to be a brass hat.  Yes, other skills and service are rewarded in the
SCA, but none so heavily as rattan combat, nor so publicly. Knighting
ceremonies are done with full pomp in court.  Efforts are being made to provide
the other accolades with equally impressive ceremonies, but how many of people
make a point at watching a pelican get invested, as compared to want to watcha
knight get made?Everyone agrees that combat is not the be all and end all of
the SCA, but it sure looks that way.  And that means men are going to dominate
the thrones for a long time to come.

(See Kwellend leave for tourney.  See Kwellend forget feast-gear.
 See Kwellend realize that having to go home to eat means getting

Victory in the finals of todays East Kingdom Crown Tourney went to
Sir Rhys ap Harlech, who defeated Earl Sir Shannon an Chausur in
the third of a best two out of three final round.  For the life 
of me I can't remember who Rhys defeated to make the finals, Sir
Shannon defeated Sir Wulfstan Thorhallsson in his semi-final match.
I'm also sorry to say that I didn't catch Rhys's lady's name, but
my lady is pretty sure that it is Ilena (Elaina?  Something that
sounds like that.)

Their majesties addressed the fighters and consorts at noon, with
combat beginning around 12:30, and finishing around 4pm.  There were
some 42 or 43 gentles in the list, of whom at least two were women.

A more detailed posting later, when I'm less exhausted.

I don't understand how this is true. How can a household being competent in
some art or science make it difficult for me to pursue that art or science?
Granted, the fact that a group is good in some area may mean I have to get up
to their level to be thought competent, but how does that prevent me from
pursuing the subject?

If by "pursue", you mean "get an award for", that certainly can be true. 
Surely all these awards are around because people like giving and getting
them, but I often wonder if we would be better off (though probably smaller)
by not having awards (from the peerages and royal ranks on down). After all,
how much fun do you think we might have dancing, fighting, making and drinking
the mead, cooking and eating the feasts, and sewing and wearing clothes for
ourselves?

  There was a description recently when a gentle was dis-envested of a garment
     whose cloth was of dubious provenance.  It sounded quite funny and 
     entertaining.  I couldn't help hoping, though, that the gentle involved
     was "in on" the gag, _and had agreed to it beforehand._  I'd be very 
     distressed to find otherwise.

While incidents of this sort, however alarming, are as scarce as

Greetings Rialto,
To those who say that the term "stickjock" refers to theose whose
interest lies only in fighting, i say Buzz.  Wrong answer, at least in
some groupls/places.  To me, and the people I deal with, it seems to
mean someone that plays with sticks, wether or not they do other stuff
or not.  Like a lot of slang, it terms, its meaning varies.  Rhinohide
is the same.  My SO is a rhinohide, as you can smack him QUITE hard, and
he hardly reacts, having a very high pain threshold, but he still takes
his blows like a good boy :]  I guess the point I'm trying to make is
that such terms may denote generic fighter-types, as usually (IMHO seems
to be the case, and not derogatory.

     Does anyone know who owns the copyright for the song "The

I've not seen the friend in about fifteen years and have no idea

made a trip to New York and searched the copyright listings on
file
at the library in Lincoln Center, to no avail. I've recorded
an
original arrangement of the song, which I plan to release, and I
need to know who owns the copyright for licensing, royalty
payments
and avoiding copyright infringement.

     The first verse goes:

     "From Macclesfield to Moberley, if you have wares to sell
      Don't leave the path at the Wizard Inn or drink at the
       Wizard's Well."

     Anyone recognize this? Does anybody own the album with this
song on it? Does anybody know anything about it? Release date is
creeping up on me... Any information would be appreciated.

     For financial reasons, I don't get the Digest anymore, so
replies posted to the Rialto will disappear, unheeded, into
space.
Any information should be sent to me by E-Mail at 70531,1217
on Compuserve, or by mail to:

          Spiralsongs
          23 Beacon Street
          Mattapoisett, MA  02739

     Anyone helping me find the information I need will get a
"special thanks" on the album liner!

Steffan ap Cennydd to the Rialto, greetings!

PERSONAS IN FICTION: There is also "The Man Who Made Ale" by J.R. Schifino
(Baron Ferall von Halstern, MSCA, EK Warlord), published in a literary
magazine "Just Pulp" some years ago. Most of Bridge and a hefty chunk of
Carolingia and Ostgardr appear in it. My lady was a major character; I had a
cameo. Hilarious stuff if you can find it (and understand the inside jokes).
See Master El if he makes it to the War.

IMP. COMP. for HORIC: 
        There was Horic, We thought he was sick,
        As a War-Puppy he was insane,
        Gave up Tranya for Imperium Compound,
        Now we have an Acid Reign (Oh wow, man!)
No, I will *not* explain it....

HERALDIC REGALIA: The investiture ceremony for the Triton Principal Herald
(used by Mistress Moira Maureen ua' Seamus at the investiture of Minowara
Kiritsubo-no-kami (now -sensei) ended with the lines "put on the Armour of the
Law [the tabard] and take the sign of your noble office [the staff] that all
may know you". I don't know the provenance of the ceremony, but knowing both
Moira and Kiri, I suspect it has authentic origins to some extent.
        I've always felt that "those silly green aprons" oughta be trashed.
There is only one correct tabard design for a herald: the arms of the person
he is serving. If you want to get Tudor about it, you can show rank by
richness of material. Thus Laurel wears a surcote (*not* a tabard) of SCA in
velvet. Principal Heralds wear a tabard of Kingdom front, back & sleeves, as
do regionals and Heralds Extraordinary, the PE possibly in velvet, regionals
and HE's in satin. Pursuivants wear their group arms (in linen, perhaps)
*athwart*, and Purs-@-large's wear Kingdom, but athwart. What use for the
green trumpets, you ask: put 'em on a baldric when your doing "duty heralding"
at a big event and just want to say "Hi, need a herald? I'm one." Same as a
marshall would wear *his* baldric: it's just a badge that says you hold this
office in the club. It's not authentic period garb at all. When you're doing
Royal Court, it's obvious who the herald is: you don't need the office badge
but you *do* need the authentic costume: that's the tabard of arms.

IMPERIUM COMPOUND: Lydia Pinkham's Vegetable Remedy was an herbal elixir for
"female troubles", i.e. menstrual ireegularities. It may be still available; I
have sold it as recently as ten years ago. I'll try to get the formula and
post it. [Posted by alternate persona of Steven H. Mesnick, RPh, FASCP].
HARTSHORN: "*Spirits* of Harthorn is an old synonym for smelling salts (that
ammonia would wake the dead....).

PERSONAS: Anyone who thinks personas are inevitably either silly and
convoluted or vague and poorly-researched should seek out two acknowledged
masters of the Art: Duke Cariadoc, and Meister Johannes von Nuerenstein (now
in Indianapolis). 'Hannes still sends me letters with the latest news from
Nuremberg in this exciting year of 1405, and can talk about modern happenings
without ever breaking persona. I have less experience (alas!) talking to
Cariadoc but he is the recognized champion at this (difficult) form of
performing art (yeah, that's what it is....).

I think that this is stated too strongly.  The attitudes you imply occur, but
are usually the result of ignorance, not malice.  They are also neither
universal nor (in my opinion) all that common.  Nicknames do not always
correspond to low regard--I myself often call rapier combat "wire-wiggling" or
"swishypoking", but I participate in it regularly, enjoy it immensely, and
I respect my opponents, whether they are male or female, whether they also
fight with rattan or not.  I also am an avid archer, both combat and target.
I have on occasion run into examples of the attitudes you mention, although
not very frequently, and they generally seem to occur in people who tend to
be discourteous in rattan fighting as well.  The sort of person who behaves
ill towards an archer who has just shot him (or her) often is the sort of
person who behaves ill towards an opponent who has just slain him (or her)
in single combat.  Jerks occur everywhere, but happily they are not very
common (or hopefully they are not very common).

  Here in the northern parts of the Outlands, there are only about 5 lady
fighters active, and a couple more who dabble at it.  Three are good to quite
good, two are promising beginners.  No lady knights at all are from our 
kingdom (yet!.)  I can think of one who should be soon though.

  There is no reason that a woman cannot be a good fighter as any man.  One 
cannot site size as a problem,  Our last king, Leif, is a good head-and-a-half
shorter than I am, and he won over several giants on the field (I'm 6' tall.)
Strength is not a problem, my squire, Llamrei is pound-for-pound, I think,
stronger than I, and the shots that I teach come from the hips, which as she
says, gives her lower center of gravity an advantage.  Pain tolerance?  Give
me a break!  Women bear children, what male can evince THAT kind of pain 
tolerance!?  Lets face it, the ladies are every bit as good as the men, but for
many men (and women) they need to be better than the guys to be equal.  The 
problem is just plain socialized predudice, on both sides.  Many guys just 
can't stand the thought of being beaten "by a girl", so, many times the lasses
are patronized, and their blows are ignored!  I know that I am going to be
flamed by this last comment, but I don't know how many times I've seen someone
(usually a large older fighter) shrug off a shot that could not possibly have
been good enough, because it came from a little girl.  And, it really bugs me
when the ladies aren't taken seriously, because this is a macho sport, "and not
for girls!"  
  
  I'm sorry for the length of this posting, but this subject hits one of my hot
buttons and I will shoot flame for an hour on it!

Subject: Safety in SCA Camps: safety in numbers

	I recently read digest #684.  I was surprised to see
  Orilee's  thoughts on "Personal Safety in SCA Camps".  I am
 (or at least I am told I am) one of   these "nubile young women" 
I have been wandering around Pennsic for many years, as has my
 10-yr-old sister. I think the important thing is *how* these 
people   are wandering around Pennsic.
	My sister and I have good friends, adult, teenaged, and
 child, who wander around Pennsic with us, at various intervals.
  None of us has had any trouble.  Anywhere we go, there is
always a group and/or someone in our or our friend's "family".  If
 children/teens/newcomers are instructed properly in protocol, 
they should have no problems at all.  Anyway, my experience has
 been that there is safety in numbers and also, there is not a 
real problem.  Most people can take no for an answer,
and those who can't, will, in a large group.
	I hope my point is not taken wrong.  Part of the 
responsibility *is* on "the girl".  For example, walking around
 in bunny fur bikinis when you don't want attention is *not* 
a good idea, and is likely to be taken wrong.

Subject: majesty

Oh,rats, someobody beat me to the history of the usage fo the word "majesty".
but I can add a few more details.  The term majesty rapidly came intouse for
kings and queens after the Pope grante dthe title to Ferdinand and Isabella of
Spain after they conquered the Moors and Christianized the entirety of nation.
Expelling and converting Jews and Moors was very highly thought of, and F and I
were some of the most admired monarchs of their age.  They were also some of
the most frightening monarchs.  See Machiavelli's the Prince for descriptions of their
politcal tactics.   

But to return to the subject, our monarchs ought to be referred to as highness
or grace, or by any other title the monarch holds, such as Sir, Count, Lord,
Baron, etc. 

As to the problem of what your persona should call the king and queen, mine
uses "majesty" because that's what everybody else does, and being a practical
sort of persona, Awilda is willing to go along with whatever those silly
Continentals want to do.  Icelanders are all more or less equal, so titles
aren't terribly important to her.  (yes, I know there were slaves, but they
represented a real minority compared to Contintal serfs, and they had more
rights)

As I recall, somewhat hazily, Henry the VIII got the title majesty along with
Defender of the Faith when he and the Pope were on good terms. And after he
separated from the Church, he kept them.  

I wonder, what are existing monarchs in Europe called?  The English and Spanish
are hanging onto the 'majesty" business, but what are the monarchs of Sweden,
Holland, Monte Carlo, Denmark, and so forth called.  And as I rack my brain,
are their any other nations in Europe with extant offical royalty,  as versus
unoffical royalty, such as France has?

Subject: Personas

yes there are people who don't ahve personas, not even names.  Sir Randall
Winnie of House Pooh immediately springs to mind.  Sir Randall is mundanely
Randall Winnie.  But the canting on the name was inescapable, and so he could
never have made a persona name if he tried.

And some people are to thoroughly identified for people to use a SCA name, no
matter how hard they try.  Long ago a popular dancemaster in North Woods was
known as Lord Chris, no matter how hard he tried to convince people to call him
Vidrir, it just didn't work.  I myself ran into the same problem.  In
Ealdermere I am known as Gwen, and people have to think very hard to remember
I'm Awilda.  In my local group I'm called Awilda even in mundane situations.

Then there are the people who become their persona.  Tristan Alexander has
completely abandoned his mundane name and uses his SCA name professionally.
he's an artist, and all his works are signed Tristan.  His SCA persona does not
differ significantly from his mundane persona, the mundane has been abandoned.

SCA personas can become firmly fixed in people's minds as being the "real"
persona.  I remember hearing the then Prince Hugo lament, "I wish people
wouldn't call me "Highness" when I'm wearing blue jeans and loading my car.  I
dont' feel very royal."

Keeping track of is who is who can be a very slippery and tricky business.  
I have known some people to play caricturess of themselves so that they won't be
taken seriously and get into trouble.  These were people who were so good at
playing their personas that people believed in them and were most disturbed to
discover it was all an act. This can be especially troubling to people who seek
love and friendship in the SCA.It's why Awilda and Gwen are basically the same
personality. The older I get the harder it is to have a split personality.  I'd
rather jsut be me and not worry about it all.

Subject: Site Security

They question of security within a SCA camp has been addresesd by several
people, but no one is talking about very real incidents that have happened, and
need to be prepared for in case they happen again.  

I will briefly relate two incidents that I personally witnessed, and I will say
that I have heard of others that may or may not be true reports.  

In the first incident, late one night three drunk and/or high youths visted the
campground, were met by a sentry, and asked waht was going on.  He explained,
and they rudely delivered their opinion on the whole affair.  He asked them to
leave, and they went and skulked in the dark.  he hollered for help, and got
it.  His swordbrothers (and sisters) formed a defensive perimeter.  The
autocrat was notified, and he asked an off duty police officer attendinghte
event to assist.  The officer went out and told the three youths to go away and
go home, and politely explained the penalties for trespassing, making a
nuisance, public intoxication, etc.  They went away.  Meanwhile, a dozen
emotional SCA folk were skulking in the dark to back him up.  I was one of them
because I was rather alarmed at the temper of the SCA folk, and figured a level
head would be a good and useful thing.  Crouching in a ditch next a man who was
fingering a knife and begging for an opportunity to show them the error of
their ways was a unique and memorable experience.

The second incident involved drunk mundanes, a shot gun, and a set of
firecrackers.  The mundanes who lived jsut across the narrow road from the
campground, perpetrated verious mild harrassments through the day, not the
least of which was shotgun target practice while drinking.  I was camped next t
to security's radio base so I got to hear one half the radio traffic on this
incident.  Late at night, one of the mundanes entered the camp and lit off a
string of firecrackers in a densely tented area.  About the same time the
shotgun was fired very close at hand.  I don't know where, when, or why it was
fired.  After setting the firecrackers, the mundane fled.  One version of the
story says he had a shotgun with him.  The firecrackers went off in front of
the tent of a Brass Hat who grabbed his fire extinguisher and put out a small
fire while shouting for help.  Security and the household guards responded. Teh
police were called.  They went over and explained that it was not appropriate
to throw firecrackers at sleeping people or to practice the shotgun in the
middle of the might.  No further incident ocurred, but the Brass Hat pointed
out that if he hadn't had a fire extinguisher, several tents might have burned.
I'm an officer of the group that hosted the event, but as far as I can tell no
steps are being taken to improve security or fire safety.  

As unpleasant as it may be, we must recognize the fact the ignorant,
irresponsible people can out of simple thoughtlessness and mild malice endanger
the lives of SCA folk, and we need to do something to protect ourselves.  I
think this means developing a security branch, just as we have a marshallate
and chirurgeonate.  Regular patrols, a central office, and guards on the gate
at all hours can help identify and contain any potential incidents.  These
constables would be trained, just as marshalls and chirurgeons have to be
trained, and warranted.  Various duties could be assigned to them, everythign
from taking drunks home to bed (or to the chirurgeons) to interfacing with
police, to preventing entry of unlawful persons, to fire safety could be
assigned to them.  I know SCa is built on the idea of individual responsibilty,
and that is good, but it isn't adequate to deal with some of the more serious
problems we are facing with increasing frequency.  I would rather have a
trained and warranted security force to deal with interlopers than what I have
seen of a bunch of emotional nitwits running out into the dark to be heroes. 

I would greatly appreciate being informed of any other *substantiated*
incidents and what happened, and whether the groups involved have taken steps
to cope with such problems, and what those steps might be.

Subject: Gauge for helms

Greetings.

Some gentles have remarked that 16 gauge seems a bit thin for
helms (referring to my earlier posting about testing the effect
of wraparound blows).

I may have given a wrong figure here... the reason is that here
in Europe, "gauge" is yet another of those unintelligible American
measurements that we don't use. Steel plate is measured in millimeters.
We use 1.5 mm steel for helms. What this corresponds to in gauge, I
don't really know. We never cease to wonder how anyone could invent
a system where 16 units is *thinner* than 14 units. Oh, well...

Subject: Households; female combatants (long)

Greetings!

In dig. #688, Justin du Coeur wrote in rebuttal to some of my comments 
regarding households.  Fine; no problem.  However, I do think he either missed 
my point, or possibly mis-interpreted me in a couple of places.  So, now it's 
my turn!  :-)  (No flames intended, Justin!)

All stereotypes have some unfortunate basis in fact.  That "household" is
often equated with "clique" is a comment in and of itself.  While not the case 
in many places (including, with one exception, here in my own Barony), such 
*is* indeed the case in enough places that the association with "clique" or 
"faction" has arisen.  I think that's bad.  I also think it arises, when such 
is the case, in part from a group's identity, or lack of it.  If a group has a 
strong identity as such _per se_, households are far less likely to be a 
problem.  And while households are indeed useful, and can indeed be necessary, 
I do not think they should be necessary _for the welcoming of newcomers_.  
Rather, the group as a whole should take that responsibility (see below).

See above.  From the Carolingians I've interacted with, it would appear that 
this Barony has the kind of strong sense of group identity I was referring to. 
Such is true of my own Barony as well.  Neither group (again, with one 
exception in my case) has had problems with households.

WHOA!!  I *never* made any kind of remarks about people being able to belong 
to only one household!  The fact of the matter is that I've battled that very 
concept myself, and that I myself belong to about 5 different households.  And 
when I have run into this attitude, it is *within* a given household!  In 
other words, I have found this attitude to be invariably associated with 
households headed by individuals who personally subscribe to and endorse it, 
and enforce it within theirs.  What's more, it has been my experience that
these are the kinds of households one can most often equate with "clique" or 
"faction."

I completely agree that no one office/person can handle the kinds of new 
member influxes groups are seeing today.  Indeed, in some ways this supports 
my point that groups as a body need to deal with the situation.

Now, my Barony gets, proportionately, about the same rate of influx Justin
cites for Carolingia.  And whether there is one new face in the crowd or 100
(literally), the seneschal points out the presence of a newcomer(s), and
admonishes *everyone* to go greet the newcomer(s) and talk to them.  Newcomers 
are asked to stand and introduce themselves, and each one gets a multi-voiced 
"Hi!" upon doing so.  The seneschal also takes a quick moment to explain 
what's going on, and invites the newcomer(s) to ask questions after the 
meeting.  At the close of meetings, newcomers are often surrounded by people 
saying "Welcome" and inviting them to join us for dinner.

This is what I'm talking about.  The Barony of An Crosaire, in its entirety, 
takes responsibility for newcomers.  Not just Gold Key; not any specific 
household.  All of us.  Yes, we have Gold Key to help out with the details; 
yes, there are numerous "sub-groups" such as households in An Crosaire, and 
many newcomers end up associating with one or more.  But first, they are given 
the chance to become comfortable amongst us, and to find their own direction.

>I have seen a *lot* of new people come into the Society, having been in

As far as reasons people leave the Society go, my experience has been the 
opposite of Justin's.  And, again, it takes everyone working together to 
welcome new people to keep them from falling through the cracks-- but then, 
that's the way I think it should be.

Again:  it is my opinion that if the only way that newcomers are properly
welcomed in a given place is through quick adoption by a household, then that
is an indication the the group as a whole is falling down on the job.  And 
that moreover such a situation both illustrates and defines the much-discussed 
problem of failure on the part of many groups to properly welcome and assist 
newcomers to the Society.

>One more point: Cher implies that joining a household early on will limit
>one's activites and interests. I question this *very* strongly -- any
>household that limits its members to specific interests has something
>very wrong with it, and this is not at all common, in my experience...

No, no, NO!!  I neither said that nor meant that!  What I *did* say was that a 
person could join a household, only to _later discover_, as they find their 
own interests and directions, that they have nothing in common with the rest 
of their household.  Or, they could find themselves greatly disliking the 
members of the household.  But that joining a household would somehow impose
limitations upon one was *not* indicated.

Let me use myself as an example:  90% of the people I became close friends 
with upon joining the Society (and who still constitute most of my "immediate 
family") belong to House Ironflower.  House Ironflower is Tetsuo and Kimineko 
Sakura's (Founding Baron and Baroness An Crosaire) household, and it is 
comprised almost entirely of people whose major area of interest is things 
Japanese.  Had I entered House Ironflower early on in my time in the Society, 
I would soon have found myself surrounded by people utterly fascinated by 
things in which I have only a passing interest.  Such being the case, I would 
have been better off getting to know them and my own interests better before 
joining the Household.  (NOTE:  after knowing the Sakuras for many years-- 
like, 12 years-- I was eventually given the singular honor-- or so I consider
it-- of inclusion in House Ironflower, becoming only the second
non-Japanese-type household member.) 

I have seen this happen many times.  I have had gentles seek me out for advice 
on how best to leave a household which they no longer care to be a part of.  
Usually, there is absolutely no rancor involved; if there were, the gentle 
probably wouldn't be worrying about how to leave without hurting feelings and 
damaging relationships.  Whether for lack of common interests,
incompatability, or whatever, these individuals regret having joined a
household preciptously and now don't know how to politely extricate 
themselves.  And all that was needed to have avoided the whole situation to 
begin with was a little time, and possibly some better effort on the part of 
the individual's home group to welcome them as well.

All in all, I think it behooves each and every one of us to remember that 
newcomers are the responsibility of each and every one of us who has gone 
before, and that we were *all* newcomers once.


And, now for something completely different:  I *knew* I was forgetting a 
topic in my last posting!  :-)

Regarding the subject of female knights:  one of the postings discussing the 
history of female knights in the SCA (unfortunately, I forget which one-- my 
apologies!) dismissed the aspect of legal violations as having been part of
the BoD's decision to permit female combatants, stating that the said decision 
was based solely on the documentary evidence presented to the Board.

Well, it is absolutely true that solid documentary evidence was presented to 
the Board.  It is *not* true that the mundane legalities of the situation had 
nothing to do with the Board's decision.  The legal facts are that barring 
females from participating in the martial acts activities of the Society (a 
non-profit, tax-exempt organization, which is relevant to their legal status) 
would have been a violation of mundane civil rights laws.  Had their been 
solid documentation that females never touched a weapon under any 
circumstances, it wouldn't have mattered diddly.  Mundane law takes
precedence, and the Board would have been faced with a choice of permitting
female combatants (or being forced to do so by a mundane court) or flushing
the SCA's non-profit status.  That this was the legal situation was
acknowledged by the Board of that time.  Happily, history and current mundane
realities did not conflict, and the issue was easily resolved.  Nonetheless, 
it's something I think we should all be aware of.  Some mundane laws intrude 
where we least expect it, such as in the case of oaths of fealty.  And, 
ignorance ain't necessarily bliss!

Eoin states that 'King Kobold' is the first pf Christopher Stashef's books,
rather than 'The Warlock In Spite of Himself'.  I believe this to be untrue.
I have all three works, (Warlock In Spite.., King Kobold, and King Kobold
Revisited) and the copyright date for Warlock is 1969, whereas the copyright
date for King Kobold is 1971.  King Kobold revisited is 1984.

I would have to definitely agree that 'The Warlock in Spite of Himself' is
the best of these works, although 'Escape Velocity', wherein the ancestor of
the hero of the Warlock books actually meets the SCA, is damn good.

Subject: More safety tips....

Greetings to the Rialto!

There are three things to fear at large gatherings such as Pennsic or
Estrella,

You, Others, and Fire.

You are the greatest potential danger to yourself through lack of knowledge
and experience.  Seek a mentor or good friend to give you intial guidance at
the begining.  Then when you are a veteran, perform the same for others.

Others are a danger when they remain hidden in the mask of strangers.  It is
easier to harm a stranger than a friend.  Make it a point to reduce the total
number of strangers in the world.

Fire can kill you.  You wouldn't want to kill yourself, would you?  Your
friends don't want to kill you.  Only a careless stranger will kill you.  (See
item about strangers, above).

Yours for a safer, friendlier War,

Dur the Nasty, Baron of Grey Matter.

Why do you want to do this?  I would think that any incoming line
could be used for a true emergency, or one could call the local
sherrif/police/fire department and explain the situation.  I don't ven
like watches at an event - the thought of being available by phone is
pretty dismal.  ("Excuse me, your majesty - your secretary on line three"

Greetings, all, from Ariel.

First off, thanks again to everyone (especially Laura McVay) for sitting with me
while I learned the intricacies of netnews.  Now I can figure out how to do
some of the neat things the rest of you can do with your mail systems!

Nagaseru Otaka Kobara (konnichi-wa!) asked about whether there were males in 
the Bitches' Guild.  Oh yes -- the principal member is the lord of our big
household... but the ladies are the ones whose eyes light up when they hear
we have such a Guild!  (Bethany:  If you want to consider the Guild a household 
you'd definitely be a member in good standing!  Net connections are permitted.)

On households: People like to group, and new people like to have other people
to hang around with while playing in the SCA.  Small wonder households have
appeal.  Depending on where you are and what you're like, this can be a good
thing and a bad thing.  I certainly would never discourage people from becoming
part of a household if that's what they'd like to do (at last count I belonged
to three and had lots to do with a whole bunch of 'em) -- but it's hard to
caution people to take their time when the first thing so many of them want to
do is BELONG.  I'm the first to admit I could have been a shade more cautious
when I was first starting out, though I did receive an interesting education
in the process...

Conversely, what does one do when a household has so many people it becomes
top-heavy?  Not such a good idea to recruit then...

Brianna Arielle Durand (nice middle name!) asked about Pennsic.  We've just
found out that there will be no shuttle service from Pittsburgh Airport this
year, and that it won't work simply to show up there and call Cooper's Lake
on the pay phone.  As soon as you're able, you should arrange to get someone to
come out and pick you up.  It's usually easier for the go-getters when they 
can plan what day/time to be at the airport, especially if there are several 
people coming in from the same group.

Feel free to email me if you have any other Pennsic questions, milady, though
I daresay the BMDL folks (and Gavin, if he's out there) could tell you more
things more accurately...

      Yes, knighthood was expensive.  For example, the Assize of Arms
of Henry II of England declared: "Let every holder of a knight's fee
have a hauberk, a helmet, a shield and a lance."  Add the three horse
required of a knight and the upkeep of any valets or armigers, and
you come to a pretty penny for even a fairly undistinguished knight.
      Knighthood was so expensive that many, although possessing the
ways and means, refused dubbing to avoid participating in the honor and
expenses of knighthood.  Philippe Contamine, in _War in the Middle
Ages_, writes that in late 13th Century England, there were some 1,250
knights (earls and barons included), of whom only ~500 were capable of
mobilization.  At the same time, there were up to 1,750 non-knights who
had sufficient revenues and fees to become knights if they had so
desired.  The Crown, through distraints of knighthood, made 26 attempts
between 1224 and 1272 to enlist all men possessing the knightly fee of
L20 (20 pounds).
      Although I could find no figures for total knightly income, per
se, I did find figures for scutage (fees paid in lieu of military
service), wages paid militia, fief rents (fief de chambre) and fees which, although
amounting to payment for volunteers, was apparently not considered
such, but more of a campaign indemnity paid to allow the warriors to
meet the supplementary expenses of war.
      In the first category, at the end of the 12th Century, the 50
knights of Bury St Edmunds paid the abbot 29d every 20 weeks rather
than mount watch. The rate of scutage in England in the second half of
the 12th Century was levied at the rate of 6d (6 pence) per day, that is
240d or L1 per the standard 40 day period of service.  Contamine also
says that, "In 1227 Frederick II, preparing his crusade, ordered that
in the kingdom of Sicily 'every fief-holder should pay for each fief
eight ounces of gold and every eight fiefs should provide a knight'; in
other words, from each group of eight fees the King-Emperor would get
one knight and 64 ounces of gold which represented about a year's pay
at current rates"(91.)   
      One of the uses of the money thus collected was the payment of
militia.  In Perugia and Florence in the 13th Century, the militiamen
were paid from the first day of the campaign.  This pay amounted to 5s
per foot soldier, 10s for a man with one horse, 15s for a man with two
horses (Perugia), 3s for crossbowmen, 2s 8d for archers, 2s 6d for
pavesiers and 2s for ordinary foot soldiers in Florence.(91)
      Fief rents were, in effect, annual pensions paid for eventual
service.  Contamine gives the case of Fernand de Jean as an example. 
This worthy, a Castilian knight who had abandoned the service
of the king of Castile, had been in receipt of an annual income of 300l
(300 livres) from that source.  For his first year in service to Philip
III of France, he received the same sum during pleasure of for life in
exchange for homage to Phillip III above all others (except Philip's
nephews, sons of his sister Blanche, and  Fernando of Castile).  He was
required to serve Philipe with 10 knights freely for 40 days a year,
presenting himself and men within 6 weeks of summons.  He was only
required to serve only the lands of the king of Aragon, Castile, and
Portugal, in the kingdom of Navarre, in Gascony and in the county of
Toulouse.  After the 40 days he would draw a daily wage of 7s 6d
(tournois), with no provisions for replacing of lost horses.(92-93) 
       Finally, Contamine gives the daily rates for soldiers in
England and France c. 1150-c.1300 as

             Knights       foot soldiers
1150-70      6d

      Yes, knighthood was expensive.  For example, the Assize of Arms
of Henry II of England declared: "Let every holder of a knight's fee
have a hauberk, a helmet, a shield and a lance."  Add the three horse
required of a knight and the upkeep of any valets or armigers, and
you come to a pretty penny for even a fairly undistinguished knight.
      Knighthood was so expensive that many, although possessing the
ways and means, refused dubbing to avoid participating in the honor and
expenses of knighthood.  Philippe Contamine, in _War in the Middle
Ages_, writes that in late 13th Century England, there were some 1,250
knights (earls and barons included), of whom only ~500 were capable of
mobilization.  At the same time, there were up to 1,750 non-knights who
had sufficient revenues and fees to become knights if they had so
desired.  The Crown, through distraints of knighthood, made 26 attempts
between 1224 and 1272 to enlist all men possessing the knightly fee of
L20 (20 pounds).
      Although I could find no figures for total knightly income, per
se, I did find figures for scutage (fees paid in lieu of military
service), wages paid militia, fief rents (fief de chambre) and fees which, although
amounting to payment for volunteers, was apparently not considered
such, but more of a campaign indemnity paid to allow the warriors to
meet the supplementary expenses of war.
      In the first category, at the end of the 12th Century, the 50
knights of Bury St Edmunds paid the abbot 29d every 20 weeks rather
than mount watch. The rate of scutage in England in the second half of
the 12th Century was levied at the rate of 6d (6 pence) per day, that is
240d or L1 per the standard 40 day period of service.  Contamine also
says that, "In 1227 Frederick II, preparing his crusade, ordered that
in the kingdom of Sicily 'every fief-holder should pay for each fief
eight ounces of gold and every eight fiefs should provide a knight'; in
other words, from each group of eight fees the Kin-Emperor would get
one knight and 64 ounces of gold which represented about a year's pay
at current rates"(91.)   
      One of the uses of the money thus collected was the payment of
militia.  In Perugia and Florence in the 13th Century, the militiamen
were paid from the first day of the campaign.  This pay amounted to 5s
per foot soldier, 10s for a man with one horse, 15s for a man with two
horses (Perugia), 3s for crossbowmen, 2s 8d for archers, 2s 6d for
pavesiers and 2s for ordinary foot soldiers in Florence.(91)
      Fief rents were, in effect, annual pensions paid for eventual
service.  Contamine gives the case of Fernand de Jean as an example. 
This worthy, a Castilian knight who had abandoned the service
of the king of Castile, had been in receipt of an annual income of 300l
(300 livres) from that source.  For his first year in service to Philip
III of France, he received the same sum during pleasure of for life in
exchange for homage to Phillip III above all others (except Philip's
nephews, sons of his sister Blanche, and  Fernando of Castile).  He was
required to serve Philipe with 10 knights freely for 40 days a year,
presenting himself and men within 6 weeks of summons.  He was only
required to serve only the lands of the king of Aragon, Castile, and
Portugal, in the kingdom of Navarre, in Gascony and in the county of
Toulouse.  After the 40 days he would draw a daily wage of 7s 6d
(tournois), with no provisions for replacing of lost horses.(92-93) 
       Finally, Contamine gives the daily rates for soldiers in
England and France c. 1150-c.1300 as

            Knights               foot soldiers1150-70      6d

Greetings unto the Rialto

No offence intended to Ioseph of Locksley, but I cannot agree with the
pronouncation of Chiurgeon.

Officially, we do not pronounce chiurgeon as surgeon, (at least, here in
the West) instead we pronounce it "ki (with long i) -urgeon", this is in
attempt to advoid certain misunderstandings.  We by no means want to be
protrayed as medieval doctors, or even as mundane ones, our primary
cause is to provide first-aid to those who need it; anything beyond that is 
to be discouraged, granted there could circumstances which may require more, but
then that is dependant on the chiurgeon's mundane training and a responsible
chiurgeon take steps to remove the Society's liability and explain his/hers
actions to the patient, and say that he/she is responsible for said actions.  
The Good Samaritan Laws cover only so much, they are generally dependant on the 
person's documentable training and any successful malpractice suit against
the SCA would be extremely damaging, hopefully no chiurgeon will bring one
down upon us.

Your Servant,

Wolfgang Rotkopf

Greetings to the Rialto

With respect to the discussion about attacks at Pennsic, I clearly recall the
two "alledged" assaults on ladies at Pennsic 5 years ago, and rumors of
incidents since then.

Note that I am not raising these issues to be contrary to those who say that
"Pennsic is the safest place", but to provide some direct counterpoint to the
discussion.

I remember these events (painfully) well, for I rashly responded to the rumors
with great concern for the safety of my wife.  I regret the stupid actions I
nearly took out of fear and anger.

To all and sundry who may come to read this Colin Mackay here sends greetings!
First on Lady Knights, here in An Tir we have 2 neither at the moment resident,
Bolverk was knighted in An Tir and is currently teaching in Africa, The second
ladies name is Crissiant and I believe is studying at Oxford.
On wrap around blows, I find them to be effective and I have heard of some one
from An Tir looking at some helms in a museum somewhere and the damage that he
saw apparantely could only have been done with a wrap around, this is
conjecture but the person I belive was an armourer so should know of what he
speaks.  Hope this is of help to the debate/question.

Greetings:

I remember a few Pensics back walking back with a friend to our encampment when
we were stopped by some security folk asking us if we had seen or been accosted
by a very drunk person.  It seems that this drunk had been wondering around the
harassing folk (mostly women).  They did find this gentle eventually.  (I don't
know what they did to him.)  At a war prior to that, some friends of mine had
live steel pulled on them by some drunks.  A security type was there and managed
to diffuse the situation.

Overall, I believe that the security folk at Pensic are doing a good job and  
should be congratulated for it.  VIVAT!!!

Please, please, please, people, don't get the wrong idea.  There are two very good
reasons for not wandering Pennsic by one'self.  And the possibility of assault (of which
rape is one variation) is the lesser of the two.  The main reason is that it's quite easy
for one to injure oneself when wandering the camp.  One can trip over a line or stake,
hit one's head, or any other bit of accidental damage can occur.

Secondarily, while a class of this sort is definitely helpful in that it may allow one
to continue thinking in a crisis, it will probably not enable a 98 pound lady in full skirts
to defeat a 200+ pound heavy list fighter in unarmed combat.  It takes more than a couple
of hours to learn to do this with reliability.

It definitely will help one withstand the verbal and psychological attacks though, and
hopefully be able to give as well as received.

Yup, you're right.

Lady Sir Bolverk of Momchilovich (I believe was knighted in An Tir.)
and nobody has yet mentioned Lady Sir Chrissiant. (also of An Tir and
knighted about 3 years ago.)

Those of you who know Bolverk might be interested to know that she's
currently living in ...Botswana(?) teaching elementary school. She had
originally planned to go out for a year and is currently half-way through
her second! Two months ago, Master Gerhard von Nordflammen went out to join
her.

Subject: Elizabethan wedding ceremonies

Greetings unto the good gentles of the Rialto from Ciara ni Mhaille
of the Barony of Nordskogen, Middle Kingdom.

Sioned O'Foirbhithe, in digest #690, asks for information on Elizabethan
wedding ceremonies.  Don't panic my lady!  The solution is simpler than
you might think.  The best source for a copy of this ceremony is the
16th century edition of the anglican Book of Common Prayer.

My lord and I were married three years ago using our own modification of
this ceremony (the original version is extremely long - we estimated it would
take at least 2 hours.  Some of the prayers are pages long).

As to where to find a copy of the 16th century prayer book, I found it in
the library of a local catholic university.  This is probably a good place
to start, since it is an important document in the study of church history.
Or you might call your local Episcopal Archdiocese for information on how
to find a copy in your area.

I'd be happy to snail mail you a copy of our revised ceremony if you're
interested, although some of what we added was quite modern.

Slan agaibh! (Health to you, good gentles)

While I agree with you that generally  SCA camps are amongst the safest

shrugged off with "this sort of thing is going to happen".  Rape is an

	Discuession has been raised saying that perhaps wraps were used, 
citing as evidence damage to the back of helms and that there was 
protection there in the first place.  May I suggest perhaps this is
due not to a wrap from the guy you are facing but rather to a normal

Subject: Re: HRM Phone Home

At Pennsic, there are at least 3 pay phones that get a great deal of use.
If you just want to call someone, you wait in line for ten (or more) minutes.

I would ask local and long distance phone company the the owner of the car
phone uses before setting one up and having people pay an individual for
phone use.  It could be construed (and rightly so) as merchanting, and then
the owner of the car phone would have to get a merchant's license etc.

If you would be setting up the phone for emergency calls coming in, ('Help,
I'm lost on 79S around exit 12') or (Get Lord So-and-So, his wife was in a
car accident,) it would be quite useful and the line wouldn't be tied up
with outgoing calls from Pennsic.

Before doing any of this I would check with the phone company you're planning
on using.

Gee, being that I am a woman fighter who recently squired, I think that 
I'm somewhat qualified to answer this...


No one can expect to be a squire without any work....  You have to 
get to know people and have them get to know you as a nice person
and a generally hard worker.....  They have to think that if I help this
person, they will help themselves enough to become a knight.......


You don't have to squire to a knight in your shire, or even in your 
kingdom.... One of my squire brothers is in the East....  If I read the
net address correctly, you're in NY mundanely, and I can't see that 
there are no knights in a city of several million people.... I know of 
at least one (but I'd NEVER want to be his squire).....  


When I first started fighting, I sat down with a knight who is a friend
of mine, whose advice I respect, but who is not my current knight....  
His advice to me was to fight for a while, find someone
whose style you liked, and squire to them...  So I fought, not just at
the local practice, and I basically developed my own style...  In the 
process I got an idea of what I would want in my knight, because
I sought help from a lot of white belts...


My knight approached me......  I had been felt out, in my estimation,
by him and other knights before, but I really wasn't ready to say
I liked his style or any other.....  But I was starting to feel a need
for someone to instruct me consistently, and who will always be on my 
side....  It's not as if I don't have good friends who are knights....
My cousin is King James Greyhelm, and I know several of the movers and
shakers in the kingdom.... I had had problems with people overfighting
me before, and they had come to my aid....   But it was time that I 
had someone of my own.....  Robert asked, and I knew how he treated
his other squire, and I thought that it would be a good situation for 
me.  So I said yes....


Robert is a Vicount of the Mists...  I had known him for over a year,
and had served on his court....  He's been in the Society for about 
10 years, and was trained by Maythen, a left-handed (like me)
woman knight.  He has two other squires, one in the East, and one
in the West.  My guess is that one of them may be knighted within the
next two years....  So, I'm not one of a brood of squires, and I won't 
get lost in the shuffle....  I found that I could never put up with 
that situation...  Robert's Western squire is quite independent, so
I will get a lot of individual attention....  At the same time, I 
have explicit permission to take lessons from other knights, so 
I will find out what works for me.  HM, for example, has been showing
me one of his backhand shots....  I am expected to provide service
for Robert, but this will probably consist of being on his courts, so 
I won't be his handmaiden.....  So I get instruction and support in 
return for service;  I think that this is a good situation
for me....


In spite of the fact that I knew a lot of knights, I doubt that 
I would have approached them..... I had a lot of people instructing
me, but my impression is that it would have been bad form...... 
I would also never squire to a knight that I was involved with, 
or that I might want to be involved with.  I would never say
yes to a squiring offer from a knight that I thought had other
intentions toward me.  That would likely result in a VERY sticky 
situation, if things went bad....


In service to the dream,

Laura Rydal of Grasmere, Squire of Vicount Robert of Woodsende

 Hi I was wondering if anyone would know of any place in Toronto where I 
could get Mediaeval re-creations.  I'm interested in items such as swords,
 shields, clothing, goblets etc.
I was also curious, what exactly is S.C.A all about. I know they re-
create the mediaeval atmosphere but what kind of things do they do? 
Last question, I was doing a project on Sir Malory's Morte D'Arthur and 
my oral presentation is on Chivalry.  Is there any place where I could 
get a "code of ethics" for knights?

I see a problem here that has not been addressed: Why did this come up
during the event at all?  

If live music is being played for a dance, would not it make sense for
the dance mistress and the jongleurs guild mistress to discuss the set
several weeks in advance.  That kind of coordination could easily
enhance everyone's enjoyment of the event.  The jonglers wouldn't wind
up sending time rehersing a dance that the dance mistress isn't
willing to run.  Instead, that time could be devoted to rehersing and
gaining confidence playing a piece that the musicians *knew* would be
danced.  Knowing in advance that certain dances would be played, the
dance mistress could try to go over these in the weeks preceding the
event, giving those of us who dance more confidence that we actually
knew what was going on when the dance was called.

Just tell them you have knee problems.  There is nothing wimpy or
dishonorable about wanting to be able to walk a few years from now.
It is unchivalrous to attempt to shame someone into doing something
that they *know* is beyond their limit.  (Speaking as someone who has

Subject: clarifications, invitation

Rialtans, greetings and best wishes!  I am putting two clarifications together
with my principal message in order to save ethereal parchment.  (I would not
want to be accused of being a killer of ether trees.)

Clarification 1: in my message about Caterina Sforza, "promoted" should have
been "prompted."  (I hate typos that look like misuse of language....)

Clarification 2: in my "Landmarks" message I made an admittedly exaggerated
statement about how those who treat others well in Mundania are looked down
upon.  At least one gentle took this to mean that the place I work is actually
as I depicted; this is not so, where I am now is better than any other place I
have worked at.  My picture was an average of all my experience plus those of
my friends, deliberately made a shade darker for rhetorical effect.

Invitation (the good part): I have made a happy discovery.  St. Joder's day is
August 16th, which this year is Thursday of Pennsic week.  Therefore I plan to
have a celebration of St. Joder's day in the Carolingian encampment, starting
around sunset and continuing until just before the camp's quiet time.  All
forms of entertainers (storytellers, dancers, etc.) are invited to attend; I
myself will tell the story of St. Joder and the Devil, and perhaps other
stories about the saint.  Currently I plan to supply drinks both wet and dry
:-) and an undetermined amount of food.  I also hope to give prizes in a manner
similar to Duke Cariadoc's giving of silver bands, based on my subjective
judgment.  More details will become available as I know more, and am able to
rope in more assistants.  If you wish to entertain, or have a friend who does,
please send me a message saying what sort of entertainment it is (and if
possible giving an estimated time for the performance).

I have two requests for those attending:

I would like this celebration to be at least half as authentic as the Enchanted
Ground (Duke Cariadoc uses a golden rope; imagine that I use a silver one).
What this rather vague statement means is that I would like people to try to
stay in persona and to avoid mundanity in their speech, but small things will
not bother me.

I would like this to be a place where religious aspects of one's *persona* can
exist without affront, whether these are Christian or otherwise.  (I would like
people to be more authentic and less hypersensitive, and I hope that giving
fair warning is sufficient to accomplish this.)

I will be happy to answer questions about any of the above.  If you need to
contact me quickly, I have an automatic scribe at (617)646-9240.

I would also greatly appreciate receiving any information about the original
St. Joder or any later one; outside of Switzerland he is generally called St.
Theodore, St. Theodul, or St. Theodulus.  There is at least one later St.
Joder, called the Carolingian St. Joder, and I believe there is at least one
more besides these two.  Information about period celebration of St. Joder's
day, or pointers to literature about him, would also put me in your debt.

Subject: SCA SLANG

I would like to thank all the gentles on the Rialto for their input to my 
little effort at collating SCA slang terms. As a folklorist, this sort of thing 
fascinates me.

I absolutely agree with the gentle Lady's comment about not being able to use 
many of these terms in forsoothly speech, and about the derogatory nature of 
some of the terms.....but my job is merely to collect, not to judge.
More input would be appreciated, as terms are used and/or discarded..language 
is, after all, a living thing, and thus evolves.
  
Perhaps it would behoove us all to think about "period" terms for much of
those slang words, and begin using these rather than the slang, when "in
persona."
  
"Chiurgeon" is, in period, pronounced "Surgeon," however. The point brought up 
by the gentle in regard to this usage is valid, and I am editing the list 
accordingly. This would be, perhaps, one term that * should * be used in a 
neo-medieval manner, not in correct period usage,
to avoid misunderstandings.....

Subject: Canadian Herald's Tabard

Unto those gentles who are working to produce a tabard for the Chief Herald
of Canada, I reproduce a letter appearing in the Spring 1990 issue of The
Coat of Arms, the quarterly journal of the Heraldry Society.

  From The Chief Herald of Canada

  Sir, Mrs. Jane Urwick referred to her distress and puzzlement over
  the appearance of what she interpreted was an official 'cloak'
  designed for the Chief Herald to wear on ceremonial occasions.  The
  facts are these.  The cloak was a gift created by friends and
  clooeagues and presented to me late July at a party at the Vancouver
  Museum given in honor of my wife and myself as we prepared to leave
  for Ottowa.  It was meant as a sartorial pun, having multiple arms,
  and was decorated with a combination of real and pseudo heraldic
  emblems.  I can assure Mrs. Urwick and the rest of your readership
  that it has absolutely no official status whatsoever.  Further, I can
  advise you that, as yet, no official ceremonial dress has been established
  for the Chief Herald or the other officers of the Authority.  When it is,
  I will ensure that detailed information about it is sent to our brother
  officers of arms and others who will be interested.  Hopefully, when such
  dress is established, Mrs. Urwick will feel that we have created dress
  of dignity and appropriate design impact, a worthy match to the evident
  simplicity of the Authority's new arms.

  Yours faithfully,

Mr. Watt's office before proceeding to far, lest the SCA acquire a reputation
as a bad joke.

Subject: Knights Equipment

As I recall from long ago, the ransom for a knight's equipment was
siginificantly less than the value of the equipment.  Thus winners were
provided with funds, but the losers were not bankrupted.  Presumably knights did
not participate in tournements unless their estate would support such a hobby.
Granted, the "professional" knights could earn substantial sums at tourney, but
I doubt all or evenmost of theknights depended on the tourneys for income.  I
suspect they mostly fought as we fight: for fame and fun.

And there were other prizes to be had.  Sponsers of the tourneys would give
out prizes, and other persons who thought somebody had done something
particulary notable might be moved to make a gift to someone he thought
deserved it.  Also the tourneys were a way to advertise oneself, and thereby
hopefully impress somebody and be able to become a vassal, or make a favorable
marriage, or achieve some other profit.  

And I'm sorry, William, there is already a comic book duck in the SCA.  I mean,
duke, I mean, oh, he'll probably hate me for telling, but Duke Laurelen, whose
mundane name is Howard, is jovially known as "Howard the Duke" after the Howard
the Duck cartoon.  I understand he detests the nickname...

Add Hilary of Serendip to the list....  There is also at least one

Not to my knowledge....  She is a countess;  however, she was a Queen

becoming the first Queen by her own hand....

A knight recently complained to me that there was a large gap in the
women fighters.  There are the ladies who are knights, and the ladies 
who have mastered the basics, but who aren't close to knighthood......
There is very little in-between...

There are a lot of reasons for this gap....  Some ladies don't like the
brusies....  Some ladies hate getting hit and feeling like they are 
getting beaten up.....  Some ladies haven't learned how to use their
bodies and don't hit hard enough to kill.....
More seriously and more commonly, some ladies dislike it when they
are not taken as seriously as the guys......  After all, most of us know

for lunch on the tourney field......  It's even worse when you run up

and support you....  I know of a specific example of this;  there was
a lady fighter in the Middle who was told that she couldn't be
authorized, because she wasn't good enough..  She had been fighting 
for over a year.......  She was a perfectly 
safe fighter, but she had been done royally wrong in terms of armor
and training...

Subject: authenticity versus fun

Unto the folk of the Rialto does Eliane Esperance, Guildmistress of the
Carolingian Guild of Jonglerus send greetings!

I write in response to Taran's note about the dance at the event.  I was
not only at the event, but I was trying to direct the band.  Pardon me
Taran, but I'm going to name a few (only a few!) names and make a small
suggestion.  The dance in question was the SCA Maltese Bransle; the music
usually used for it is the Schiarazula Marazula.  This is a wonderful piece
of music, and lots of fun to play.  The dance, admittedly is not one bit
period.  It was entirely made up.  I do not know enough about dancing to 
say whether the components that make it up are period, but I would guess not.

Now I get to play devil's advocate:  In period it was a popular thing to do
to write music, and dances.  In the SCA there are many people who try their
hand at imitating this very period practice, some with more success than
others.  I have come across some beautiful, stylistically correct pieces
of music written by SCA folk in the style of Morley, Dowland, Landini, 
and our old friend, anonymous.  Someone has already tried this with the SCA
Maltese Bransle, perhaps with not so much success.  What would the reaction of
the dance mavens be if a very educated dance scholar wrote a dance appropriate
to that particular style of music, and to the period in which it was written?

After all, we are trying to recreate a time when creation was a fad.  Everyone
wrote music (even kings), and *somebody* had to write the dances.  Why
should we only perform pieces that were written then, when so many people
want to write new ones now?  

Just curious.

  I tend to agree with your questioning here.  In my time period, (I can't 
speak for any other) the honorific for a king is "your Grace."  The reasoning
of this is that the king is king by "grace of God."  Oh yeah, my time is early
fourteenth century Scotland (some of us don't hold by the Romish church and 
their use of "Majesty", but rather by the Irish church which is older.)
  Here I don't worry about having to explain what I mean, I just let others
chaulk it up as a personality anomaly. ;^)
  
  You mention that you would only swear feality to a person, and not a "hat".
I don't see any difficulty here.  Just do your swearing in an off moment and 
not in court.  I don't think that any member of the royalty would be offended 
if you insist upon swearing a personal feality rather than a public "office"
feality.  Rather I think that such individuals would be touched, especially if
you "did it up right" and made the moment special.

Safer to ask; you may be pleasantly surprised.
The dance we do is a recognizable variation/arrangement of Arbeau's Maltese
Bransle.  The important differences are that we've simplified the steps and
compensated by using a suicide tune.

>After all, we are trying to recreate a time when creation was a fad.  Everyone

There are a number of wonderful dances of more or less modern provenance which
we do instead of "the real thing".  How many people do you know who would
rather dance the Quadrain Pavan than Earl of Salisbury?  How many do you know
who prefer Arbeau's Jouyessance to the more elaborate version that we do?
(That example actually has elements of red herring in it, as Arbeau is on 
somewhat shaky ground with this dance.)  For that matter, who wouldn't prefer
doing the Maltese Bransle (so called because a bunch of Maltese Knights made
it up one day) to Schiarazula Marazula than doing it to its rather dull 
original tune?

I don't think the debate is between the fun-loving majority and the stuffy
purists.  The debate, and a legitimate one it is, is over where (and under
what circumstances) to draw the line.  (I, for example, side with those who
would like to dance Hole in the Wall on alternate blue moons, as a novelty,
but would like to abolish its current status as a staple.)

The appropriate response to "We're not doing Maltese; it isn't period" was
not to draw fun-vs-authenticity battle lines.  We all want to have fun and
we're all interested in a reasonable level of authenticity.  That ought to
leave a lot of leeway for compromise.

Minor point of correction; King Kobold was actually the first book, published

Unto Wraith in particular and all in general,

Something you said:
" Milady, An Excellent Pattern Exists, It is a Vogue Pattern in a Prom
accesories Set, I have seen the pattern echoed ina pattern set given to me on
period Gloves, so it is a reasonable one..."
makes me shudder.
  Asserting that some modernly available pattern is a good 
period pattern because it was included in *someone's* set of period patterns
is a dangerous thing to do unless you know that that `someone' has done at least
a bit of research on the subject. We already have loads of mis-information
being passed on as truth or good ideas because `sombody said it'.

If instead you could say: *
" Milady, the Vogue pattern #xxxx is quite period, one very like it is to be
found in Lady Phalangia's collection of period glove patterns, accompanied by
a close-up of a painting by Brughel/Holbein/Durer showing what appears to be
a glove of the same pattern..." 

with that I would feel secure enough to go ahead and make them and look forward
having only scholarly discussions about my gloves from then on.

Greetings!

   I will be married this summer (86 days and counting) in a
Renaissance-style wedding.  The invitations have been sent, a
period costumer is making authentic garb for us, the site has
been approved, the rings have been purchased, a harpist has been
hunted for -- all seems in readiness.....well,......almost in
readiness.  It seems that the member of my wedding party I asked to
help hunt for information on period ceremonies, is too busy recovering
from surgery to be of much help, and I'm too busy pulling overtime
to spend much time doing literature searches at the library to find
likely looking titles and delve into them for the one tidbit they might
contain on the actual ceremony.  If any of you good gentles out there
could help this fledgling bride-to-be with helpful titles of texts,
or just helpful tidbits of information on Elizabethan Renaissance
ceremonies, I would be eternally grateful.  At this point I'm not very
picky -- I'll take religious or pagan rituals from England or Ireland.

My many thanks,

Generally, the best resource for information on what it's really like
at Pennsic is people in your local group (officers, etc.--that's part
of their job).

Additionally, I have a little booklet available for anyone who would
like further reference materials.  It has evolved through workshops
conducted for newer members here in the Shire of Cynnabar, and contains
various apochrypha from the Public Domain.  I can't claim it's the last
word on preparing for Pennsic, but a couple of people have recommended
I make it available outside my local group.

I can e-mail it to you (with or without some very pretty Microsoft Word

Actually, this depends on the year (much as fashion today). I am 
posting from work, so I do not have my references handy, but there was a 
shift from gorgeous to austere toward the end of the 16th century. I 
recall reading of a fashion contest in which the winner wore a simple 
antique black kimono, whilst the others were bedecked as peacocks. Many 
of my sources include large samples of stage costumery, presumably they 
show the widest ranges of decoration techniques. The real clothing is 
easy to distinguish from these, though. It is true that the period 
Japanese color sense is quite different from the Western ideal. Also 
realize that most sources today (existing textiles and artworks) tend to 
show more complicated textiles than were worn day-to-day. The Japanese 
artist seemed to have a preoccupation with representing clothing. Even 
their erotic art seems to have the subjects in a multitude of colorful 
clothing, while existing kimono are naturally the best garments which 
weren't common clothing.

I thank you for posting this dictionary...it is delightful.  However,
I would point out that most of the terms on your list which are either

I've never heard most of them.  To take a glaring example, the term "eric" is

I think the lesson is once again that the SCA is a much more diverse

Greetings from William de Corbie!

FARSPEAKING:
Someone mentioned that there are 6000 people at Pennsic and only one phone
line. I have never attended the war, so I don't know where this phone is
located - but I would guess it belongs to the Coopers.

Here is a suggestion: Couldn't the Society get one of those car phones that
one can remove from the car and place in a pavillion. It would only need to
be connected to the phone system during the weeks around the war. The number
could be listed under "War office" or "Pennsic war". Or it could appear in
SCA newsletters. I believe the hardware could be leased. A "Farspeaker
pavillion" might be provided and green pieces of paper demanded for the
use of this magic device. Possible?

WRAPAROUND EFFICIENCY:
Suggestion: Take one old 16-gauge SCA helm and put a melon inside. Nail
the helm to a sturdy log set in the ground. Then attack it with a steel
sword, using wraparound blows. Check the sword for melon juice, and post
the result to the Rialto. End of speculations.

psychological and verbal components of self defense, and I would be more
than happy to teach a class on it at Pennsic if any female gentles out there

Greetings from Ellisif!

William de Corbie suggested acquiring a car phone or equivalent for Pennsic,
and charging people for the use of it.

There are two pay phones on site (and the lines get quite long at times), so
outgoing calls aren't that much of a problem.  The only phone designed to
take incoming calls is the one in the Coopers' store.  Back in the days of
single-digit Pennsic numbers, it was permissible to call that number and 
leave messages for people on site.  (There was a message board outside the
store; it was up to people to check this board.  You couldn't ask to speak
with someone on site; that would have been a nightmare even then.)  But the 
days of small Pennsics are gone, and I suspect the Coopers decided that this
was too much trouble.

If a phone were provided for incoming calls, how would you collect payments
for its use?

I do not know anything about car phones, but I would suspect that there would
be a lot of cost and aggrivation involved in getting the phone company to
set up service for two weeks a year.

Ioseph,
I found the dictionary of SCA slang interesting and at times
entertaining.  You defined some useful terms for some of us,
especially newcomers (terms like: ASCAC, C.E., golem *a good
euphemism*, Rialto).  However, I wish there weren't so many
derogatory terms there.  I know you didn't invent them, and
I'm not flaming you, but at least two of them are nasty and
sexist: Crownie and Fubba-Wubba.  My response to these is I
wish 1- they didn't exist and 2- wish there were no reason to
use them.  I hadn't encountered Conan-clone either, but that
term doesn't strike me as too nice either.  I guess my last
comment is symptomatic in the Society, but you can't say hardly
any of this stuff *in persona*.
I know a lot of slang is in good fun but it would seem to me
to be about impossible to uphold the ideals of chivalry while
using some of the terms listed.  Perhaps we should try to be
more positive.

I know of a few happenings from Pennsic before last.  Most were due to
interpersonal relationships going awry.  I'm not going into details, and
in any case these didn't affect other people.

The one that wasn't was some people doing shinai fighting along the
footpaths at some time after midnight.  It was a bit odd and almost
scary to have these odd cracking sounds and running feet behind me.
(I'd never heard shinai before).  This could've been a bit dangerous --
it was **DARK** enough that I simply couldn't see them until we passed
out from under the trees, and even then just barely.  I didn't know
what was going on -- maybe one of the "raids" was getting a tad bit out
of hand?  Or it could have been some people seriously fighting each other?
Fortunately they were just playing around..

Shortly afterward a couple of security people went by and we pointed 'em in
the right direction..

In general -- I've always felt very safe at events.  That doesn't stop me
from play acting certain things like protecting "the camp" from intruders.
Or that I wear knives on my person for protection (true anyway) and that
there's people around who'd do me in if I wasn't (false..).  After all,
the personal protection biz that I play act was serious business in period.

  In the shire of Unser Hafen we practice the "adopted brother/sister" approach
to fostering new-comers.  When a new person shows up someone either volunteers
or is appointed to make themselves available at most times for this persons
questions and event introductions.  This gets the person into the group very 
quickly and gives them someone to help them make garb, learn a skill that they
are interested in, get to events (know of events,) etc.  We also give them an
issue of the Tosspot, which is the local newsletter.  With this, she/he will 
get a phone list of the shire and we have them fill out an interest form that
was created by our (then A&S minister) now Herald to get them in touch with 
folks with their same interests.
  Twice a month we have dance practice, which is better attended than many of 
the surrounding areas weekend events!  If the newcomer is a man, the ladies 
will descend upon him and make sure that he dances, if woman, then Titus, our
seneschal will do so, he can charm the pope out of his hat, this almost always
makes the newcomer dance, and they ALWAYS have a good time.
  A great idea of our current seneschal was to separate the populace meeting
from the EC (Executive Council) meetings.  The officers all get together, do 
their thing at the EC meeting and only report during the Populace meeting/revel.
At the populace revel every month we have guest speakers who speak on their
areas of expertise, usually some historical period, costuming, armoring, etc...
This meeting is open to the public and is advertised to get newcomers.  It is
also quite entertaining.
  Lastly, about 3 times a year I hold a newcomers revel where various folks
get up and explain the ideals and etiquette of the SCA.  This covers everything
from how to kiss a lady's hand to whether or not you should remove your steel
whenever you enter the Royal Presence.  We are currently working on creating a 
handbook of SCA etiquette for new and old members alike to discuss the fine
points of behavour.

  Whew!  This was a long posting for me.  Anyway, thats what we do, it seems to
work pretty well.

Carpe Diem!

Tourney ransom/ Knightly overhead:

  Being a knight was expensive.  The main reason for it's decline in the
  12th century was probably due to this expense.

  "The price of knightly equipment, too, had mounted to the point where the
  initial outlay might cost a knight a year's income."  - 'The Knight in
  History'; Frances Gies

  Some prices I have extracted are...
  Genoa - first half of 13th century:
    * Helm - 16-32 shillings
    * Hauberk 120-152 shillings; with accessories approx. 200 shillings.
  I also have a reference to William Marshal getting a horse worth over
  40 pounds for only 7 pounds through craftiness.

  What the expected yearly income for a knight was...I don't know.  Does
  anyone have some fiqures?

  Apparently tourney rules varied a great deal.  SOMETIMES armour and horses
  were ransomed.  SOMETIMES ransoms were arranged BEFOREHAND.  While a high
  ransom was seen as expressing the worth of the captive and was not looked
  badly upon.  Ransom raising seems to have been a collective effort at the end
  of a tourney.  This means that you could afford to pay more ransom through
  friends than you could alone.  Also knights were not unknown to ...DEBT.

  "In England, as the cost of knighthood increased, some knights with small
  landholdings clubbed together to pay the expenses of the service of one
  of their number". - 'The Knight in History'; Frances Gies 

  A clause in the Magna Carta forbids the gift or sale of land equivalent
  to a knight's fee thereby owning the service of a knight.  While many
  had to pledge their lands and armor to raise money.

  WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN?...Well for one thing knights may have had
  fame, but very few had fortune.  Yes, some even went Chapter 11.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wraparounds:
------------

> .... I think if I attempted a wrap blow I could easily break my wrist.

I don't see why?  I hear references to wraps being hard on wrists.  However
most styles of wraps put the strain farther up - on the tendons above the
elbow (Tennis elbow anyone).

I do not know anything about wraps being used in actual combat.  I had
been told for years that it was unlikely, due to the lack of force you
would be able to generate.  Then I got a wooden pell.  I was very
surprised that I could throw a good solid wrap - CONSISTENTLY.  It did
not skitter off, it was not light (it was not even a tip), it was a...a...
KILL (ok, ok, maybe the pell didn't die, but it wanted too).  I have since
moved and no longer have the pell (or backyard) and cannot continue to
test different shots.

As I already stated I have no evidence that wraps WERE used, I am however
convinced that they would work.

> 4) This last point is one of practicality. Why would someone try to go through

> to strike at? 

Why was this one of the 'best armoured places' in the first place?
Actually it wasn't...early helms tended to be caps, protecting the top
of the head only.  However helms evolved to protect more and more of the
back of the head, until finally the lobster tail helms came out of it.
The fact that people felt they needed the back of their heads protected
demonstates that they were getting hit there - was the wrap one of the
culprits?

One more bit of non-conclusive evidence:  Why did people use two-edged
swords?  A two-edged blade is harder to produce then a single-edge.
A single-edged sword is stronger, and hits with more weight behind it.
True a two-edged blade is lighter, but the emphasis seemed to be in
getting through the armor, not 'to it faster'.  I know of no other uses
for the back edge.  The upper back may have aided in thrusting, however
we see two-edged blunted swords.  I have not heard of anyone 'rotating'
the blade when the front edge became dull.  This is all very puzzling.

  Me neither!!...NEXT!

I have just instructed one of the Daemons under my control to forward

Whereas Carolingia is more a state of mind than a collection of ZIP

If you wish my Daemon to send you these letters, send a message to:

If you wish to direct a message to those on the list, send it to:

The Daemon does not Digest any of the messages it forwards, but merely
passes them on as it gets them, one by one.  (In fact, the Daemon is
prone to occasional indigestion, but I digress..).

This is not intended to replace or supplant any of the discussion on
the Rialto; rather, it is intended for things, perhaps of a relatively
time-critical nature, which are likely not of interest to those far
outside of Carolingia, such as announcements, calls for help, attempts
at carpooling to events, etc.,

I created this list because there seemed to be some need for such a

Subject: new member grabbing

It is possible to educate and support new members without inducting them into
one's household.  I have done this often.  I have oftne joked that I was the
Gold Key for my group because I was happy to explain thigns to the new people,
loan them costumes, make them costumes, scrounge them dinnerware, etc.  Very
few of these people became members of my household.

What I object to about new member grabbing is that they deprive the rest of us
of the new members.  Cliques do exist in SCa, and I'm sure it is delightful for
a new memeber to discover they've been adopted into a politically powerful and
improtant household, nonetheless, this steams the rest of us who feel ignored
and deprived.  In meeting new people, I've educated them about the basics of
SCA,a nd then watched them get sucked up by some brass hat with a big ego, only
to never be able to talk them again.  After all, by being a part of a large
household they have a happy and complete tiem at SCA, they don't need to bother
with anybody outside the household because they've got plenty of people within
it.  Thus those of us with small, widely scattered, or no household feel like
the odd man out.  

Worse, some groups will actively discourage people form having anything to do
with certain other groups.  I remember being a new person and being warned to
stay away from the Evil Dark Horde. So I stayed away.  After all, when you're
new to a group and you have to trust other people's opinions.  I wouldn't want
to find myself in distress, after all.  As it turns out, in my opnion the
members of hte Dark Horde are far more chivalrous thant he average SCa person.
It was a lady of the DArk Horde whom I had never seen before who said, "You're
sick, come with me."  And she then supplied me with orange juice and tissues, a
hot fire,a nd company until I felt better.  And I have no idea what her name
was, and have never seen her again.  Who ever you were, thank you.

And it was the Dark Horde that took in, sheltered, fed, and warmed several
dozen drenched, cold bodies at Pennsic when a rather a lot of tents were
flooded.  And they did it again the next year, and thereafter established the
Dark Horde emergency relief plan to handle the housing and care of large
nubmers of unfortunates.  

I rember also when Korok Starbear disqualified himself from a battle he very
much wanted to fight.  He was overheating and withdrew to the sidelines to
recover.  A gentle offered him a drink, and he accepted, only to discover that
it was wine, not water.  Having swallowed one mouthful of wine he withdrew from
the battle because he believed that no amount of alcohol was acceptable for a
fighter.

So some groups are good, and some are not.  some lords seem to want to have a
lot of people in their hosueholds so that they can make a grand entrance ont he
field of battle.  This is nothing but an ego trip.  some groups like to have
new people because it enables them to serve their fellow Scadians.  And some
groups think they're doing their groups a favor, but they manage to step on a
lot of toes along the way.  I'd rather see guilds than households because the
requirement into a household is that you be pleasing to the head of the
household.  A guild can be joined by anyone interested in the guild's subject.
And when household's monopolize some art or science, then it becomes very
difficult for a non member to pursue that art or science.

Subject: Security at Pennsic, Small children

Ladies, Lords, Gentles all,
  Unto the Rialto doth Signigraoulph of Kenmore cast greetings!
 
     I've been thinking over my experiences at Pennsic, and some of the posts
  on the subject of security that have appeared over the past week or so,
  and would like to add some comments.
 
     One Lady tells of being advised to travel the Pennsic camp escorted
  at all times, and many replies followed.  I am afraid that I, too, would
  advise that ladies do not travel alone for any appreciable disatnce at
  Pennsic in the evenings.  The Escort could be another lady. My reasonings?
  Pennsic is a now a bloody huge encampment, and it appears doubly so in the
  dark.  There are a multitude of places to get lost, and even more to trip
  over tent lines, encampment boundary markers, etc.  Also, unfortunatly,
  I fear greatly that, given the size that the PEnnsic encampment *has*
  gotten to, that the grim spectre of assault is a real probability.
 
    Whereas there would likely be the instant response described in the event
 of any disturbance of a lady's peace, the prospect of having to deal with
more
 than one person would be liable to "put a damper" on the enthusiasm of an 
 attacker.  Enough has already been said in this forum on the subject of rape
 being a crime of violence, and not passion.  I would, though, like to help to
 heighten the awareness of another problem that has been disturbing mine own 
 sensibilities over the last few Pennsics.  This is the verbal harrasment that
 I have seen occuring during the daytime, by an element of the Pennsic 
 population described by the Pennsic Tidings as "men in loincloths and 
 sunglasses."  That the situation is prevalent enough to be described in the
 Tidings shows that it is indeed more than just a chance occurance.  This is
 not a case of misunderstood flirtation, but something more serious.

    On the subject of smalls at SCA events.  If there is not an arrangement of
 some sort made beforehand, either privatly with individuals who are going
 to the same event, or, in the case of an event where there will be 
 "sanctioned" activities for children, that the autocrat in charge of children
 knows that you are bringing smalls, please do not bring them.

    I am divorced, and brought my younger son to one Pennsic.  No dire
 accidents, no dread faux pas, but, such as I love him, 'never again.' 
 The stress of keeping track of him, the limitations on mobility, the total
 absence of time for myself at the War, all contribute to this decision.
 To take him  again would be to resent him being there.  I have "done time"
 at events supervising children, both during sponsored kinder-watch, and
 when I've been  trying to find the parents of a child lost.  They are lovely,
 they are the long-term future of the SCA, but we must still be aware of the
 effort that is required.

   This is not an effort I@want to impose upon those unwilling, or who have
  not agreed to it beforehand.

Subject: gloves

Lady Anora de Sylveaston wrote an article on glove making, but I forget where
it was published.  I rember noting that according to Lady Annora, it was
amazing how bad one could make the gloves and still have them fit, so glvoe
making is apparently not as difficult as one might think with all those little
pieces to put together.

Knitted gloves are quite easy, in fact, and several period ones are pictured in
Richard Rutt's A History of Handknitting.  

Basically the easiest way to make a pair of gloves is to lay your hand on a
piece of fabric and trace around it.  Allow extra for seam allowance and cut
two.  Sew them together.  to get more freedom of movement, cut the thumb
separately and sew it on at an angle.  I suppose that doesn't make sense.

Gloves without fingers were also used in occupations where the sensitivity of
the fingertips was needed.  Mittens are easiest of all, and were made in
several styles, including thumbless, thumbed, one fingered and two fingered.  I
haven't seen anything I'd call a muff.  Thumbless mittens help the thumb stay
warm by having it in the same space as the fingers.  Mittens with various
numbers of fingers give more mobility to the hand.  Mittens with one or two fingers
were used for shooting guns and probably bows in cold weather.  Such mittens
are still known as "shooting gloves"

If one is to judge by surviving ethnic patterns of knitted gloves and mittens,t
the medeival mitten was pointed at the fingers.  This is the easiest way to get
a regular and neat finish to the mittens, and since medeival people liked
points ont ehir shoes, they probably went for the same on their mittens and
gloves.  Baltic etnic and northern European ethnic mittens and glvoes are built
this way. In addition, they have tight fitting, ribbed cuffs.  They were made
of wool

Spanish and Mediterannean gloves (circa 16 and 17th centuries) have flared
cuffs. They were made of cotton and silk, as well as wool.  The Spanish gloves
I have seen pictured were all eccesiastical gloves, and bore religious symbols
on the backs of the hands.  They were also white, the design being done in red
or some other color. The purpose of these gloves is apparently ritual, whereas
the northern gloves were practical.  The eccesiastical gloves were copied in
secular dress where they were an affection of the upper classes, the climate
not requiring such protection.  Be ware, few gloves survive, and so the
historians specualte from limited data.  On the other hand, gloves are one of
the more common knitted articles to survive.  Knitted garments being used as underwear
and work clothes, they were usually worn to shreds, and nobody thought it worth
perserving them. 

So much for gloves.

I have been following the discussion of households and newcomers
with great interest, and want to throw in my two pence.

When I first encountered the Society in 1978, I lived in the
Barony of the Stargate (Houston).  It was a BIG barony, and my first
event was Atenveldt Crown Tourney.  Not a particularly hospitable time
to show up not knowing anyone or anything!  I was almost immediately
welcomed by members of House Morningstar, who "adopted" me on a
short-term basis.  They provided me with people to hang around with,
camp with, and to show me the ropes.  They introduced me to members of
guilds for things I was interested in, and encouraged me to not limit my
baronial contact to the household members.  Eventually, about four
months after I first showed up, I was formally invited to join the
Household.

Then I moved to another Kingdom.  Not having had the benefit of
the Rialto discussions about moving to a new place :), I had trouble.
The biggest loss was the Household.  The new shire didn't have them (at
least as far as I could tell), and since I didn't have people to hang
around with and was basically shy, I eventually drifted away.  I know
that others have felt the same in other communities.

Now I live in yet another Kingdom (my mundane life keeps me
moving!).  I'm not in a household here, either, but through the Rialto,
I have found someone one who is helping me feel at home.  (Thanks,
Ariel!)

I think new people need other people to hang around with in order
to feel connected.  Whether that takes the form of households or
something else depends on the community.  I may be moving to Carolingia
this summer, so may get a chance to try things in yet another place!

Greetings,

I have a couple of questions for the veteran Pennsic attendees.
Is Pitsburg the closest airport?  What kind of site fee should
I exspect?  Is there a shuttle from the airport to the site?

Also-
Any suggestions of things I might need to bring that I wouldn't 
have thought of coming from California?

Thank you,

At the risk of sounding uncaring or inconsiderate, I say, "So?"

(Now that I have your attention... ;^)

While not at all denying that this is possible, there is a wide gray line here.
Rape is definitely a serious thing.  And, yes there are wiles and methods to
terrorize or in some other way reduce a person to agreeing to something they would
not normally have agreed to.  This sort of behaviour is reprehensible, and in fact
criminal as far as I'm concerned.

Unfortunately, to an outsider, there is little way to tell what is going on unless
someone calls for help in many of these instances.

Now, this discussion _IS_ helpful to anyone that might find themselves in a situation
where they are in jeopardy of such rape happening to them.  However, I think it comes
down to "Say, 'No' clearly and with conviction.  If that doesn't help, and you don't
think that you are going to be able to make that stick on your own, call for help.
Be prepared to explain the problem, if only to say to those that appear, 'This lord/lady
apparently does not understand that I wish to be left alone.  Is it possible for you
to explain this to him/her as I can not?'"  Above all, and this is by far one of the
hardest things to do, remain calm, and _keep_thinking_rationally.  Easy words, I know,
but hard to put into practice since almost all of the methods create a situation
wherein you are _forced_ to _stop_ thinking rationally..

Also, note that some of the methods mentioned above by Awilda can be and have been used
by ladies on lords.  Rape doesn't just happen to females, although violent rape of a male
by a female probably doesn't occur as often as the other way around.

Secondarily, it is important to realize that if you ARE being subjected to advances,
importunities, lewd behaviour, objectionable behaviour, or downright rape, it's
_NOT_ that something's wrong with you - as long as you've stated your objections
clearly.

There are times that the "antagonist" can quite honestly misread your reactions.  Make
sure that if an advance is not welcome that you state so clearly and in such a way that
there can be no doubt of what you wanted/didn't want.

Then kill'em.

Hopefully, though, support and words of advice will forestall many incidents
of this sort.

Oh, and BTW, please don't think that I'm trifling "rape" through the use of words
like "incident".  It's my paramedic training coming through - using words that are
not emotionally laden in order to talk rationally about things.

Replace "women" with "people", and I'll agree with you 100%.  As it is, I only agree
with you 50%.

>Is Pitsburg the closest airport?  

Pittsburgh is the closest airport, but it's close to an hour's drive so don't
plan on taking a cab.  There are shuttle services of some sort available.
The Pennsic information in the June newsletters contains a number to call for
more information on this.  Pennsic itself does not sponsor a shuttle, and you
will call down the wrath of the autocrat and/or the Coopers if you call the
site from the airport and ask to have someone pick you up.  (There are ~6000
people at Pennsic.  There is one incoming phone line.)

>What kind of site fee should I exspect?

I *think* the weekend rate this year is $20 for members, $30 otherwise.  This
covers Friday (the 17th) through Monday.  Each additional day is, I think,
$4 this year.  I pasted the camera-ready Pennsic info directly into the 
June Pikestaff and sent it off to the printer last week, so I actually don't
have the info on hand to quote.  Sorry.  I can post more in a week.  If
you're coming out for the land grab. plan to spend around $65 for site fees.
The Coopers do not take checks or plastic; bring cash or travellers' checks.

>Any suggestions of things I might need to bring that I wouldn't 
>have thought of coming from California?

Clothing for wet and/or cold weather, as well as for very warm weather.
Daytime temperatures are in the 90s; nighttime temperatures are highly 
variable and *can* get down into the 30s, though ~50s is more common.
Plan for serious rain; it'll happen at least once during the week.

Subject: Female knights

There are at least 5 female knights in the Society that I know of:

Trudy Lacklandia (Atenveldt)
Methen (West)
Andrea (West)
Bulverk (I think she was knighted West of the Missisippi, but I think of her
         as a Midrealmer).
Fern (de la Foray?) Midrealm, moved to Atlantia.

Personally, I condider Morgan Elandris a knight, but her lack of single combat
skill has prevented any Eastern king from agreeing.

I believe Andrea is a Vicountess by her own hand.
Since I remember William of Houghton making "Laddie of the Rose" jokes, Methen
might well be a vicountess by her own hand.

I think a woman won a Drachenwald coronet tournament relatively recently
(succeeding Ivar, eventually). I think her name is Catherine, but I could
easily be wrong.

I know of only one competent single combat female fighter currently in the
East: Bearengaria (not Countess Bearengaria, this one lives in the Debatable
Lands).

I suspect this list is neither complete nor conclusive.

Subject: households

There has been much discussion recently on the subject of households--
both for and against.  It seems to me that one of the problems is that
there are not guidelines for joining a household.

If someone is standing off to the side at an event, and no one happens
to take notice of them to help them learn about the SCA, they really
don't know how to approach a household.  Or, at least, that's how it
was with me three years ago.  There were several prominent households,
none of which seemed very approachable, and even if I had been able to,
I would not have been able to say why one household rather than another.

the idea of a barony household, or some other group that was immediately
open to anyone interested sounds good to me.  After six months of being
exposed to SCA life, I think it would be easier to choose a household
one would like to approach about becoming a member, or at least have an
idea HOW to do so.

                                -Ioseph of Locksley 
 
        The Common Speech of any sub-culture uses technical terms and slang  
 that indicates solidarity among the membership. The SCA is no exception. 
        This is by no means a complete list of slang terms used in the SCA, 
 nor do I pretend that all of these terms are used everywhere in the Known 
 Worlde, but these are the ones I have found so far. 
        I have avoided including specialized terms used in sub-systems of  
 the SCA that the average member would not come in contact with, nor have I 
 listed medieval/Renaissance terms that were used in period. Most of what we 
 have here is slang of the Current Middle Ages.

You forgot trick knees, they are not obvious until they give out and one 
screams in pain while falling down. I know I have have them. There are times 
when I am asked why I don't fight any longer in both Markland and the SCA, it 
is awkward to reply without sounding like a wimp. Any suggestions? Thanks.

Well, if you ever meet me at Pennsic, tell me, I feel it is my duty to be 
courteous to you and speak such that you can see my lips moving. I do not 
consider it an imposition to be informed that the person to whom I am speaking 
is hard of hearing. I grew up in a neighborhoos 
 in which there were several hard of hearing children and twp autistics, 
we never treated them any different than ourselves and we all had a good time. 
Please excuse my early morning typos, thanks.

No insult is intended to honorable fighters, note that I did not name any 
particular person(s). Stick/swordjock refers to those who only fight and show 
no interest in the other areas of medievalism. Rhinohide refers to fighters who 
routinely ignore good clean blows and hit way too hard for the game, that is 
what this is after all. Also note that at no time did I use the word "liar".

You must be using odd swords (real ones not the sticks) since all of my real 
blades weighed far less than their stick counterparts. I have had my chainmail 
driven into the flesh of my shoulder from wrap shots with steel, I fight 
Markland, but no worse has happened with the real thing. An axe, mace or 
morningstar on the other hand will break bones at least, not to mention 
warhammers.

A mighty good idea you have there Sir.   
 
Again, no insult was inteneded, I used the terms that most people are familiar

yesterday and found that things around here have become saner since I fought 
SCA, which was in 1982-1983. Thank you.

     At the Atlantian Crown Tourney held in the Barony of Lochmere
last Saturday (May 5, XXV) there were many mighty blows thrown and
taken.  When the dust cleared and the semi-finalists emerged, those
four fighters were:  Master Robyyan Torr D'Elandris paired with His
Grace Duke Sir Olaf Askoldsson, and Lord Cedric of Thenay (sp) paired
with Viscount Sir Cai de Lyon (also known to some as Gaius).  Prior to
the commencement of the semi-finals, all losses were thrown out and to
advance to the finals one had to win two out of three fights.  The fi-
nalists were  His Grace and His Lordship.  After three extremely well-
fought bouts, His Grace became His Royal Highness.  Vivat!
    Then there was the court and feast and post-revel...

Subject: Re: Random mead-brewing question

I spoke recently to the master of the Brewers Guild in Carolingia and 
I will relay his comments on this observed phenomenon - I cannot verify 
it for myself, but thought the point ought to be made.

His summary is that alcohol in the 2-liter soda bottles made with plastic
is a bad thing.  Those containers (like the plastic ones that come with
water coolers) are made for water-based beverages ONLY.  Alcohol based
beverages "eat" (i.e. disolves) some of the plastic and adds it to your
beverage.  The smell you have reported is from that process - He says 
he's drunk such contaminated mead and suffered no ill effects, but 
doesn't promise the same for other people.

My suggestion is to only brew in GLASS or an approved plastic (available
at brewing supply stores in your area).  And - wash/sterilize such bottles
thoroughly!

Also - try this experiment next time you have a successful batch of mead
available:  pour a bit into a glass, a ceramic mug, a wood goblet and a 
pewter or silver goblet.  Now do a taste test.  I find that the glass and
ceramic (if glazed) provide a superior taste, so I always drink my mead
out of glass mugs or glazed ceramic.

				Good Luck and safe brewing !

Perhaps "glossy" could be replaced by "recyclable" ?  Aside from that

Subject: Re: The losers; also calibration whim

It was suggested that the ransom price for armour and horse was inexpensive as
an example of the golden rule. This may be true, but I think there may have
been a simpler explanation. The markdown may have occurred simply because
selling the booty to show a profit took both time and expertise at selling.

Before you think me crazy, think of the modern American pastime, popular in
the '50s and '60s, of "racing for pink slips". Roughly speaking, you would
soup up your car to go as fast as it could, find a convenient 1/4 mile, and
race against some other hero who had done likewise. Winner takes both cars.
Since the winner generally doesn't need 2 cars (particularly at 3 am in a
strange town), the winner generally sold the car back to the loser for a
fraction of its book value. This kept the hassle to a minimum: no need to move
and store the car, no need to find a buyer, no need to give a cut to the
government. I don't know that the medieval tourney fighter was under similar
constraints, but I wouldn't be surprised to find he was.

Gavin (hi, Gavin) claims that because he can dent a 14 gauge helm with rattan,
he could break a medieval helmet with steel, while throwing a wrap blow. 
Though it might be true, consider the following:

1) You can do things with a rattan weapon that is difficult with a real
weapon. Cariadoc has a "slashing spear" I've played with a little. If I had to
use it in combat, I'd try handing it to my opponent and waiting for his arms
to wear out. It is a thoroughly useless weapon. Yet I could make a SCA
equivalent that would be deadly. My lady has a falchion made by Kirby I gave
her several years ago. It is a near replica of falchion A710 in the Wallace
Collection catalogue. I think if I attempted a wrap blow I could easily break
my wrist. Granted, I'm a halberdier, not a swordsman, so this might just prove
I don't know how to throw a wrap correctly. 

2) If a correctly executed wrap is effective, it still might be hard to
achieve in practice. One thing that is true for bludgeoning-type swords that
is not true for rattan weapons is that they have definite edge
characteristics. If you start swinging a sword around, and tilt it a little
so that the edge is no longer cutting the air, you tend to hurt yourself. The
weapon slows down dramatically all of a sudden.

3) I think the glancing affects of a helmet on a real sword may be more
pronounced than on a rattan weapon. It could well be easier to shrug off a
real blow by tilting your head than it is in SCA combat. 

4) This last point is one of practicality. Why would someone try to go through
one of the best armoured places on the body when there are far easier targets
to strike at? To a limited extent, this is even true in SCA combat. If a
person doesn't acknowledge a blow in a well armoured place, one strategy is to
hit them in a poorly armoured place.

Anyway, all this leads me to conclude I don't have the foggiest notion of
whether the wrap blow was a medieval technique against a steel-helmeted
person, or not.

Greetings, all, from Ariel.

To Hrothgar Hrolfsson: S&M War never means exactly the same thing from year to 
year.  The first year we had one, our opponent was Seashire.  The second year,
it was Stonemarche.  The third year it was "Sivilization" (the Veassls can't
read, let alone spell ;-) ), and the fourth year it will be "Survivors" from 
the Boredom War.  Therefore, there will not be a Stonemarche-Malagentia War this
year... but there will be an S&M War.  We're looking forward to seeing your
household there again!

Colin Mackay: Thanks.  I'll try to get it through using Elizabeth's address.
Here goes...

On the care and feeding of new people: our shire has mushroomed in the past 
couple of years, and it was about all we could do to deal with the new growth.
We've started having monthly or biweekly shire get-togethers in different parts
of the state (in addition to our weekly practices and our meetings).  At these
get-togethers, we bring our weapons, our arts projects, and whatever else we're
doing.  This makes for great show-and-tell, and people know whom to talk to
about the things that interest them (sort of like an internal demo).  In
addition, we're setting up some "how-to" nights where people can learn about
how to make T-tunics, submit names and devices, and so on.  (Heraldry 101 will 
never go out of style.) 

All interested ladies are automatically invited to join the Bitches' Guild --
they're the ones who make the communal supplies (like tabards, mead, etc.).
They also drink wine, swap patterns, loan books, peel vegetables, organize
shopping trips to the fabric mills and art supply outlets, keep the water
and Gatorade flowing, and assorted other good works.

We're still getting things to work and setting up new ones...

And again I see it. Why, oh why, does the word "household" immediately
evoke "clique" in so many people? Although Cher does acknowledge, more or less,
that this isn't so everywhere, this really makes it sound like joining a
household before you know exactly what you're doing is like stepping into
a bear's cave carrying a honey jar. While this may be so in some places,
it simply is *not* the case in many others, and households can become
downright *necessary* in some circumstances.

So much is said against households, I sometimes wonder if we're the only
group that doesn't have these problems. Carolingia has around 12-15
households and household-like groups (the boros, our college groups,
are somewhere between households and cantons in structure), about as
many active guilds and proto-guilds, and we have not had these political
disasters that everyone keeps talking about. What are we doing 
differently?

I also point out that the above attitude is based on the assumption that
people can only belong to one household, which would certainly promote
this sort of factionalism. Why is this so? I've been associated pretty
closely with four or five "households" over the past seven years, and
hang out with at least half-a-dozen more. What we have here is not a 
problem with households, it's a problem with peoples' attitudes towards
them...

>care to take the time or trouble.

Okay, let me put my problem with this in concrete terms. Carolingia gets
in the ballpark of 60-100 new potential members per year. Let me repeat
that: *per* *year*. And that's not counting the vast numbers who are just
curious, which is probably double that; this is just the people who evince
some real interest. I cannot see *any* way that this can be coped with,
without a household structure, or something very like it. It's all that
the Magisterium (the office in charge of new members) can do to keep on
top of the basic information packets that have to be sent out, much less
actually acculturate people.

It's here that the households become truly necessary. With this kind of
influx of newcomers, the job of acclimating them can't be fobbed off on an
office, no matter how large. Everyone needs to help out. The newcomers
need to be taken under peoples' wings, shown the ropes, and generally know
that there is at least some small group that knows who they are. Households
provide these necessary support groups for the new folks...

I have seen a *lot* of new people come into the Society, having been in
charge of Carolingia's Demo Committee for two years, and having attended
around a dozen demos a year over the past five years. Very few of the people
who have become disenchanted with the Society have left because of politics.
*Many* have left because they didn't have a group to hang around with,
having fallen between the cracks. Most of the people who find the Society
to be their home first find a small subset of it that they call family,
and broaden from there.

One more point: Cher implies that joining a household early on will limit
one's activites and interests. I question this *very* strongly -- any
household that limits its members to specific interests has something
very wrong with it, and this is not at all common, in my experience...

It exists. It's called "Forward Into the Past", and is, indeed, available
from the Stock Clerk. As I recall, it costs $.60 per copy, and is copy-
permissible for SCA educational purposes. It's not a glossy magazine;
frankly, we don't go through *nearly* enough quantity to be able to afford
glossy color. But it *is* a very nice handout, giving a very basic idea
of what the Society is about in a few pages...

Greetings from William de Corbie!

Ariel of Caer Myrddin asks of us non-Americans:
>How much of your dealings are in a language other than English?  Have you
>developed "native" terms for any of the SCA-slang concepts we often use?
>I remember once seeing an introductory poster/flyer from Nordmark that was
>in Swedish and English.

Nordmark uses Swedish for everything except fighting commands like "lay on"
and "hold" (which we thought it better to keep international). We also use
a lot of English titles, like "Sir" and "Milord" because there are no good
Swedish equivalents. Most terms for SCA officers and groups have been
translated. 

Some examples: (oe = o with umlaut, ae = a with umlaut)

East Kingdom = Oestra kungadoemet
Principality = Furstendoeme
The Barony of Nordmark = Baroniet Nordmark
The Shire of Orcburg = Orcburgs haerad
No established translation exists for "Canton"; some are called "skeppslag"
meaning literally "ship crew", an old Scandinavian territorial unit.
Seneschal = drots
Herald = haerold
Chronicler = kroenikoer
Marshal = marsk
Chirurgeon = faeltskaer
M o/t Lists = tornejklerk
M o Arts/Sciences has not been translated, no good equivalent exists.

If we expect English-speakers to attend an event, information leaflets
will be done in both languages. When there are foreign guests present,
heralds will do almost everything in English at tournaments, somewhat
less at courts and revels. An interpreter is usually assigned to the
visiting foreigners, especially if there is some theatrical activity
that needs translation. Communication between individuals is usually no
problem since everybody speaks English.

I don't think there are many translations of the SCA slang words. We tend

fighting and armor, such as "wraparound", "Paul de Bellatrix snap",
"greaves" and "rhinohiding".

I hope this answers your question.

Subject: blackmail origins

Greetings, gentles of the Rialto,
In a recent note the origins of the term 'Black mail' was mentioned. I've
just checked in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, and it says:
    (1552)
    A tribute formerly exacted from small owners in the border districts of
    England and Scotland, by freebooting chiefs, in return for immunity
    from plunder.

It also gives a definition of 'Mail' which applies:
    Now only scottish, northern representation of Old Norse 'mal'(...)
    corresponds rather to ON. 'mali'- stipulation, stipulated pay(...)
    Payment, tax, tribute, rent.


The word 'blackguard' was around at the same time (1532), but its original
meaning and applications are unknown. It's tempting to tie them together
though.

Hoping to further the discussion...

Subject: Call for Satire

Greetings all from Lady Ellisif Flakkingskvinne, East Kingdom Chronicler.

The East Kingdom is very large and very active.  This causes some problems
for my office, because we don't have enough money to print issues large 
enough to really cover everything that's going on.  So, I'm planning a little
fundraiser, and I thought some Rialtans might be interested in helping.

We're going to publish an isssue of _Not Necessarily the Pikestaff_ and sell
it at Pennsic.  The object is humor, and I hope that this will be a great
success.

If you think you might be interested in writing for this, please let me know!
Artists are needed, too!  Nothing is sacred; no idea is too bizarre to be
considered.  I am looking for event announcements, letters from officers,
odd articles, ads, calendar entries, ideas for ways we can "tamper with" the 
usual items like the calendar, regnum, etc., and any other ideas you have.
Even if you don't have time to write or draw it yourself, if you have an idea,
please let me know.  And please help spread the word to others who might be
interested.

This issue will go to the printer in mid-July, so I will need materials by
approximately July 6 (later if electronic).

Also, if you are willing to donate Pennsic merchanting time or space, or 
money, to this project, please let me know.

Thanks all for your time!  Write for more information!

Subject: An unusual request

A co-worker of mine recently attended an "Paper Collectibles" show in
Allentown, PA, and purchased an ALMOST entire page of original artwork for a
Prince Valiant strip.  *ONE* panel of the entire page was bought (earlier that
morning) and he is trying to locate the panel, and the person who bought it. 
As he has, for the most part, eliminated other "collectors" from his search (as
a collector of such things would have bought the entire thing, as he did), we
suspect that it might be a someone interested merely in what the panel
depicted, which is a scene inside the castle (the ONLY panel in the strip
showing the inside of the castle), showing Val, Aleta, three children and the
King; and a "throne" with carving on it... the "missing" panel is 16"x11" or
so, and is probably the best piece of Prince Valiant art I've ever seen (we've
got a mostly complete photocopy of the panel). 

If anyone has any leads, please let me know!

At the end of a recent note, Duke Vissevald says:

     Anyway, all this leads me to conclude I don't have the foggiest
     notion of whether the wrap blow was a medieval technique against
     a steel-helmeted person or not.

We've all seen dozens of the miniatures from medieval bibles and manuscripts
that show knights hacking each other's helmets down to the eyeslots.  I realize
that it would be difficult for an artist to represent a wrap blow, but has
anyone seen any paintings that look like a wrap is being thrown?  While this
won't necessarily settle the "was the wrap a period technique ?" question,
a period representation of one being thrown will certainly help the discussion.

   References, anyone?

Yes, this is exactly the story Stasheff told when I saw him

and years later heard of the SCA.  I'm reasonably sure the first

Claim it as an irreplaceable art object and refuse to let it out of your hands.
There is a gentleman in the SCA who transports his crossbow this way.  On the
other hand, his bow is a period reporduction beautifully engraved with dragosn,
so "irreplaceable art object" is convincincing when coming from him.

To transport arrows is very simple: Put them in a box.   First obtain two
peices of styrfoam that fit the ends of the box.  Piece them with holes and
slide the arrows in.  Styrofoam is sticky, the arrows will stay put.  In this
way the arrows are supported at each end and kept from jostling one another,
regardless of what position the box finds itself in.  Make sure its a sturdy
box and you will have no trouble.  This is how my mail order quarrels and
arrows are delivered to me.  After several dozen arrows, none have been
damaged.  

To pack a bow is considerably more expensive if you can't get it by the
security guards.  For a five ft bow you will have to build or pay a shipping
company to build a box to fit.  This box should be fitted with internal
cardboard or styrofoam supports to keep the bow from sliding around inside.
Again, this is the way my crossbow was delivered to me, and it survived without
problem.  Do dismantle anything that might cause odd shapes, my stirrup was
disconnected from the crossbow and nailed down with duct tape.

Subject: hot pink

Hot pink is one of those things that is universally cited as being non-period,
but I wonder about it.  Lady Muriel Chanteuse, a weaver, did some research, and
informed me that she had discovered some rather shocking shades of pink were
used in period.  I wonder if anybody else has seen these sources, or did she
perhaps err?  I know there were some bright pink inks, but that is not the same
as fabric dyes.  The Orientals used some extraordinarily bright pink, orange,and 
red dyes (the term "flourescent" comes to mind.  Anybody who thinks the
Japanese are the epitome of conservative taste doesn't know what he's talking
about.) but I don't know when these dyes were developed.

But if you want truly tacky costumes, I still think Heinrich's honky toy is the most
amusing worst taste I've come across.  Heinrich is Landesknecht with
unrepentant yellow and red puff and slash finery.  He has a large and prominent
codpiece, and in this codpiece is..... gack, gasp, gowk, a squeeky toy.  Not
that I have ever gotten close enough to discover this for myself, mind you, I
didn't have to.  Heinrich will walk around holding his codpiece and honking it
at people.   NOBODY can ignore a guy five foot tall, and four foot wide, clad
all in yellow and red satin puffery, honking his codpiece.  
Nor ever forget.  Alas, we have no costumers guild to save us from this
incredible monster...it was the costumers guild that made it for him!

Subject: date rape

Since SCA seems to result in a lot of interpersonal intimacy, it would be
useful for the membership to discuss this date rape.  Their is a lot of
confusion about just what constitutes rape, with the majority of people
thinking rape is sex with violence, or threat of violence.  In truth, there are
many other subtle ways in which a person can be obliges to violate their wishes
and cooperate in something they do not wish to do that does them no physical
injury other than the act of sex.  I have seen some SCA folk enploy these
techniques to pressure a partner into cooperating with them, and they seem to
feel that they did nothing wrong, because after all, the lady could have said
no. The problem is, they don't realize (or refuse to admit) is because they mad
ethe price of saying no higher than the price of submitting to the will of the
masher.  Getting a person so drunk they can't make a rational decision is date
rape.  Depriving a person of sleep until in exhaustion they say yes just to get
And refusing to leave when the lady hints its time to go is another.

My husband was quite shocked (and very quiet) when four women he knew were
having a frank discussion about date rape.  Each of us had been victimized 
in this way.  There are ways to avoid non-violent rape, alas, at the tiem we
were assaulted we did not know how to cope with such rogues.  Older and wiser,
such nefarious techniques no longer work on us.  But they still work on other
niave, lonely, or timid women.  Granted, a woman ought to be knowledgeable
enough and persistant enough and tough enough to deal with such cads.  Such
skill and fortitude comes through experience, unpleasant experience.  And while
women ought to be equipped with the abilities they need to outwit date rape,
they still ought not be subjected to such behaviour in the place.

Subject: Diversity again

Greetings from William de Corbie!

Mistress Arastorm tells of humorous silliness from spectators at SCA
tournaments. I have seen many similar things here in Nordmark. One time
they had a court magician. Whenever someone was killed, he danced around
the body singing "magick wordes" and thus brought the slain man back to
life (or animated the body so that it could walk off the field, whatever).

As to comments from the sides, I also have a video tape from a tourney in
Drachenwald. In one bout Duke Paul de Bellatrix is facing four opponents
simultaneously. The marshal yells "Lay on!" About five seconds later, a
voice can be heard from behind the camera: "Is it over yet?"

(It actually took the Duke almost 60 seconds to kill all four.)

This is where we are all divided. There are many of us who would like to
see less diversity in the SCA. Personally, I would prefer an SCA that was
limited to Western Europe AD 1000-1400, because that is what I regard as
the true Middle Ages -- the historic and cultural era most easily associated
with knights & ladies, courtly love, tournaments, chivalry, and feudalism.
Which is what I feel the SCA *should* be about.

It might have been different if sterner measures had been taken to control
personas in the beginning of our history. But here we are, after 25 years
of slow evolution. The SCA has become an extremely diverse group, and the
only way we can possibly counteract this is by encouraging newbies to
adopt the type of personas we think are appropriate. It is useless to
ask for rules that would ban samurai, barbarians, American indians or
anything else we would not want to see in a perfect Camelot. They are
here, and we just have to live with it.

There was an extensive discussion about this on the Rialto some time ago,
and the conclusion we reached was that it is better to live and let live
than fight about who belongs and who doesn't. Telling a "barbarian" that
he must change his persona will be interpreted as a violation of his/her
right to do what the h**k he/she likes - that most sacred of Human Rights
in America. I know and admire several excellent gentles whose personas I
think do not belong in the SCA. Sadly, any attempt to question their
personas will be misunderstood as an attack in the person(s) themselves
and as an attempt to drive them out of the Society.

The SCA attracts a lot of people who aren't really very interested in the
western European high middle ages. Our fighting attracts martial artists,
who are generally Japanese-oriented and want to play samurai. Also
attracted are people whose principal interest may be music, or revelry,
or fantasy literature, or dating. The Society has chosen to let all these
people do their thing. As I said, I would personally have preferred a
somewhat less diverse and more authentic "theatrical" setting for our
events -- but I accept that I cannot have everything the way I want it.
Even with all the "bad" personas, this is still a great group!

But of course, let us guard those limits that we still *have* -- no
elves, deities, cowboys or cartoon ducks!

There are no Markland groups that far south. Please do not  think us worhty of

Subject: Society Women Warriors

Greetings unto the Rialto:

         The recent discussion of historical women warriors has left me curious
as to the number of women in the Society who have achieved honor as fighters
(i.e. knights, masters, royalty by their own hands, kingdom fighting awards,
etc.).
         I am a firm believer that these Current Middle Ages are as "they
should have been," and am interested in promoting fighting for women in my
area.  I would like to be better informed about those ladies who have served
their kingdoms well by taking up of arms.  Thank you in advance.
                                        
                                          In sercive to the Society,

I would tend to agree with the folks who say that the Pennsic War is one of the
 safest places for a young lady to be in this day and age. You are surrounded
by thousands of folks who are dedicated to Chivalry. All of them are armed, and
a majority have martial arts training (rattan, fencing, or mundane). Three or
four Pennsics ago, I was sitting at a fire with a group of friends when a young
lady at the neighboring camp decided it would be amusing to begin screaming at
the top of her lungs (the only thing her group was doing at the time was
telling jokes and drinking excessively). I was instantly on my feet, over the
two fences between our camps, ready to let whomever was abusing this lady try
to abuse me. I reached the fire, and realized that the lady was in no danger
 and was merely being drunk and silly. As I began to give her a *very* stern
lecture, I noticed at least twenty other people standing around the edges of
her camp, some with drawn swords. This was within ten seconds of her scream.
Try getting that kind of response to a call for help in Mundania.

Subject: Authenticity vs fun

Unto the lords and ladies of the Rialto does Taran send greetings.

I have followed the occasional flurries of comments from the 'authenticity
mavens' and the 'fun mavens' with varying degrees of interest, knowing those
from both sides of the debate, and feeling that it was no bad thing to have
both, since having both contributed to the full experience that is what I enjoy
so much about the SCA, and since neither side seemed to have power over the
other.  I have friends in both camps, and the SCA as a whole was fun.

But something happened recently at an event that at the least increased my
cynicism of the SCA, and perhaps to some extent soured me on the group.  Let
me state that I have recently started, with great trepidation, to fulfill a
minor dream of mine of really learning to play my recorder.  I am no great
shakes as a musician, have little or no training, but I *had* started to play
with the local jongleurs, and in spite of the frustration attendant on my bad
playing, and my fear of making a fool of myself, it was fun.  I had learned a
coupl of pieces well enough to play for dancing, and it was FUN.

I had convinced myself (let the Guildmistress convince me) to play in the
dance set.  Most of the pieces I knew I wouldn't really play, but there was one
that I could play as well as most, and better then some.

Then as I stood there, convincing myself again that I wasn't a fool, the
dancemistress came over and told the guildmistress that we weren't going to
play my favorite piece.  The only one I *knew* I could play.  And why, you ask?
Her exact words were: "Yes, I know the jongleurs like to play it, and the
people like to dance it, but it isn't real!."  That did it, I left, and who
knows if I'll be back.

What is my point here?  It's a long, rambling story, but the point is that one
person, being an 'authenticity maven' gained enough power to deprive two groups
of people of something that they both enjoyed, and incidentally caused me to
not try a new experince.

I have intentionally mentioned no name, though some will undoubtedly guess. I
do ask that all SCA folk of whatever camps think about this type of happening
before they embark on they're particular 'authenticity' or 'fun' crusades.  A
little feel for what the various folk really want and the personal restraint
to allow their needs to overcome your personal glory is NO BAD THING!

the name of a market district in Venice, and is a place where many

Greetings!

I have been procrastinating about commenting on some of the more recent
topics, because (among other reasons) I have been finding it difficult to
articulate my thoughts.  However, the impending extended downtime for this 
system has pushed me to resort to an old maxim of mine which I normally avoid 
on this forum at all costs:  spit it out, and clean it up later.  :-)

Regarding Countess Arastorm's posting about the wonderfulness of household 
"sucking up" newcomers:  sorry, but I simply cannot agree.  First of all, 
I think people should be given the opportunity to become encultured in the 
Society, finding their own interests and such first.  I have always intensely 
disliked the idea of putting a new person in an "instant niche."

There are other reasons I dislike this practice.  Too often, in too many
places (for whatever reasons), households are synonomous with factions.  A 
newcomer joining a household will unfortunately be subjected to guilt by 
association in such an instance, quite possibly to their detriment later.

Then there's the possiblility that the newcomer will later discover, as their 
own interests develop, that they have nothing truly in common with the rest of 
the household.

And so on, and so forth.  I won't go on at length, but additional reasons 
abound.

But what I consider to be the worst aspect is not this phenomenon of 
households grabbing newcomers in itself, but rather the larger and more
serious problem it helps to define:  the failure on the part of many (*too* 
many) groups to take care of, and enculture, newcomers.  It is the 
responsiblity of the group as a whole to do this.  Not only do many groups not 
do so, a large number of older groups just don't care to; they simply don't 
care to take the time or trouble.

The SCA is growing at an exponential rate, and has been for some time.  This 
is a problem which cannot go too long unsolved in too many places, or those 
aspects of Society life which all of us so treasure may come to be irreparably 
damaged.

Regarding personae:  in teaching newcomers (which I do a lot), I try to pass 
on the same attitude which I myself found in An Crosaire, and which seems to 
serve well.  To wit:  a persona is a means to an end, not the end in itself.  
Sometimes people lose sight of this, becoming too caught up in the persona 
itself.  I teach that one's persona can be whatever one wishes to make of it,
and it will probably serve one best and most importantly as a vehicle.  A
vehicle for taking part in Society activities, and for focusing and pursuing
one's individual interests.  In welcoming newcomers to the Barony of An
Crosaire, we urge them to cast about for a while, and talk to others, before
choosing a name and attempting to create a persona.  It has been our
experience that if one changes one's mind later, the original name still tends
to stick. 

Finally, regarding garish clothing:  be careful, some of this sort of stuff 
can sneak up on you and turn out to be period!  :-)  Not that this is in any 
way my area of expertise, but what the hey...

Let me tell a story by way of explanation, which Baron Seamus can confirm if 
he wishes upon his return home (funnily enough, he's *here* visiting right 
now!):   Seamus has a Japanese persona, Jutte, who is nearly as well-known as 
Seamus.  Once upon a time in Meridies, then-King Orlando Cavalcanti presented 
Jutte-sama with what was meant to be a gag gift:   a plaid kimono.  And (of 
course) not just *any* plaid; no, no, no-- _this_ plaid featured such lovely 
colors as bright pink and watermelon green!  Definitely on the, um, noticeable 
side...

Well, Jutte being the kinda guy he is, he goes away and does some research.  
Turns out this crazy plaid is honest-to-God period for Japanese!  Seems the 
plaid was adopted from Europeans in imitation of them, much as Samurai also 
did things like wear lace collars with their armor.  And Japanese dyers of the 
period could produce a lot of these bright colors.  In fact, fabrics of the 
period in such patterns and colors are apparently still extant, and photos are 
readily available in books.

So of course some the European types then did research, with some 
occassionally surprising results.  Most of which I don't remember, and 
wouldn't waste more bandwidth iterating, probably.

But the point remains the same:  check it out; you might just be surprised!!

Greetings, all, from Ariel.

Hi Gavin!  Welcome to the Rialto!

To Colin Mackay of Balmaghie: Please let me know if you've received the 
mead recipe I sent you.  The address you gave me keeps bouncing back.  At 
worst, I'll print it and snail-mail it to you.  (BTW, Hal, by the time you 
read this a copy should be in your inbox!)

On how knights and such made their livelihood: Remember the parts in "The 
Three Musketeers" when the Musketeers were out of money, and the various 
creative ways they used to obtain more?

Here's a question for those of you who are in the SCA outside of the US: 
How much of your dealings are in a language other than English?  Have you 
developed "native" terms for any of the SCA-slang concepts we often use?  
(For example, the SCAdians in Quebec use "mondaines" for "mundanes", and 
"SCA" is "ASCAC".)  I remember once seeing an introductory poster/flyer 
from Nordmark that was in Swedish and English.  (I'm just curious; this 
grew out of an offline discussion about the "cultures" of different 
Kingdoms.)

Subject: Glovemaking

Greetings to the Rialto, and esp. Elizabeth of Braidwood:

I have been experimenting with glovemaking, and have come up with a
few reference books you may find useful:

Collins, C. Cody.  Love of a Glove. New York, Fairchild Publishing, 1949.
  (has a simple history of gloves, some photos of period gloves from 1500
   on, and some quickie hints on leatherworking for gloves)
Cummings, Valerie.  Gloves.  London, Batsford. 1982.  (Good historical
  info, but starts at 1600.  Does very briefly cover Elizabethan gloves,
  and has reproduction of mid-17th-century patterns for gloves)
Johnson.  Leatherwork.  London, C.A. Pearson, 1949.  (Leatherworking
  how-to with instructions for making both lined and unlined leather gloves.
  The patterns given are not too far off from the ones in Cummings)
Smith, F.R.  Practical Leatherwork.  New York, Pitman. 1946.  (Dover took
  over this one, but I don't know if it's being published anymore.  Like
  Johnson, a modern book but with adaptable patterns and helpful how-tos
  on construction).

There are also extant period gloves to be found in books on period
embroidery and costume accessories.  There are knitted gloves in pictures
and references, knitters on the Net may know of some.

It seems the major trick in making gloves is not the sewing or decorating,
but the fitting - make patterns on scrap leather or interfacing, and test-
fit before cutting the good leather.  I've made 2 pair so far - one of
heavy suede lined with rabbit fur (I'm tired of freezing fingers at the
Winter Revel), and a pair of lighter "suede" gloves with embroidered
gauntlet cuffs (in exchange for a new gambeson), and the fit is the most
difficult thing to work out.  However, once the pattern is set, you're
fine.  I've yet to use a purchased pattern - I'm heading to the library
to trace down that address mentioned yesterday on the net!

Hopefully this information will be helpful.  Next project - gloves for
archery before the Pennsic!

Subject: Royal Majesty / honor

<exasperation on>

As an example of a common usage, I quote:

> at the behest of His Royal Majesty, King ...
                       ^^^^^ ^^^^^^^

I have seen the noted usage many times: in the Pale, in speech, et
cetera (so I'm not picking on milady Cher).  Is there any rational
explanation for it?

In styles, pray tell, what OTHER form of Majesty can there be?  Can
there be "Her Royal Excellency"?  "His Baronial Majesty"?  (Other than
Carolingia, of course.)  I would point out that the correlation of
royalty with "Majesty" is not less than 100%.  Do we use "Her
Excellent Excellency"?  Is this usage not "His Redundant Redundancy"?

Also, what is this blather about "Majesty"?  Perhaps I am mistaken
about titles and such; if so, correct and forgive me.  As I recall,
the style of "Majesty" was reserved for the Emperor/Empress until the
Renaissance, in England at least.  (Its adoption by the English Kings
was part of the break with Rome, as was the use of the closed crown,
another symbol of empire.  A separate imperial power surely has an
independent patriarchate.)

Speaking as a 1100's Englishman, I condemn the usage as presumptuous,
for even a king may reach too high.  Every man and woman has a place
and a rank in life, and is entitled to the respect attendant, no less
and NO MORE.  A king, however exalted, is a "mere" king, not a Emperor
of Rome.

Were I to interact with a royal person, I would be most tempted to use
the style "Grace" or "Highness".  In reality, of course, I would
probably lack the courage to do so or the patience to explain my
words, and would walk away cursing myself for a coward.

<exasperation off>

Actually, what *should* one do in such a circumstance?  What should an
Icelander do if he would be required to swear fealty to the Crown and
not to a person?  (Answer: like Myrkfaellin, swear to the person in
Icelandic, so nobody knows that you didn't swear as expected.)  What
should I do, if I am universally expected to do something contrary to
my persona's conscience?

the fiber arts, as it regularly covers spinning, dyeing, crocheting, knitting, 
sewing, weaving, and just about every aspect.  even the clothing articles, 
while not costume- or garb-oriented, are interesting for details of garment 
construction that can be applied to other projects.  these are also the same 
publishers that have bought out folkwear and are bringing out those patterns 
again (one hopes with better instructions).  if you can't acquire a back issue,

I think the SCA, Inc. should put together a professional-looking,
four color, glossy brochure, describing the SCA, etc.  This would
be available, in bulk, from the Stock Clerk, so groups could order
large quantities to distribute at demos and events.

Most groups produce their own flyers, and I have seen some
that were well written and others that were rather poorly done.
Few groups have the resources, however, to produce a high-quality
brochure.

It is true that the SCA varies from place to place, but it is possible
to write a good, general introduction to the SCA, such as that
recently posted by Arval Benicoeur, written by Siobhan Medhbh O'Roarke.
Add some color pictures of fancy garb, pavillions, fighting, etc.,
and the result could be an enticing glimpse into another world,
something that a passer-by can take home to remind him or her of
the strange sights seen that day.

A slip-shod photocopy of something off a dot-matrix printer would

My lord, one would need more background knowledge to make a better judgement,
but this description suggests a possible motivation with which I'm in sympathy.

The dancemistress's choice of words was unfelicitous -- "not real", indeed! --
but the meaning might well have been (often is)  "I know many people enjoy
this twentieth-century dance, but I'm trying to limit its appearances.  When
we started doing it, it was a pleasant novelty, but now, two years later, 
less than one third of the dances we do are strictly 'period'.  And most of
our newer members have never learned to do those properly."

This is fairly wide-spread, and it is not at all the same as "I don't care
if it's fun; it's not period so you can't have it."

It's a pity that this axe fell just as you were about to perform.  I urge you
to try again, with this dance or with others.  It's fun, and I guarantee that 
you will not make a fool of yourself.

-----

haste+@andrew.cmu.edu 

      And there is more to it than this, for dancing is practised to 
reveal whether lovers are in good health and sound of limb, and
after which they are permitted to kiss their mistresses in order that 
they may touch and savour one another, thus to ascertain if they
are shapely or emit an unpleasant odour as of bad meat.  Therefore,
from this standpoint, quite apart from the many other advantages to
be derived from dancing, it becomes an essential in a well-ordered
society. -- Thoinot Arbeau (1588)

The Calafian Brewers' Guild has the opposite problem: they
come up with a new (and usually delicious!) drink every few months,
so it becomes expected of them.  Only once in a great while does
one recipe stand out to the point of becoming traditional (the
current example being Dietrich's Golden Weave, which is described
as "molten Haagen-Dazs with a kick like a mule").

Similarly, our Cooks' Guild puts on major feasts only once or twice a
year, so at those feasts they produce literally dozens of different
dishes, most of which have never been served at feast before.

Subject: The care and feeding of newcomers:  How?

There has been some discussion--and I've gotten more mail than usual--on
the subject of those recently arrived in the SCA.  To start finding out
what others are doing (this is a hint, folks--What *are* you doing?),
I'll start with what goes on around here that I know of.

The Kingdom Chatellaine ahs a goodly supply of clothing that can be 
loaned out at events.  (At Beltane, this amounted to some 60 outfits
on Saturday alone.)  I believe she also carries at least some introductory
literature.

The Seneschal of the Province of the Mists goes to the local fighter
practice (the frequently mentioned BART Practice) on Thursdays, with
literature and a photo album organized by type of activity (rather than
by event).  This has been invaluable in talking with the stray
passers-by.  I also tend to suggest that BART practice is a good place
for newcomers to come to in order to meet people--though not to get
a real flavor of the SCA.

The College of St. Katherine (UC Berkeley) hold regular meetings during
the school year.  The also have a regular dance class (taught by 
Duke Frederick of Holland).  Since a fairly large portion of this group
is going to be new every year (or even, each semester), I think these
meetings qualify as "for newcomers"--at least in part.

These are the only activities that can be at all *formally* construed
as dealing with newcomers around--at least that come to my mind.  Other
activities are around in various stages of development or wishful thinking.

What is being done in *your* group?  (I.e. What ideas are there out in
the SCA that are worth stealing?)  How do you bring new people up to speed?
How do you *identify* those that are new and need help?  How do you let
them know that help getting their bearings is available, and from who?

The Baron of Calafia has a special household, called the Baronial
Household. All newcommers to the Barony are invited to join it, and
most people remain members for about 6 months. The Baronial Household
provides normal household support, such as people to camp with at wars.
There is also a meeting one evening each month at which various members of
the barony give talks. The current head of the Baronial Household (Mentor
of the Menage, abreviated to MOM) is the Baroness of Calafia. While
people are in the Baronial Household the MOM and other members of the
barony have an opportunity to find out what the newcommers are interested
in, and make sure they meet people who can help them.

Twice a year "graduates" of the baronial household are called forward in
a baronial court at an event, formally presented to the Baron and Baroness
and to the people of the barony, and given a medallion. 

I think this is a good compromise between leaving newcommers to sink or swim
on their own and having them pick a permanent household before they have
much idea what the various households are about and what they want to do in
the society.

Subject: Safety

Greetings to all who may come to read this from Colin Mackay of Balmaghie. All
the talk about safety in camps and the chivalry of our group leads me to
remember this incident; A number of years ago here in Lions Gate I was
autcratting some Highland Games at one of our favourite sites , the night was
growing late everybody who was to camp for the weekend was there, some had gone
to bed and a very colourfull Irishman had apparantely passed out drunk and had
been put to bed, the fire was dieing down when a gentle came out of his
pavilllion where he had been settling down his three smalls for the night and
asked if any one else heard some screaming.  Indeed we did, I had heard it off
and on for a while but had put it down to a nearby party. 4 of us went out to
th road about 2 minutes felt longer and had a look. Looking out we could see
some teens on the road and they seemed at first to be playing on the road, but
then another car passed them and one of them let out a cry of desperation/
terror, I called out to see if they needed any help. They sure did they had
come down a long straight road and turned too quickly onto another, hit some
gravel and the car landed upside down in a ditch.  One of the 4 of us turned
out to be a youth crises worker and he was very handy in helping a young female
who was going into shock.  The second person roared back to the camp to get
some help while 2 of us stood on the road and flagged down the next car to
summon help.  A cellular phone was also used to summon aid.  THe campsite on
hearing the call for MEDIC LIGHTS BLANKETS etc immeadiately came to lifew and
was out to the raod in seconds flat!!THis included the Irishman, suddenly sober
as a judge and dressed only in a little green kilt with a blue ribbon down the
front- he turned out to be a first aid instructor who was used to giving his
students this sort of a drill late at night, this was real and he was on top of
the situation, When the ambulane and trthe police arrived they could not
believe all (20 -30) these people out to help out, especially the Paramedic who
heard very professional diagnosis from the Kilted wonder and was dumbstruck for
a couple of seconds when asked if he was ready to take over. THe Police had to
know if this was all a Bunch of Robin Hoods or what!!!
Sorry to use so much bandswidth but the story is indicative of the couretesy
and chivalry which we all take for granted and is so sadly lacking in the
mundane world.

Gavin Kilkenny to Halfdanr Greetings;

  Please remember stickjock, swordjock, and rhinohide are all derogatory 
terms. As a dreadnought class fighter (Duke Sir), I resent the suggestion that 
I'm not anything but a dumb sting swinger. As to rhinos, I recommend being more 
cautiuos about calling people liars.
   You also raise an ancient fallacy about wrap blows not being effective 
in reality. All I can say is that my steel sword weighs more than my sticks, 
and has a much smaller impact area, not to mention less give. Since I can, and 
have, dented 14 ga. with the sticks, it seems pretty obvious that the same 
technique with a better weapon will produce a greater result.
   As for what to call someone with a real acknowledgement problem, 
try Weeble. Everyone knows that "Weebles wobble but they won't fall down." It's 
awfully hard to be macho about being a Weeble.

Words well spoken my lord. I have never (in my whole * 8 * months experience)
been denied a fight based on my gender but the following was a humorous conversation that took place between a bunch of fighters.
At Ursalmas Tourney in the Shire of Aqua Terra there stood a group of unbelted 
fighters awaiting a talk on chivalry. As another fighter tries to get past me
he gently puts his hands on my (armored) shoulders and says:

Unknown Fighter: Excuse me my lady may I.....

Lady's Friend:	 She's not a lady.....

Lady in Question: (Grabbing her friend) I *am* a lady and if you choose to 
forget this point again I will gladly meet you on the eric to prove it.

Innocent Bystander: She's not a lady, she's a body of armour, I don't hit lords
or ladies, I only hit armor.

At this point several others offer their tuppence worth as the lady's friend 
tries to get a word in. Being a Herald, he manages to make himself heard.

Lady's Friend: What I started to say is, She's not a lady, she's a lady         
*fighter*.

There is laughter and general agreement, and hugs exchanged between lady and
friend.
I fear this may be one of those situations where you needed to be there to catch the true humour. 8-)

With thanks to all the Lords and Ladies who have helped me to this point,
I remain in service to all,

A question was asked about a sulphurous smell emanating from a batch of
mead in the making -

While I have never made mead, I recently made a batch of beer with a good
deal of honey in the wort, and it smelled strongly of brimstone during
the fermentation, but tatsed rather well once finished.  Well, it didn't
taste of sulphur, anyway.  I would surmise the same for the mead.

Don't forget that there is an air of practicality about this as well...
YOU might be the loser next time.  It, therefore, behooves you to set
a reasonable price on the ransom in order to ensure that a reasonable price
is offered to you if you should lose...

Subject: re: little kids (under 5) at SCA events

Greetings to the parents of kids under 5 from Lady Orianna, the mother of
an (almost) 3 year old!

I have always had this problem too.  Kids activities at SCA events are
usually geared for children age 5 or 8 and up (and yet many also miss that
gap between 12 and 15 too).  These things involve learning heraldry and
such.  Rarely do you find activities for the under 5 crowd.

We have tried to have some activities at a couple of events for the under 5
crowd.  These included: a play area separated from the major adult area by
benches so the children could play but still be close to the main activity.
The play area had age appropriate toys (in a gym we used balls that the
kids could chase), crafts (coloring pens or crayons, paper, etc.), a snack
time, story telling, and a planned nap time for anyone wishing it where the
kids would take a collective nap or quiet time out with supervision by an
adult and parents were free to enjoy the event.  Since the weather was a
little bad, we didn't do some of the outdoor activites that we had planned,
like a nature walk for the older kids and general "run around and play" for
the younger.

Our solution to having our daughter along consisted of the following:
We selected which events we took her to and which she stayed with Grandma
(luckily, her "Oma" is close and will babysit).  We made sure that if the
event was too big (Ice Dragon), not guaranteed to have space for kids to
run and play in (Ice Dragon), was a heavy work event for one of us
(Investitures and Coronet Tournaments where we would both be busy heralding
or setting up court all day, or events that we were autocratting and
required a lot of attention), or we were ready for a break, she did not go.
 
Other events are ideal to take her to.  Myrkfaelinn's annual camping event
has lots of open space for her to run in and doesn't require much effort on
our part to attend.

Our other coping strategy was a young lady who attended events with us.  If
Brigid was along, we paid Kilde's way as payment for her help with Brigid.
This was a shared activity, not a full-time babysitting arrangement.  At
camping events, we would take turns on who spent the evening in camp and
who went camp hopping.  At indoor events, Kilde would help out if, for
example, we both had business in Court and Kilde would hold Brigid.   When
Kilde went to college, we got lost!  We had truely been spoiled.

Anyway, this is too long as is.  My  suggestions would be to a) find
someone to share the burden with, even if this means paying their way to
the event.  b) plan activities that you know your kids enjoy (reading
stories to them, playing with their favorite toys, coloring if they are old
enough).  c) find other parents with kids the same age.  Pool resources and
kids.  Let the kids play together while you get acquainted and swap "war"
stories.

Unfortunately, until the kids are old enough to be allowed on their own at
an event, you will probably spend a lot of time sitting on the sidelines.
Find some friends who are willing to sit with you to talk, so you at least
aren't isolated.

Best of luck!

Subject: weapons on planes

I MAIL myself the blade of a [mundane fencing] weapon.  $2.40 each way
does it, for up to two pounds [i think].  Just tell the hotel or
whatever what you're doing, so when this funny piece of metal shows up
they know what to do.

Arrows should be no harder.

The bow itself is longer than the [4 foot] limit [mundane fencing gear
just makes it at 110cm = 44 inches], but as has been pointed out they
don't get so ippity pippity about bows.  Allow two days, plus one day
per 700 miles, not counting Sundays.


Of course you need to be willing to part with the thing for a while
before and after the trip, and it has to be not worth insuring.

Subject: lavender surcotes

I wouldn't worry about.  There are lots of purple surcotes at Pennsic, most
worn by the fighters from Calontir, and a lot worn by some group of 
Easterners.  After a few wars these surcotes are lavender too.  Nobody is any
less impressed on account of it. 

And if you have the proper frmae of mind, it can even be an advantage.  I
remember one female fighter who wanted her feminity made obvious, even though
she was waering a breastplate. The armorer molded breasts into the plate.  As
long as she held her shield up, her breastplate was concealed.  And so she
would surprise unwary males by flashing them, and taking advantage of their
startlement to conk them on the head.

And I remember a bit of shtick engaged in by Duke Master Moonwulf, something
about catching a blow on his shield--which was a rather different
interpretation about just what those fighters are doing out there when they
chase each other around the list field. 

I'd say a sense of humour will make more difference than a lavender surcote
in the outcome of any combat.

Subject: warrior women

I haven't done in particular research on this subject, but their are some
examples of warrior women in period, especially early period. Buodicca, queen
of the Celts immeddiately comes to mind.  I have read, but do not know how
accurate it is that Celtic women would follow their men into battle.  Again,
we're talking Dark Ages. 

 The Laxdaela Saga, which I am currently reading, was
written about the year 1245, and it has a scene in which a vengeful divorced
wife dons breeches, rides astride a horse, and goes off to take revenge on her
ex husband.  She slashes him with a sword, permanently crippling his right
arm.  Folks on her side of the dispute thought she acted perfectly reasonable,
folks on his side thought it was unreasonable, and wanted to mount horse and
persue her and put her to death.  The saga in an earlier scene criticizes her
for wearing breeches, but seems to take the idea of her hacking away at her ex
husband as a perfectly reasonable undertaking for a woman.  

For Continental women, I've run across various accounts of women, who in the
absence of their male protector, dons armor and defend the castle.  These
ladies apparently did not actually fight, they, like the later 
Queen Elizabeth, donned armor as a sort of propaganda ploy to hearten the
troops; or to deceive the attackers into  beleiving that the lord had come
back.  Some of these women apparently coordinated the castle defense and as
such were the de facto commander of the castle, but knowing that you ought to
dump boiling oil on the guys with  the ladders is not the same a whacking
people with a sword.  

On the other hand, I have seen some small blades in museums which the museums
claim were used by women for self defense.  I don't remember in particular what
they looked like, but they were daggers,stilettos, and poinards,  one of which
 was fairly substantial in size, being approximately as big as a bowie knife.

On the other hand, I have seen a photograph of a suit of ring mail in the
Kremlin of Moscow's collection which I swear must be armor for a woman.  It has
an increase in the chest area that would not be needed by a male warrior, but
which would accomadate the breasts of a woman.  The helmet displayed with it is
a closed face helm, lacking even eyeslits.  The faceplate is piereced with a
multitude of holes (rather like a collander) for ventilation and vision.  It
would be utterly impossible to determine the gender of a person in this get up,
for the slight alteration in the mail is not noticeable unless you know how to
make mail and you look close.  The date is 16th century.  I have a vague memory
from East European history of some reference to Lithuanians of this period be
reviled by their neighbors for their pagan ways and unfeminine women.  Wonder
what the women were up to that so rated the ire of good Christians?  Going into
combat would certainly do it.

Subject: Scottish houses

I bought the June 1990 copy of Colonial Homes magazine because it has a photo
article enttiled "Scottish Colonists and the Architecture of Their Homeland".
Several of the houses pictured are period or near period.  Unfortunately, most
of the article dwells on out of period houses, but the period material shown is
interesting.  I wil describe some of the houses.

One ofhte pictures is of a so-called "black house" at the Highland Folk Museum
in Kingussie.  The exterior walls are light colored stone and the roof is
thatch, so I presuem "black" refers tothe darkness of the interior.  The house
is built of drystone walls with a grass growing in top of the walls.  Poles
like tent poles support the thatch roof.  The building is long and narrow.  The
short wall is blank.  The long wall has a door near one end, then two small
wiundows, one above the other, then three protrusions that from their placement
and shape I assume to be steps to the roof.  Another, larger (but not big)
window is near the other end.  There is no chimney, and the two walls shown in
the photo have neither smoke hole nor oven.  The caption says that such homes
were used from the 9 to 19th century by Highland farmers.  It also notes that
the floors were earth, and the roofs might be made of heather as well as
thatch.  a small building of the same constuction is nearby.  It's purpose is
not identified.  

Two photos show exteriors in the restored period village of Culross.  Houses
shown are 16th and 17th centuries.  One is a row house, the other is a tower
house.  Niether the photos nor the text offer very much information about them.

third floor gabled attic.  The roof is red pantiles.  A chimney is at one side.
The first  floor has a double door of solid wood and a double hung window with
 six quarrels over six quarrels.  The second story has two casement windows.
Each window is composed of two panesof glass.  The smaller window is composed
of two panes of glass, each pane is one quarrel wide and four quarrels tall.
The larger window is composed of two panes of glass, each two quarrels wide and
four quarrels tall, but the quarrels are larger than in the smaller window.
The quarrels are joined with wooden mullions. Each window is composed of
 quarrels different in size and shape than the other windows. No mass
production here. The door opens directly onto the cobblestone street.  The
floor is level with the street, with only a shallow threshold.
This house is some what lower than its neighbor by a few
inches, I imagine that in a hard rain water puddled from the street into the
house.

Of the tower house very little can be seen in the photo.  It is tall and
skinny, moreso than the rowhouse.  It has three stories, but the third story is
composed of two separate gables with windows.  Only four windows show in the
photo, and they are *very* small.  Each gable has a chimney protruding fromt eh
highest point of the roof.  It also has a red pantile roof, and whitewashed
walls.  

A more informative set of photos and text describe Gladstone's Land, built in
1600 and enlarged in 1617.  It has been restored to its 1617 exterior, and the
furnishings are mid 1600's.  "Land" is period language for tenement.
Gladstone's Land was inhabited by a propseprous cloth merchant who owned the
building.  He rented out four of the six floors to various middle class
tenants.  He and his family lived on the fourth floor. The buildign is made
of stone and timber.  teh sixth floor has two large dormers in a gable roof.
Teh first floor has an arcade with two arches.  A turnpike (spiral stair)
accesses upper stories.  Floors two through five have three large double hung
windows, not all of which have been completely restored.  Each floor has a
different window from the other floors.  Floors two and three have partially
restored windows.  All that is left is the upper sash, composed of quarrels
five tall and four wide.  Teh lower part of the windows are smaller, and filled
with solid wooden shutters.  The fourth floor has windows composed of six
quarrels over nine, and the fith floor has windows composed of nine quarrels
over  nine.  The attic has small windows composed of nine over six.  The
windows in the stairwell are small and inconsistant also, but the photops isn't
large enough for me to tell exactly what they are.  I find this use of various
sized windows to be curious.  After all, it would be faster to use one pattern
and make a bunch of the same thing.  The front was built all at once in 1617
when Thomas Gladstone expanded the building.  Other buildings beside it offer
no clues, as they have obviously modern windows.

The first floor had two arches to shelter shoppers while they shopped the two
shops.  Apparently business was  conducted by a customer standing at a counter
and telling the shopkeeper what they wanted, much as is done in fast food
restaurants today.  shoppers did not enter the shops.  In additon to the shops.
the cellar housed a tavern, and the upper floor had living quarters.

Originally the building was set back 23 feet from its current position. It had
wooden galleries running across its front.  When he bought it in 1617 Thomas
Gladstone removed the galleries and extended the building into the street.
This was a common practice, and the street became very narrow as a result. 

The interiors don't show anything that isn't already known to SCA folk, except
the Painted Chamber.  Stone walls and beamed ceilings were heavily painted in
the SCandinavian style, which was popular at the time.  The stair also shows
some curved timbers that were originally from a ship.  

Teh furniture is pretty standard, except for one curious item, a "going cart"
17th century term for a baby walker.  It looks pretty much like a modern
walker, but is made of carved and turned wood and has no seat.  It is a frame
that a baby stood in the middle of and held onto to keep from falling down
while practicing walking.   This startled me,a s I thought such thigns were a
modern invention.  What other kinds of baby equipment date back this far, and
how early were they invented?  The device is pretty simple, just a wooden frame
on wheels, it would have easily been within the capacity of any medeival
carpenter to make one, if he thought of it.I suppose a prerequisite would be a
building with a smooth floor, or the thing wouldn't roll, so that would let out
the more primitive homes in period.

That pretty much exhausts the period information, but an 18th century house has
a photo of an intriguing kitchen device.  A fan is mounted in the chimney and
is connected to the spit by a set of pulleys.  Rising heat from the fire turns
the fan, which turns the spit.  The hotter the fire, the faster the spit turns.
I know that all mannner of gadgets were invented in the Rennaissance, so
probably somethign like this existed in period.  And having seen Scadians
slaving over a spit all day to cook a side of beef or a pig, it ocurrs to me
that this shouldn't be too difficult to figure out and build, not to mention
useful. I will try to describe it as best I can, maybe a blacksmith will want
to give it a try.


The fireplace is very large, almost head high,a nd filled with a grill, hanging
kettles and whatnot.  Above the fireplace, set into the wall is a metal black
that isn't shown well enough to describe.  Their is a circle in it that is
apparently a gear.  This meshes iwth what is defintely a gear.  An axle runs
through the middle of the gear and through the middle of a double pulley ont eh
other end.  Teh ends of the axle are supported by things that look like small
brass lamps.  Teh lamps have long tails that lead down to a bar and braces that
support them.  They in turn support the axle.  Each pulley has a brass chain
that connects to a pulley on a spit.  Their are two spits, one large in
diameter and flat, with a set of prongs to hold a large piece of meat, probably
somethign as big as a whole pig or calf.  It is the bottom spit.  The upper
spit is also flat where the meat fits on (but round where it enters the
supports ) Three prongs, which must be removable, are on it.  These prongs are
holding three chickens.  The spits are not in the fireplace, but right in front
of it.  The heat is supplied by a grate full of coal or charcoal.  The grate is
elevated so that the surface of the grate is at waist height--no bending over
to work in this fireplace.  The surface of the grate is not very clear, I can't
tell whether its a grill, open, or flat, or what.  Kettles are hanging over it.
One hanging item is a flat plate with something cooking on it that looks like a
pizza shell , except that its composed of wedges instead of one circle.
Miscellaneous tools and appliances I dont' recognize surround the fireplace.
The baking oven is a couple feet away and I think it has its own coalbox for
heat.  

This fireplace is defintely more sophisticated than a bar b que grill that so
many Americans have, and would be a lot easier to cook on.  It wouldn't be such
a bad thing to prepare a feast on it.  After, all, if people are crazy enough
to cook feasts over campfires and in bar b que pits, this ought to be a step
up.  Our group built a bar b que pit for a campground as part of the barter to
use it for an event, how much better for every body if we'd only known a little
more, done a little more work, and made such a fireplace.  We had to hire a
butcher-cook to tend the meat all day, while we did everything else. Nobody
wants to spend hours turning meat, and large pieces of meat that won't fit a
modern oven have to be done this way.  Time for us to learn what our ancestors
already knew.

        I suppose I should have been a little more specific...*sigh*... 
        we kept ours under * close * personal supervision until they were 
        about 8 years old....we then let them play on their own, WITHIN
        OUR SIGHT, or WITH THE OTHER KIDS under the supervision of an
        older child who had the specific duty of "taking care of the babies,"
        and who had proved themselves competent to do so....the kids had
        regular check-in times, as a group, and operated under strict rules
        of behaviour. They took pride in "acting like the grown-ups," with
        their own boffer tourneys, scavenger hunts and such-like, and, as
        soon as they were mature enough, they began participating in the
        main activities of the group, being Pages and Squires, and Apprentices
        and Proteges, and Autocrat's Runners, and Herald's Helpers &c.
        Once we got the Barony of SunDragon going, this became easier,
        as we had quite a lot of families with children of varying ages in
        the group...watching the pack of them having a joyous time is most
        pleasant indeed.....and watching the 14-17 year olds "cruising"
        Merchant's Row last Estrella was * great * entertainment...seeing
        these "kids" playing The Game better than most adults!
        My daughter, Lady Megan Kendra of Blackwood (L/Cpl Sharon Bradford, 
        USMC) and my youngest, Lord Phillip MhicRath of Locksley, Senior 
        Squire to Vis. Sir Elric ap Moray, seem to have growed up all of a 
        sudden.....

        I can certainly appreciate the lack of enthusiasm about forcing others
        to babysit toddlers, tho.....having had to take time out from MY fun
        to find some child's parents....but we NEVER did this. Letting a pre-
        sentient child run loose without adequate supervision is stupid and 
        neglectful, not to mention discourteous.
        I, personally, reccommend the "Seeing-Eye Child" toddler's leash to
        parents for such Smalls...works VERY well....perhaps staking out
        over an anthill would get the message across to some parents....

        Our kids are the SCA's future. Treat them kindly.

Subject: Well Struck!

A musing on spectators reactions. (or what's the use of
being old if you can't share some history with the new kids?)
The Eastern King's whims have reminded me of the variety of
reaction that I have seen and participated in over the last
years. When I first joined, and a fighter died, a team of
equirries ran out and carried the dead man off the field. 
Of course, at this time, full armor was a freon tank helm,
basketball pads on knees and elbows, and hockey gloves.
A bit later I remember a period when the ladies would swarm
onto the field, encircle the "corpse" and sing and dance a
"dirge" about him. 
Among the acceptable cries of encouragement have been:
"Eat Rattan Death!" and "Blood, blood, blood makes the grass
grow!" (as well as the more common "Well struck!" and "Ooohh!")
I have also seen ladies both throw their bodies across their
slain lord and shriek, and grab the fallen man's blade and
chase the winner off the feild with it. The most amusement I
remember ever generating was when I told my lord I wouldn't 
speak to him for an hour if he died. (This is only silly, as
opposed to dangerous, if one has ultimate faith that such a
threat would have no bearing on the warrior taking any blow.)
And of course, I can't forget the hordes waving their extended
arms, or two fingers, behind their heads chanting:"Bunny lord,
Bunny Lord!" In retrospect, I recall a heck of a lot more 
silliness than scorn among SCA spectators.

The easiest thing to do is to take the bow onboard with you and be
first in line at the boarding gate.  Ask one of the stewards/esses if
you can put the bow somewhere where it won't get in the way.  Usually
airlines can and will take care of items like wedding dresses, etc.
that can't go in the cargo hold.  I hope you're flying an airline on
which you share an airline, because trying to bring a tuba onto
Romanian airlines is a hellish experience...

As for your arrows, I'd suggest carefully wrapping them and trying to
bring them on as a carry-on.  However, depending on how tight security
is the airline might hang on to them for you.  And definitely keep
your bowstrings with you.  Good luck!

sweet dreams

Subject: The Viking Luau

Greetings (I hope) to the Rialto:

(We have now just been "inflicted" with EMC2 here, and it's so "user-
friendly" that us menu-phobics are having trouble with the simpler things)

     In reference to Lady Awilda's mention of the Viking Luau of years
ago, I wish to clarify some items, and point the Hawaiian print finger at
the appropriate miscreants.  The Luau was one of the several NorthWoods
camps at Pennsic that year (House Apathy - a loose assembly of people that
hang out together and do things together, but nobody's really cares what),
and because one of Sir Reynard's squires was camped there, he and his
entourage also landed there.  He was not the instigator or perpetrator -
just a willing participant :-) .  The REAL perpetrator was Lady Seigne
of NorthWoods, who found that flame-proof doll, and made all the tunics
(she made me one with lime-green toucans and hot-pink palm trees on black).
I could not allow the good name and steadfast reputation of Earl Sir Reynard
to be so darkened (or should it be brightened? tropical-printed?), and allow
the shadow (afterglow?) of such rumour to stain his reputation.

     From a more "historical" perspective, though, Baroness Dulcinea of
Hawkland Moor (congrats!) has a book that contains a historical overview
of Italian textiles, which is filled with photographs of period pieces of
fabric.  Most are in black and white (naturally - aargh!), but there are a
few color plates of renaissance brocades, of which the colors may surprise
some.  There is a vivid green-gold with wine-red figuring, one with what
looks like faded aqua with gold or orange on it, and from the descriptions
of the black and white photos, it would seem that lots of these brocades
were in colors that maximized contrast and "shock-value".  Things that
most moderns would probably balk at mixing.

     This brings to mind the concept of "period-look", which has been briefly
touched on the Rialto.  It has application to the mundane world, too.  The
state of Michigan has spent a good sum of money to renovate the old Capital
building in downtown Lansing.  It was constructed in the 1800s, and time and
use were slowly destroying it, until the legislature came up with $$ for
renovation and RESTORATION.  It was decided to try to restore the bulk of the
building to decoration and (where convenient) furnishings appropriate to the
initial design of the building.  It opened recently, and I took a quick tour
through the Senate chambers (if you like early Victoriana, you'll love it).
Well, it seems that some state senators weren't pleased - the colors were too
garish, it was too fussy, too much gold-leaf, and, to quote one senator,
"it looks like a whorehouse".  So far, nobody has been tasteless enough to
ask the senator why the chambers remind him of a whorehouse when it reminds
everyone else of an old-fashioned Senate chamber.

Subject: Middle Kingdom Crown Invitations

In Digest #683, Graedan mentioned that 'all those by Letters Patent...'
have been invited to Crown.  True, and it's happened the last three or
four times - that makes it traditional, time out of mind :-)  However,
the right of the Chivalry (Knights and Masters of Arms) to fight is
guaranteed by Kingdom Law.  The invitation to Laurels and Pelicans (and
Ladies of the Rose) is not legally mandated.

I remember that people were once really shocked when I suggested that
the automatic right of the Chivalry prevented a king from issueing only
one invitation...

Subject: Gloves, bows on planes, thanks, and so forth

Greetings, all, from Ariel.

Thanks to all of you who responded to this ignorant Celt's cries for help.
I am grateful, and look forward to being able to navigate my way around
netnews.  Thanks and thanks again!

Elizabeth Braidwood (hi!) asked about making gloves.  I don't know much about
it personally, but I know that the Amazon Pickling Works and Dry Goods Company
in Davenport, Iowa probably has everything you need: patterns, glovers' needles,
and probably a good selection of references.  They specialize in Victorian-era
stuff, but carry materials and sources for costumery from all centuries.

Get yourself a copy of Threads magazine; they always advertise in there, and
so would any other company that carries such stuff.  Good luck!

Dani asked about getting his bow on a plane.  (Too bad you couldn't have sent
it west with David Waxthorn, but how could you have known?)  I've never tried
it, but I believe that if you unstring the thing and put it in some sort of a
case, the airlines will allow you to carry it on the plane and hand it to a
flight attendant.  It would then be stored with the suit bags, pets in carriers,
and other things which aren't exactly luggage and aren't exactly passengers.
You'd get it back when you land.  Arrows would probably work the same way,
but probably better in a box marked FRAGILE.

This is just a guess, though.  Anyone out there actually tried this?  (This
is what a friend returning from England had to do with a stained glass window
she'd made in art school in London.  The plane people were great, but Customs
were comic.)

Good luck out there, BTW, and let us know when you get your next net account.

I have seen instances where, unfortunately, this sort of thing has occured.
The man (I refuse to call him a "gentle"...) in question had sought to 
"bestow his favors" upon a lady - within perhaps, 3 seconds, of her first
sound of struggle, a passing lord asked if everything was ok... it wasn't,
of course, and the man was asked to leave the event immediately.  Furthermore,
the lady enjoyed the company of two guards outside her tent for the remainder
of the evening.  What I found most commendable was that this assistance was 
totally "unofficial" - that's just the way the majority of the gentles within
the Society behave.

Subject: squire's spurs

To all frequenters of the Rialto, greetings!

In a recent digest Arastorm the Golden (I  think it was) mentioned that
in some areas squires wore spurs, but not in others. I'm enquiring about
the historical basis of these rules. I think everyone's heard the term
'winning their spurs' used when someone proves themselves in action,
and the spurs of knighthood are a standard Victorian-chivalry idea,
but how much truth was there in it? After all squires were horsemen too
and needed spurs just as much as their knights. Was it involved with the
vigil idea, and getting a new knight's equipment blessed by the church,
and therefore made special, or what?

I'm afraid I have just as much Hollywood-misinformation in this area as
anyone, so all the above is probably completely wrong. I'd appreciate
such corrections and information as any gentle may post.

Inne a spirit of enquere,

Jim Deakin.

There was an interseting show on PBS a few years ago. It dealt
with armor and knighthood in the middle ages. As I understand
it, common practice was in a tournement, the losers horse, arms,
and armor were forfeit to the winner. After the tournament they would
be ransomed back to the loser. The ransom was most likely considerably
less then the actual cost of the armor. 

As to how landless knights could support themselves, there are
two interesting references. These landless knights are the basis
for the evil black knights of the storybooks. These knights were
profeesional tournament fighters. As they had no land, they could
not afford to keep squires to polish their armor. To keep it
from rusting, the armor was painted black. A common occurrence
after a tournament was all the other knights ransoming their
armor from the black knight. This is also the origin of the
term blackmail. They had to pay or else.

I hate to interject a "reality-check" here, but  I  couldn't let this pass:
(sorry, Hal, I  know you probably  didn't mean to  trivialize rape  in your
statement, but your  implication  comes up too  often for me to just ignore
it out of hand.)

Date-rape is Rape.  Rape is a crime of  VIOLENCE,  usually (but not always)
perpetrated by men against  women.   Rape  is NOT sex.  Mundane law doesn't
recognize  any   difference between   "date-rape" and   rape.      The term
"date-rape" is not a legal term and only implies that those involved in the
rape had been  together  in a  social situation  (a  date) before  the rape
occurred, not that it is any less of a crime.

I am really offended that "post-coital regret" be equated with ANY  type of
rape because it  trivializes the act of rape.   Face it,  there is  alot of
emotional  and psychological trauma involved  in  a situation where someone
FORCES you to do something  you are  against especially when there's little
you can  do about it.    It's extremely frightening because the   odds  are
getting  better and better  that you or  someone you know  has been will be
involved in one.

Nobody "invites rape" by what they wear.  Just  because someone shows a bit
of leg or some cleavage,  or drinks a bit too  much, doesn't mean they're a
tramp and they deserve to be victimized,  especially in this way.  "Regular
guys" do  not rape people,  so DON'T identify yourself  with an attacker if
you hear about one.

Rape is a serious  crime and it's heartening  that SCA-folks  would help to
insure  it doesn't  happen when   we're around,  but don't  rationalize  or
trivialize in your mind by thinking about it as an act of sex.  It's not.

Unto the good gentles of the Rialto :
 
I ahve checked with the autocrat of Lillies, and there is no arranged
transport from the airport to the war site.  However, I called Greyhound,
and they have a bus from Kansas City to Odessa once a day.  It leaves the
downtown terminal at 6:30 PM, and arrives in Odessa around 7:20 PM.  Note
that the town of Odessa is south of I-70 and Camp Odessa Hills (war site) is
a couple of miles north of I-70.  Unfortunately I have no idea how you can
get to the camp from Odessa.  The cost is $7.72 one way, and $ 14.69 round
trip.  I forgot to ask when the return bus goes.
 
To get to the Greyhound terminal from the airport, there is the KCI Airport
Express Bus.  It runs every half hour (:00 and :30) and costs $9.00 one way.
 
This area is not known for its public transportation, as the car is king.

Back when I was an Italian Renaissance lady, I did some reading up on my prototypes.
I believe the following is a Caterina Sforza story;  if not, it's about one
of her Italian contemporaries.  It *is* said to be a true story, whichever
lady it attaches to.

The lady in question (call her Caterina for the time being) was defending her
besieged castle.  Alas, her eldest son was captured by the besiegers, who called
her to parley.  When she came to the castle heights, they told her that, unless she
surrendered the castle, they would torture and murder her son.  Caterina promptly
lifted her skirts to the waist and shouted down, "Go ahead, there are plenty more
where he came from!".  [I don't remember what, if anything, happened to the son
after that.]  When the siege was, eventually, successful, Caterina was allowed to
leave the castle freely, in respect for her great courage.

Subject: Letting Children Run Loose

Greetings to the Rialto from Elizabeth Braidwood - who wishes to speak
a little on the topic of "Letting Children Run Loose".

Ioseph of Locksley in Digest #683, said something like "After my children
learned the meaning of the word 'Hold' we let them run loose because
everyone watches out for everyone else."

I have trouble with this. (Please note that I've never met Ioseph or his
family and therefore cannot possibly be commenting on him or his children
specifically.) I am tired of parents who use SCA events as a group
baby-sitting service. I am speaking of those people who come to events
with their offspring and turn them loose; depending on the kindness of
strangers to keep their children amused, fed and safe from harm.

Yes, SCA events are very safe places. And I have no problems with nurturing
a child who has accidentally wandered away from Mommy or Daddy and is
distress. I have no problem with children who wander about - but are always
in view of a parents' watchful eye. But I *do* have problems with parents
who encourage their children to "go away" and are quite happy to not see
them all day, allowing them to impose on strangers - on the strength
that "we all look out for each other." Frequently, these children have
not been taught the basics of courtesy - such as asking before touching
other peoples' things or knowing when it's time to go home.

I am a childless person. And while this may contribute to my sensitivity
in this manner, I am not the only one who feels this way! I suspect that
responsible parents feel even more put-upon to watch the children of absent
parents - and resent the imposition.

There are some really great kids in the SCA. From the time they toddle
around the eric holding on to the strap in Daddy's leg-armour to the day
they receive their first kingdom-level award, these young people are great
to have around. They seem to have absorbed manners and chivalry from the
very air (silly image - they've got responsible parents who set a good
example). You welcome them into your camp because you know you can trust
them and because it is pleasant to share their company.  It is unfortunate
that well- and gentle-mannered children do not attract the attention that
the other beasties do.

Parents, take a close look at your attitudes concerning your children at
events. Yes, your child may have been born into the SCA and everyone around
the eric knows who he/she is. But that does not mean we are willing to
tolerate their imposition while you are busy fighting/dancing/sleeping/
whatever.

(Don't know why I bothered posting this - the parents who are aware of
the problems do not let their children run loose.)

So - enought soapbox. I'll go back to telling the child to "Go Find Mommy".

Subject: Guidelines and safety for smalls

Greetings!
I was interested in the comments for and against guidelines (rules?)
for the SCA.  IMHO, I think certain concrete guidelines could be a
good thing.  "Period" is so ambiguous -- if our "period" were
defined that would be one more step towards grounding ourselves in
recreation, instead of a nebulous "medievalishness".  Also, it does
seem to be a rule that fantasy beings are not valid personas, and
that our game involves would could have been real people -- hence,
barbarians of a stripe that never existed anywhere except in some
fantasy novelists' heads, elves, and other such beings aren't part
of this particular game.  Backing off from any rules at all is an
easy way to avoid thinking about what we're about and what we're
*not*.
Also, I must disagree with the gentle who wrote about safety for
smalls who seemed to be saying that once a child is old enough to
know what "hold" means the child can be left to wander in safety
.  Not that I mean to flame anyone, but a two year old can learn
that "hold" means "stop in your tracks" while still needing
supervision.  Our campsites and most event sites are far from
childproof.  And when a parent takes the attitude "I don't have
to worry about little X because everyone will keep an eye out"
that can lead to danger or at the very least, other gentles
being pressed into babysitting without their consent.  While it
may be true that children are safe from malicious adults in the
SCA environment, they are not safe from the physical environment
or just plain boredom unless those responsible for them take
care.  I have heard rumors about at least one kingdom that has
rules about unsupervised smalls and penalties for parents who
let children under the age of say, five, wander.  Any comments?

One of the truly wonderful things about the SCA, I think is that even though
we may get into (sometimes heated) debates about just what exactly we're
trying to do :-), there is a very strong sense that whatever it is, we're
all in it together.  SCA folks seem to be very good at coming to other
peoples' assistance.  The volunteer guard story that Richard related is
a good example, but there are many others.  A recent one that comes to mind
was the SCA member who was riding his motorcycle to an event (wearing his
armor, as there was no where to stow it), saw an accident, stopped, and
said, "I'm a nurse--how can I help?".  Also, my opinion of the Dark Horde
has been raised several times by watching them help people who have been
washed out of their tents at the Pennsic War.

It's a nice contrast to the "I don't wanna get involved" attitude that seems
to pervade mundane life...

Subject: Blackmail, Sforza/Marshall connection

"A common occurrence after a tournament was all the other knights
ransoming their armor from the black knight. This is also the origin
of the term blackmail." (Roger Stockton, on a PBS show)

I would not take this "history" very seriously, at least not without
better authority than PBS. I have seen a scholarly discussion of the
origin of the term "blackmail;" it had nothing to do with knights. My
Webster's gives a different origin, but again not the one you cite.
It sounds to me like a guess metamorphosed into a fact by one or two
repetitions.

To judge by William Marshall's history, landless knights were
typically retainers of some landed lord, who supported them. Duby, in
"William Marshall: Flower of Chivalry," argues that the crucial point
in a knight's career was gaining land and getting married, which
usually happened together, either by marrying an heiress (as William
did), or acquiring enough land to settle down and get married. Many
knights never succeeded; they were, in essense, mercenary soldiers.

Betsy Perry tells a story about Caterina Sforza or one of her
contemporaries, of which the punch line is "there are plenty more
where he came from!" Essentially the same story is told about Gilbert
Marshall, William Marshall's father, when Stephen threatened to kill
the young William (who had been given as a hostage) if his father did
not yield up his castle as he had promised to do. The punch line in
that case was "have I not still the hammer and the anvil with which
he was forged?" I think there was also something about having four
sons and only one castle.

This raises an interesting question: are the stories connected? One
possibility is that someone heard the Marshall story (which has to be
the earlier since it was recorded before the other was supposed to
have happened) and decided to Italianize it. Another possibility is
that it was an obvious crack to make in such a situation, and
occurred to at least two different people (either making it for real,
or attributing it to notable figures).

Perhaps packing it between 2 stout boards and carrying it in a ski bag
might work.  The airlines seemd to manage skis without terrible damage.
And if the bow is well-wrapped in cloth and plastic, it should avaoid the

Ummm, actually, it doesn't require anything but a splicing block and splicing tape,
and razor blade, all available from the neighborhood Radio Shack.  Now, to splice
music TOGETHER takes a bit more.  However, to just build cassettes of the proper
length takes very little equipment at all, and an investment of about $25.00.

Oh, and some practice, of course.

(This comes from nearly a year of being a radio Engineer, and several years of being
a recording engineer).

P.S.  If you're REALLY talented, you can dispense with the splicing block - I've done it

} In the "dark ages" of personal computing...  used cassette tape for

} tape, but if it was sensitive enough for digital data storage (in analog
} form), then it should be good enough for dance music....

No, in fact music recorded on them sounds poor, if not awful.  The
requirements for storing digital data are completely different.  If you
want to know what recorded music on data tapes sounds like, record a
tune on an ordinary cassette on a really cheap boombox, then play it
repeatedly (about 6 dozen times should do it :-) on that really cheap
deck with a dirty, badly magnetized head.  Once all that annoying
clarity is gone, and all you have left is some muddy mid-range, you'll
have a good approximation.

Here's an idea: use the shortest commonly available tapes, which I
suppose are 30 minutes -- 15 minutes per side.  You could record one of
your "dance favorites" *repeatedly* on one side of a tape.  Then you can
always get to that song right away.  So you might have a number of these
"singles" in your collection, as well as your mixed sequence tapes.

By the way, opening cassettes, splicing tape, and putting cassettes back
together is not a job for amateurs.  It's possible, but it needs some
special equipment and lots of practice.  If you know someone at a
recording studio or radio station who can show you how, it would help.

This is correct.  Once again we seem to be on the topic of the Middle
Kingdom's crown list.  For those of you who don't know what this is,
the Mid-realm has an "invitation only" policy concerning its Crown
Tourney.  Right or wrong, this is an "ancient tradition" stretching
back many years.  As I am sure many people can guess, the Kings of the
Mid-realm seem to have differing views of how and why this should stay
in place.  The system has seemed to work well enough so no one has removed
it, however, the criteria by which people are chosen for inclusion is
certainly the right and whim of the Tanist of the Middle Kingdom.  Their
seems to be two views:
	1)  Invite only those individuals whom the Prince, with the
		help of Peers of the realm, feels have a reasonable
		chance at winning.  This is usually results in the
		standard blanket invitation to the Chivalry and select
		list of Unbelted fighters and other peers.
	2)  Invite those individuals whom the Prince, with the
		help the Kingdom Peers, feel would be an acceptible
		candidate for The Crown.  This always seems to result
		in a larger list of unbelted fighters, and a blanket
		invite to all of the Peers of the Kingdom.
Both are certainly valid points of view, although it seems that Crown
list has seen a slow evolution toward the second view in recent years.
Another reason that the system has stayed in place is that the Mid-realm
has no intermediate level general fighting award, like the Tiger's
Combatant of the East, and the Order of the Huscarls (Sp?) in Calontir.
As a result recognition of the good fighters who aren't ready for Knighthood
is difficult.

Subject: re: Personal Safety in SCA Camps

I quite agree with Hal about SCA camping events and the personal safety of
attendees, except for Pennsic.

Unfortunately, I would not let a nubile young lady under age walk around
unchaperoned at Pennsic, unless I trusted her implicitly to only go to
certain camps (her friends and "Uncles".  Let me explain that later).

Unfortunately, Pennsic is *not* your local camping event of 100-500 people,
most of whom now someone or are active members in the SCA.  Even newcomers
have some relationship with someone else there and will have certain social
graces explained to them.  The SCA is the only group that *I* am involved
in where I can flirt outrageously all evening with someone and be
comfortable knowing that when I say "thanks for a fun evening" and leave, I
won't be harrassed.

However, the Pennsic Wars do gather their own collection of people.  There
is a group, all be it small, of folks who come to Pennsic because of it's
"party" atmosphere and have little interest in the SCA.  They don't have
the mentor to teach them the social graces or their mentor is too busy
having his own fun to worry about them.  I will probably get jumped on for
this, but this is my general impression that has been gathered after a
number of years of attending Pennsic.  It's not that I don't trust the SCA
as a whole, it's that I don't trust some of the types that come to Pennsic
and all I am saying is to be aware of this.  

Now, as I said, unless you can trust the young lady to attend parties only
in certain camps.  A good friend of ours (who has finally turned 18 and
will be attending her *first* Pennsic this year), has collected a family of
"Aunts" and "Uncles"  after being in the SCA for 6 years.  Most of her
"family" have titles (lots of Dukes, Counts, Knights, Barons, Duchesses,
Countesses, Baronesses, etc.) and even those who don't aren't worth messing
with.  Even tho she is 18, I have impressed (hopefully) upon her that she
is best to camp-hop where she is known and where she knows people, which
for her is a good 1/3-1/2 of Pennsic anyway!

There, that is my personal opinion.

First and foremost, call the airline(s) you plan on using and *ask them*!
They are the ultimate authority in this matter, and by this you may avoid
the problem of following someone's advice just to be denied at the gate.

You should probably look into some type of hard-shell case for it and your
arrows. A suggestion would be to use large diameter PVC piping, glue one 
end-cap on, and use riveted straps to hold to other end closed. Duke
Frederik of Holland uses such tubes to contain his pavilion poles for
transport, they are simple and work very well.

Ummm, at least one more word is DEFINITELY needed to be understood, to be safe,
and at least two more phrases to interact reasonably.

The one necessary to safety is "CLEAR", and the two phrases are "Please", and
"Thank You".  ;^)

And all this discussion reminds me of the venerable *Industrial

years. Many a novice recieved his or her first lessons in combat while 
encased in that thing. It was bright blue, plastic, cunningly made from a
large drum of some industrial floor cleaner. On the breast plate, in
big neon letters were the words "Handle with Caution. Hazards may
include wet and slippery floors. Keep away from children and pets."

Now I ask you, how could you cover a thing like that in a surcoat?

Subject: Personna definitions?

Golly, I'm gone for two weeks and look at how much I missed! Whew!
And I thought that it was sunburn on my shoulders...who knew?

I've read the past two weeks of postings about personnas...it seems
that some sort of definitions could clarify things.

Personna seems to be used to describe the following:
(in order of no particular significance)
1) SCA name used to distinguish members from each other, registerable
or not. ie. Megan ni Laine de Belle Rive

2) A vague concept of what an SCA participant might have been had he
or she lived in the actual middle ages, or thereabouts. Megan lived
somewhere in the fifteenth century in Flanders. 

3) A specific fiction concerning a person who could have lived in the
middle ages, whom the SCA participant is pretending to be at events.ie.
Megan the Limner who lives in Bruge in 1490.

4) A personal history of # 2 or # 3, including invented life
experiences and family trees. ie. Megan was born of Irish parents who
immigrated to Flanders with the wool trade, she showed an early
aptitude for art which was encouraged by her parents, she married
young to an illuminator and was widowed soon after, continued her late
husbands business on her own, ad nauseum. You get the idea. 

5) A real person who does real stuff, but who only or primarily exists
within the SCA..ie. Megan the Limner of Stonemarche or Megan the
Baroness of Stonemarcne as opposed to Linda Anfuso, SCA member.

6) The concept of only talking about or participating in medieval
recreation activities at events. ie. the Enchanted Ground

7) The concept of only talking about or participiting in SCA related
activities at events, which may  or may not include any of the above,
but definately excludes references to 20th century or non medieval
stuff.ie. referring to this correspondance as the *Rialto* versus the
*Computer net*

This is just off the top of my head, and is by no means complete or to
be assumed to be anything approaching official.  

WE should differentiate between these by stating more precisely what
we mean...personna versus personna stories, versus staying in
personna, etc. Again, we have invented concepts and must find accurate
ways to describe them.

In my posting in which I queried about people who do not have
personnas, I was not specific enough. Are there people in the SCA who
do SCA activities soley as 20th century medievalists, without the
fictional names or historical references? This seems to exclude much
SCA stuff...participating in kingdoms, heraldry, costume, etc. But
perhaps I misunderstood. Of course we all participate on different
levels. And some of us participate on several levels all at once.

As long as opinions are being posted...here's my two cents worth:
(or perhaps I should say two groats?)

EVeryone in the SCA should have a Medieval Name, to allow themselves to
step out of the twentieth century into the Current Middle Ages at
least, and into something approximating their best concept of the
actual middle ages at most. (no matter how hard we try, none of us can
ever truly think like a medieval person. Our twentieth century
experiences form the way we think too strongly, and we know too little
about the actual life experiences of the medieval person to wholly
replicate them. A romantic fiction based on solid history may be the
best we can pull off)

Everyone should have an historical period of interest, to specialize
in. There is so much to learn, to confine oneself to a single year and
single locale within any period could be a lifelong study. Specialize
and we will all be the richer for it, no matter how deep or shallowly
you delve.

Everyone should have something to do which has an historical medieval
counterpart, so they can increase their skills, enrich the medieval
ambiance of our events, and furthur our education. Also, it's more
challenging and fun to be authentic.

It isn't nice to tell someone that the effort they expended to play
the game isn't good enough. People have different resources and skill levels.

Personna histories make interesting reading, but boring conversation.
Tell me about what you have really done, with your own sweat and
blood. Anyone can claim to have fought in the crusades, but show me
your bruises from yesterday's tourney, and you've got my attention.

I think we invent personnas to enhance or justify our medieval
recreation activity. It is more interesting to pretend to actually be
a medieval limner while grinding pigment than to do it in a tshirt and
jeans as a 20th century historian. 

Well, I've been sitting at this terminal for 7 hours now...if I say
anything more I will become incoherent and make a bigger fool of
myself than I already have. 

Megan, Limner, Baroness, Mistress of the Laurel and sometime carrot peeler.
But still weighing a Ko and 1/3, sunburn and all.
 
PS While I was in Jamaica I stayed near where Columbus lived. He's in
my period. What a concept!

Greetings!

This posting is written at the behest of His Royal Majesty, King Arlof of 
Trimaris.

His Majesty wishes to enquire of the, and through the, Atlanteans and 
Meridiens of the Rialto as to whether any video tapes were made of Fool's War. 
If there are any such, HRM would very much like to arrange the receipt of a 
copy.

Contact with HRM Arlof can be made through me, and if necessary I can help 
make the arrangement for getting the tape copy.

Thank you.

Subject: The losers

Greetings!

Anatar Mael Duin points out the importance of booty in tournaments.
Knights took other knights prisoner and held them for ransom, those
who were defeated lost their horses and armor to the winners, and so on. 

We have discussed earlier on the net how expensive arms and armour were.
The great chargers (horses) were also extremely costly. How could a
landless knight afford these things, except if they were given to him by
his lord? According to the history books, most knights were poor and owned
little more than the "tools of the trade".

I just wonder how this system could work. I mean, if about half the knights
in every tournament lost all their most expensive equipment, then this
should logically mean that scores of destitute knights had to walk back
home after the tournament and beg new equipment from their lords. How
willing would a lord be to simply give away a fortune in this manner?

If a large number of people lost the means of their livelihood in every
tournament, wouldn't this ultimately have depleted the supply of knights?
Wouldn't it have created a horde of ex-knights who had lost out of the
soldier business? There must have been a workable way for the losers to
get back into the saddle. Either the rich lords were very generous and
replaced lost equipment to all their vassals. Or the price of loss was
not as high as it would seem.

The winners would probably sell off their booty for money. If the only
buyers of such goods were destitute (loser) knights, prices must have
gone down drastically as a result. Richer winners might also have given
the booty away to poor knights, who perhaps became their vassals as a
result.

Does anyone on the net have any bright ideas about this? What happened to
the losers? How serious was the loss they suffered if they were forced to
yield? Was there a large number of knights who had to leave the profession
because they had lost their equipment? How would they go about getting it
back?

Curiously yours,
William de Corbie

Subject: Screwy things on planes

Greetings to the Rialto, from Margrethe von Holbeck!

Dani of the Seven Wells writes of wishing to take a 5 foot long bow on
a plane.  As a frequent traveler, perhaps I can help.

1)  Wrap it in a garbage bag or a clear plastic bag.  Carry it with
you onto the plane.  Ask the stewardess if you can store it WITH the
garment bags- I believe it will fit.

2) If it doesn't fit, look pathetic and ask the stewardesses where you
might possibly put it.  Trust me, this *will* work; they know that otherwise
it will end up in the aisles and they will be tripping over it.

3) if you are wealthy and desperate, buy it a seat.

4) Do NOT, under any circumstances, try taking the arrows with you on
board.  The security check will think you are trying to hijack the plane.
Trust me:  I tried to take a celtic fork from last summer's Arts and Sciences
tourney on board with me.  Security was convinced that I was going to
murder someone with it.  ("That is a historical REPRODUCTION.  I use it
to EAT WITH.  I am NOT going to kill anyone with it.")

Be prepared to do a lot of patient explaining about why it won't do to put
it in the luggage compartment.  If you are still worried, you might also
call the ticketing department of the airline on which you plan to travel
and describe your needs.  Since deregulation, they've gotten very good
at that.

Good luck!

"Also, they didn't burn anybody over religion,"
(Awilda, about Iceland)

Burn, no. Kill, yes. The controversies leading up to the settlement
of the Christian/Pagan conflict in 1000 A.D. involved killing,
mostly, as I recall, of pagans by Christians, although, like most
Icelandic violence, it was on a very small and personal scale. The
(arbitrated) settlement of the dispute made public pagan worship
illegal, although private pagan worship was permitted, at least for a
while. You do not specify when Awilda is.

"So I plan to attend another group only slightly farther away.  I am
not the only person who has chosen to vote with my feet, I've met a
number of other people who decline to participate in shire life in
anything more than a minimum way because ... . "

This strikes me as a sensible reaction to such a situation. Why waste
time and energy fighting over control of local offices that do not
really matter, when you could be doing something interesting and
useful instead? In our area, we have four or five active groups, and
although there is a nominal geographic division, in practice people
do things with whatever group or groups they like.

If there is only one group available, I still think the best strategy
for dealing with unpleasant politics is to refuse to play; like most
of the things we do, politics is a voluntary game. Spend your time
doing whatever you like in the SCA instead. You do not need
permission from your local MoA to make medieval jewelry or do
cooking, nor from your local KM to fight a friend in your back yard.
Eventually, the people who are playing politics will either get tired
or discover that they are irrelevent.

On the general subject of safety at Pennsic, I agree with those who
regard it as a very safe place to wander around. My son, who is now
thirteen, has spent the last several Pennsics functioning as an
independent individual. We make sure he eats and occasionally gets
clean, but aside from that he goes where he wants when he wants, and
never seems to have had any problems. My lady wife wanders about at
all hours, and again has had no problems.

"As for 'lady knights' ...Let not be forgotten that fair knight
Britomartis, either, " (Graydon)

Nor Ariosto's Bradamante, the original from whom Spenser splagiarized
Britomartis. But remember that Ariosto is a renaissance writer
deliberately producing outrageously improbably fantasy fiction. If
you take him as an authority, you can also prove that the Middle Ages
contained hippogriffs, magic fountains galore, ... .

The most noticible benefit from SCA membership is getting your kingdom
newsletter.  That way you'll know what events are coming up and who
to contact in your area.  Who knows--a new branch may spring up near by--
and if you're a member--you'll find out right away.  Second--you get
TI and get to read articles on how to do useful things and see the
fruits of research done by SCA folk.  Third--you'll be helping pay for
such underlying infrastructure as it takes to run the SCA--things like
insurance and running the Stock Clerk's office.

There is no e-mail address.  *However*, as I see you have provided your

Subject: Ladies in combat

The following is from the introduction to one of the Penguin Classics, "Orlando
Furioso" (part I), pp. 50-51 (speaking of early 16th-century Italy):

"Women... exist also as personages in their own right.  This is to be expected
in a period when Italian women received essentially the same education as men.
The daughters of a noble house shared in the same studies as the sons, the New
Learning being regarded as among the noblest of earthly pursuits....  Women
were expected to strive after complete intellectual and emotional development
and were regarded as the equals of men.  Caterina Sforza, known as the 'first
lady of Italy', had the valour and courage of a heroic cavalier.  As the wife
and later the widow of Girolamo Riario, lord of Forli, she gallantly defended
his possessions in battle, first against his murderers and later against Cesare
Borgia."

(Ariosto had Bradamante and Marfisa as lady warriors in the Furioso, which is
what promoted this discussion.)

This is, of course, not a primary source, but the scholarship is likely to be
sound.  Is there anyone on the Rialto who can tell us more about Caterina
Sforza?  For example, did she "merely" ride into battle or did she actually get
to whack people upside the head with a mace? :-)

Subject: Landmarks (long)

Greetings to the Rialto!

Justin asks for landmarks of the Society.  I would like to propose one that I
think ought to be a landmark; I believe that attempting to follow it is
widespread in the Society, although the attempts do not always succeed.

This "landmark" is what people commonly refer to as "the Dream."  This means
different things to different people, and Duke Cariadoc has said that the best
moments in the SCA are when you can imagine yourself to be in a different
world.  I think that is a necessary condition but not a sufficient one, and
that that particular statement, while largely true, is somewhat misleading.

The magic in the Society is not in feeling that you are in a different world,
but that you are in a *better* world.  (The fact that you are in a different
world is just a side effect: a world better than this one must perforce be a
different one.)  If I imagined myself to truly be transported to (say) a Civil
War battlefield, I would feel no magic, and I suspect most people feel much the
same.  When people look on historical recreations and feel magic, they are
either romanticizing or are enjoying the spectacle rather than enjoying
participation.

The magic in these Lands comes not especially from authenticity, or from "fun"
in the usual sense that fun mavins use the word.  It comes from how people
treat one another: what we call "chivalry," what is mundanely called courtesy.
What we emulate here is really a romanticized version of medieval manners such
as can be found in Ariosto or Mallory, and at best intermittently in the true
Middle Ages.

The most refreshing thing about the Society is that people can treat one
another well without being thought strange.  In the real world, if you treat
someone well who is above you in your corporate hierarchy, you are
brown-nosing; if they are below you, you are a wimp; if at the same level, you
are insincere and clearly have an ulterior motive.  If the person is of the
opposite sex, your actions may also be interpreted as sexual harassment.  Think
about it: is this picture really very exaggerated?  The real-world tendency is
to place the most evil possible interpretation on every action and statement.
There is some of this taint in the Society, too, but in the Society there is at
least a recognition that it is a bad thing, and a sincere attempt to do better.

What this means is that the best aspect of the Society has nothing to do with
its formal goals, and is entirely cultural.  This aspect could just as well
exist if the society were recreating a fantasy world, or an imagined future
world.  But this aspect is a very powerful attractant for new members, and
hence useful even if one assumes (fantastically and implausibly) that the sole
purpose of the SCA is education as delineated by Corpora.  Honey catches more
flies than vinegar.

Concrete examples of how this kind of courtesy works are innumerable.  If my
gaze lingers on a lady, it is admiration, not leering.  If a lord boasts
overmuch about his and his comrades' martial feats, he is momentarily flushed
with victory, not a braggart.  Softly spoken criticisms and suggestions are
meant to help and are not part of some dreary dominance game.  (But beware, ye
helpful critics: I once explained to someone that argent meant silver and was
"corrected" by a gentle who thought it really meant white!)  If someone has in
the past been objectionable in some way, it is not assumed that they must
forever be this way.  You can supply your own examples.

These examples are clearly idealizations; by no means are the manners of the
Society a perfect match to these.  Violations of this ideal are certainly
rampant in the SCA, and there are probably few people who obey it perfectly.
It is nevertheless irrefutably self-evident that the ideal is more closely held
to than in the real world, and it is much more widely appreciated that the
ideal is in fact a good thing.  There is a very visible difference between the
Current Middle Ages and Mundania.

So, Gentles, this is my proposed landmark: the Dream, meaning a particular
application of the Golden Rule to speech and mannerisms; not "simple" courtesy,
but a very profound and all-encompassing courtesy.  May it live forever.

In service to the Dream,

--

On the subject of offensive clothing, does any one else remember the Viking
Luau Sir Renard (now count Renard) had at Pennsic a few years ago?  This was a
truly wretched (and thoroughly amusing event) which was advertised by members
of his household (good vikings all) wearing Hawaiian print surcotes and
tabards, the principle colors were blue and orange, and the pattern very large,
and very bright.  

At the Luau we burned a cabbage patch doll at the stake, then pronounced it
guilty of excessive cuteness, then held its trial.  In that order.  You know,
flame retardents in kids' toys work.  Burning that doll was a heck of a lot of
work.  We ended up roasting ribs over it because it was hogging the fire for
too long.  We also ate watermelon.  I'm sure the Authenticity Police would have
put us away forever if they'd had the nerve to attend...

Persona and reality.

Well, my persona does and has a lot of stuff I never will.  Although I looked
very seriously at building a scaled down, fully functional version of the
Gokstad Ship as my master's thesis.  Never did go for my master's so it didn't
matter tha I couldnt' afford to build it even if I had.  Awilda, on the other
hand, does own a longship.  Awilda also sleeps in a Viking tent with carved
tent poles, but I have to make do with a nylon mushroom.  Awilda has been to
Miklagard, and Vinland, and lives in Iceland currently.  I've been off the
North American continent, but  only to the Caribean.  Awilda would be rather
disturbed at the sight of tourquoise houses and poinsettias, I liked them. I,
on the other hand, would be rather disturbed if I had to carryout bloodfeud, a
undertaking that Awilda would perform assidiously as a necessary social duty.
(How else do you punish people who refuse to live by the law?  No prisons in
Iceland.)

On the other hand, Awilda nad I do share ideas about a variety of things.  In
Iceland, women had considerably more rights than Contintal women, which is why
Awilda decided to settle there.  Also, they didn't burn anybody over religion,
which also appealed, as Awilda is perfectly willing to worship whatever god she
can get the best deal from (and has picked up a few Christian and Greek gods to
add to her pantheon).  This attitude seems perfectly sensible to her, but the
Christians don't agree... And Awilda and I do have similar attitudes about
slavery: its perfectly reasonable to force people who commit crimes to labor to
compensate society  for the damage they've done. But Awilda considers prisoners
of war to appropriate slave material too.  I agree, prisoners of war are
generally put to work in the United States, the difference is, they can be
traded back to where they came from, at the worst they have to wait until the
end of the war to gain their freedom.  For Awilda such an arrangement is
permanent, unless the owner (an individual, not a governemnt) should choose to
emancipate them.   

I picked Vikings because they were fun, but I've also tried out a variety of
other persona possiblities.  I have costumes ranging from kimono to cotehardie
in my closet.  Even an Itlaian Rennaissance.  But I find I have to play a
persona who's actually reasaonably close to myself in atttitudes to be
comfortable.  And so the cotehardie and Italian costumes rarely see the light
of day, even though they are some of my best garb.  I'd rather bum around in a
mangy kimono being an untouchable entertainer than go through all the hassle of
getting dressed up in formal kimonos and formal samurai manners.  It also
allows me to play games with the samurai persona.  You can tell who's an
Oriental persona, and who's just round eye in drag by their reaction when I hit
the dirt kowtowing to them.  Americans are rather disturbed and want me to
stand up and talk to them.  Japanese persona take it as their due. So far,
nobody's taken it as their due.

But my Japanese persona is different from my Viking persona.  Awilda is a
respectable member of her society and subscribes to her society's mores.
Suyesumuhana has opted out of her society, a very dangerous thing, but more
fun.  Who wants to be a baby factory wrapped up miles of red tape and correct
etiquette?  Life for Suyestumuhana is easy: Agree to whatever they say, and
when they aren't looking, do what you want to do.

My sister was in a period play where one of the characters was a Spaniard.  In
one scene, the Englishmen and the Spaniard drew swords to decided who would get
to go up and see the girl first.  The swords were compared for length, and the
Englishmen were much chagrined to be reminded that Toledo blades were longer
than English ones.  Footnotes to the play said that Spanish blades were on
an average several inches longer than English ones.  This conforms to the
pieces in  the Michigan State University vault.  Their Toledo steel was not
ridiculous in length, just a little longer than the other European blades they
had.  The Toledo steel was approximately as long as a katana.  I would think
that a blade four to five feet in length would prove to be rather too unwieldy
for self defense. 

The transfer of Maryland to Atlantia.

To put it politely, Maryland has had an interesting history.  As best as I can
piece together the story from its survivors is that while Myrkwood was part of
the East Kingdom, the southern East Kingdom suffered a near fatal attack of
politics.  Groups were broken up, demoted, rearranged and in Myrkwood's case,
handed over to another kingdom. These politics were sufficiently bad to require
BoD intervention.  The old battle lines still remain.  I've forgotten just what
the alliances and enemities are, and I don't care, but I've heard an earful of
them.  But Bright Hills, since it has a rather prominent clique of Myrkwood
survivors still active as autocrats and officers, still adheres to old
prejudices.  We will support certain groups, we will not support others. Some
even go so far as to consider it disloyal to have friends among these other
groups, or to attend their events.  This narrowminded parochial attitude is a
real pain in the chivalry, and I am heartily glad my term of office is nearly
over.  I will go stick my head in the sand and ignore this vigorously until
they all go away.  Unfortunately, one thing you can say about the Olde Garde:
they're tenacious.  So I plan to attend another group only slightly farther
away.  I am not the only person who has chosen to vote with my feet, I've met a
number of other people who decline to participate in shire life in anything
more than a minimum way because they are disgusted by the fact that people
insist upon beating dead dogs.   
 
As to what territory is what, it breaks up this way: Southern Maryland: Barony
of Lochmere; Baltimore and Harford counties (north central Maryland, including
Baltimore City) : Bright Hills; Frederick County (just west of Balt. city) :
Highland Foord.  All other territory: unclaimed.  No groups exist east of the
Chesapeake Bay, not in Delaware or Maryland.  The few Delaware members sort of
float around between Philadephia and Baltimore events.  But because old
friendships among high level people dating back to before the break up still
exist, there's a strong connection between Bright Hills and Bakhail (Phillie).
Maryland lives in a sort of in interkingdom limbo, which hopefully will be
 largely ended by Garb WArs.  Hosting a two kingdom mega event has got to knock 
some people out of their ruts, particularly when we're getting strong support 
from our kingdom officers. I  haven't heard the old refrain "They don't care
about us, they never come to our events, they never give us awards" lately. 
For which I am heartily glad. 

Now, are you really sure you wanted to know why Myrkwood died and Maryland
transferred?  I think it is probably the worst set of politics the SCA has ever
experienced, and I am not pleased to be a part of it.

Milord Hal,

By my reading of your posting, I would speculate that what you meant by
"date rape" and what I understand it to mean are quite different.  The
date rape phenomenom really is about rape, not about post coital regret.
Post coital regret is saying yes, and then in the morning wishing  you
had said no.  Date rape is not being allowed to say no - or saying no and
being ignored.  I realize this isn't the forum for an extended discussion,
and would be more than willing to move to a private forum if you (or
anyone) would like.  I wanted to take the opportunity perhaps to raise
a little awareness.

Incidentally - and as more than one gentle has already commented - the
knightly behavior of society members is such to bring massive amounts of
assistance on short notice in any such situation.  Any person ungentlemanly
enough to persist in unwanted attentions is likely to find himself (or
herself, though perhaps less likely) being beaten about the head and
shoulders by many irate gentles.

The origin of the ban--as I've been told by thoes who were there and should 
know--is that at one of the very early events (second? third?), a young
woman decided she wanted to fight, too.  She was (apparently) a 
reasonably accomplished fencer.  A--reluctant--Henrik of Havn agreed
to fight her.  Shortly into the fight--he landed a solid blow.  The
woman burst into tears and complained that as she was a girl--he 
shouldn't have hit her . . .  (The logic escapes me as she should
have had a nodding acquaintence with what was going on by this time.)
This *one* incident created a lasting impression on a number of people.
I conjecture that had someone with a bit more fortitude tried it
first--the whole issue would never have come up.

More a case of reading a lot of the Victorian images of the Middle
Ages--Walter Scott and the like.  So far as I know the orginal
justification for "educational" was the necessity of recreating
combat techniques--as there weren't really any sources.  While Diana
majored in subjects related to the SCA period--nobody that I know did.
Siegfried's interest came from an interest in warfare, and took up
programming even while he was in the Air Force.  Richard of Mont-Royale
(who I tend to remember as Richard the Short), was a divinity student--
which is why we have Masters of Arms to this day.

Using the title to suit the occasion is reasonable.  It can also be
ambiguous.  In this (and the question of Duke of the <name of kingdom>,
which I'll get to in a moment) one can have problems.  How do you
deal with someone like Frederick of Holland?  When referring to him
as a member of the Order of Chivalry *or* the Order of the Pelican--
the appropriate honorific is "Master."  In addition--he is a Duke.
He's been King twice--once in the East and once in the West.  If anything,
he is a Duke of the SCA.

Now "Archduke" I take some exception to.  I consider it to be--as the
Heralds describe anything after 1485--late and decadent.  It was orginally
proposed for *one*person*--who at the time appeared to be the only
one ever likely to hold it.  Since then--the person it was proposed for
didn't make the qualification, but at least (and, I think, at most) two
others did.  Fortunately, by then, the title had disappeared into the
dust of SCA history . . .

For the West (unless I'm corrected by one of our Heralds who is more
up on it . . . Flieg?  Julstan?), it's only what's in the Corpora.
The only thing reserved are White belts, gold chains, spurs, laurel
wreaths, pelicans, and certain ornamentation on coronets--embattled,
pearls, strawberry leaves, etc.  No belts but white are reserved.
Red belts on squires are becoming more common, but I don't recall
seeing any other colors used for any given designation.  The red
is *not* reserved.

The are cloaks for new Laurels and Pelicans.  There is a stuffed
Pelican (with a bandaid on it's breast) for the new member of the 
order.  Pelicans tend to cry  "Scronk!" after the cheers.

Pied Argent for dancing comes to mind.  The Pegasus is a children's
award in the Mists.  Queen's Order of Grace. Princess's Order of Grace.
Defenders of the West.  Wooden Spoon--kingdom cooking.  Copper
Spoon--Mists, cooking.  Crock--kingdom brewing.  Ah!  Here's a couple
of old items--  The Mucking Great Clubbe--awarded periodically by the
current holder for ferocity (not sense, or skill, or any of the usual
virtues--just ferocity) on the field.  The Old Battered Helm for dying
well.  (The Clubbe was made out a chunk of hickory by Siegfried von
Hoefflichkeit for Ken de Maiff.  It looks about like a comic-book
cave man's club--though well waxed--weighs about 20 pounds and has
a large spike driven through the business end.  I have strong wrists,
but that monster is *heavy*.)  The list is probably endless--write a
letter to the Heralds of each kingdom--they should have lists . . .

In the West, any fighter "suitable to the Crown" may enter.  In practice
this means that the king is in for a fight if he wants to keep anybody
out.  At March Crown--the field had 80 fighters.  (At Mists Spring
Coronet, the field was 50.)

>	I have heard that only the West still has a three reigns per
>year custom, true or not? 

True.  But even our principalities have only two. (And we have 4 
Principalities.)  Crowns are in March, June, and October, with
Coroantions in May (Beltane), August and January (XIIth Night).

>	Now to do what appears in the Rialto to be called `flaming':

So far as I am concerned--"flaming" amounts to (and only to) an
injudiciuos ad hominem attack.  The most effective way to put out
such fires (in my experience) is to ignore the personal portion
and discuss the *ideas* involved.  Nothing seems to frustrate an
ardent flamer more than a lack of similar response.

>	To get back to persona, that isn't covered clearly in the rules,

I am quite content that they have not.  That is the crux of the
matter--so long as there is no consensus on this subject, it will
almost certainly be left out of the basic "law" of the Society.

If you feel that this is not the way things should be done, you can
(of course) try to build a consensus for making the change you desire.
If this does not set well--and you feel you can't be happy without
such a change--then by all means forma new organization that *does*
have such a rule.  (Conversely--if such a change is made and others
don't like it, they are--likewise--welcome to leave and start a new
organization.  This argument cuts both ways.)

>Right now there is discussion at that level on
>whether there should be an early period cut-off. I fervently hope they
>institute one- no matter what it is.

Again--I feel I must disagree.  In terms of what the Society does, any
early cut off is arbitrary.  The Arts and Sciences we practice changed
rather slowly of the period of our interest, so there is no particular
reason to change on that account.  The ideals of Chivalry grew over
a considerable period of time and have their roots farther back than
most of us use for our primarly period of interes.  On this account,
a trimming back of the *end* cut-off would make more sense.  A Roman
under the Principate would probaly have more in common with a Caroligian
than either would have with an Elizabethan.

>As the SCA changes and grows the 
>rules must change to deal with the current reality, and the reality is

I certainly don't know what other people are doing either--but I don't
consider this something to change--save by my learning more about it.
The SCA's great strength is that there is a framework solid enough to
permit interaction over great distances (look how far people travel
to get to Pennsic), without constraining everyone to be the same.  That
there is variety among the Laurel Kingdoms adds spice to the SCA--it
means that there are things to learn, strange customs to encounter,
new ways to consider growing all over the SCA.  And yet--I could move
thousands of miles and still fit in enough to recognize what is going
on and join in.  The closest model I've heard of for the SCA *is*
medieval Europe.  The kigdoms have a loose and general culture in 
common--just as the Middle Ages had Latin and the Church to hold them
together. Yet every kingdom has it's own local customs that are *just*
*enough* different to seem a little alien to a visitor.  Is that not
truly marvelous?  something to be cherished and preserved, not detroyed
in the name of conformity?

If you don't like the thought of doing this, you can also buy tapes that are
commercially sold, with running times of only a few minutes.

I'm a member of an English country dance group here, and it become obvious
some years ago, that several songs recorded on a regular tape, was a real
pain to deal with.  If we were doing a performance, we could have a special
performance tape, or if we had live musicians that knew the dances, we could
dance to their music.  However, these weren't always options.

So, we purchased a number of these shorter tapes, and life has been *so* much
better.  And, it doesn't require someone to splice the leaders on the tape, nor
to fix the raw tape to the hubs, nor to make sure that the person doing the
splicing is actually doing something that will last, as well as not gum up the
recorder's heads.  Although I've spliced a number of both open-reel and
cassette tapes, the thought of doing 40-50 cassettes was not very inviting.  Of
course, some people thrive on this type of thing, so ...

It was different this year, Lady Cher.  Trimaris had _plenty_ of time to
set up the shield wall, all the way at the far end of the beach.
(At least this time Meridies didn't have the OTHER end to walk from)
Meridies and Atlantia didn't have enough space at the front line to get

Now, if y'all would just take the middle of the beach next time :-)

 Markland does period weddings as it's members see fit to marry, most 
of these are for show since the "real" wedding was normal, there have been a

 There is nothing wrong with non-period protection for non-target 
zones, as long as it works, it can be covered with cloth or leather for

Here in Atlantia, I used to fight as a mercand after plastic became prevalent

In response to a number of messages discussing events and persons' saftey 
thereat:
  
I recall one Estrella War where we had a newbie get drunk AND pop a mess 
of funny pills, and then decide to go to his car and get his shotgun and 
start roaming around the Park...
One certain Duke saw this happen, quietly notified Security (we use radio 
headsets for this) and Security rounded up 2-3 local law-enforcement 
types that are local SCA, who rounded up several more reliable people, 
and the group converged on the Idiot before he had gotten 50 yards. 
He found himself staring into three badges and eight VERY large barrels
belonging to what may be euphemistically called "elven-weapons" stuck up
his nose.
He was escorted from the event, and had a RUDE Reality and Attitude 
Adjustment session.......
  
My kids have been raised in the SCA....after they had learned what the 
word "HOLD!" meant, we let 'em run fairly loose, because everyone watches 
out for everybody else.
  
Frankly, I'd rather be at an SCA event with my family than darn near 
anything else!

You are right there. I have fought in the Baronies of Storvik and Carolingia. 
Storvik was full of rhinohides who seemed to enjoy throwing blows that could 
take your head off, this was in 1982-1984. Carolingia, on the other hand, was 
vastly different. Fighters up there would thake anything that was a good solid 
blow, including hefty taps that came in clean (having not struck defensive 
gear) and threw reasonable blows that you could feel but not be in pain from. I 
was in Carolingia for the better part of 1984. Thank you.

Subject: Personna

I might as well enter the fray...
 
I've been in the SCA for eight years now, and when I started in the far reaches 
of the East Kingdom (Anglespur) everyone had a personna, and everybody played 
it...and I didn't run around trying to kill Germans and I didn't slit a lady's 
throat for calling the Pope the "whore of Babylon".  We were playing!  
Personnas were expected, but I don't think anyone had a "story".  I don't have 
a story, but I know the framework of my time.  To me, the knowledge needed to 
create a personna is needed, but that knowledge needs to be channeled to create 
your personna's personality.

I have since moved to a more "mainstream" area of the East, and the place is 
crawling with Germans who call themselves "von Halstern". 

 Because I do not know how much, or if, they play personna I hesitate 
to play my personna around them for fear of offense, so my personna is not what 
it used to be, and this saddens me.  Personnas where I am now are the 
exception, not the rule.

Do I "look down on" people without personnas?  Hell no!  My lady wife doesn't 
really have a personna, and neither does my knight. 

 My knight's lady, on the other hand, has a very well developed personna, 
and we have a great time insulting each other, and trying to show the other the 
error in their thinking ("fork...what is this!...to eat is why God gave you 
fingers!!")...this is part of the game, to me.  But I must say this;  why have 
a name, and arms etc. if it is nothing more than you in funny clothes.  Logic 
escapes.  I don't look at the SCA as a costume party.  I enjoy the characters 
and the viewpoints.  I enjoy talking to people about things my personna has no 
idea about.  I've never been an actor, so I don't think that is the "answer", 
but being my personna is something I enjoy...and their is a ddistiction.  I had 
one lady who wanted to sleep with my personna, and not me.
 
Yours in Service,
Pan Jan Janowicz Bogdanski

Subject: Spuds and mead

Greetings, all, from Ariel.

Just read Cariadoc's posting on "Wonders of the New World" feasts in period.
Note that I'm just speaking off the top of my head here, and that I'll have
to go home and check my books later... but it seems to me that such a feast
would have been prohibitively expensive, even for the well-heeled noble of
the time.  It's more likely that one or two dishes would be introduced as
special dishes (which would also heighten their "specialness" among the other
dishes there).  I'll check this question out for real later, though, as I
imagine Cariadoc will.

A lord posted a question about his mead, which was smelling sulfurous when
he opened a bottle during secondary ferment.  (Sorry, milord, I forget your
name.)  Anyway, it sounds like bad news to me.  The most likely reason why
your mead smells that way is because the bottle or the must was contaminated
before or during bottling.  (Are you sure that everything you used was
sterile?)  Another possibility is that some other organism got in and made
itself at home.  Again, sterile technique could have prevented that.

The recipe I use is one of Cariadoc's that I keep fooling with.  It's a
foolproof recipe when followed exactly, and I'll be happy to pass it along
if you'll contact me offline.

Speaking of offline, good gentles, is there a patient soul about who
wouldn't mind giving me a little instruction?  I've just started receiving
netnews (as opposed to the Digest), and the documentation for this program
is scanty at best.  Would some kind soul please help me figure out how to
do simple things?

Archers and other interested folks: Please note the new net address.  This
connection is reliable and should last at least a year (oh, thank the gods!).
Back from the high-tech hinterlands at last!

Subject: midrealm crowns, airplaning awkward objects, lady knights

The last (at least) two Midrealm Crown invite lists have gone
'All those who are by Letters Patent Peers of our Realm, and...
(hence follows a *long* list of names)'
I've understood this to be *any* Peer, not just Chivalry, having
an automatic invite.

Some years ago I traveled in the company of someone who had to
take their pace stick (essentialal 3 foot wooden dividers; has
various arcane military uses on a parade square) with them.  It
didn't fit anywhere, either, but the airline was willing to put
it somewhere for him, and it came back in that condition it
left in.  I have no idea where it got put, but you might ask
your airline...

As for 'lady knights' - to my thought, this comes smack under the
'middle ages as they should have been' ideal.  I am also told that
this was not altogether uncommon amoungst the southern (sicilian)
Normans, although I have not seen those sources myself.  Let not
be forgotten that fair knight Britomartis, either, lest her shade
or Spenser's come to haunt your sleep, a fate most decidely
unsettling! :]

There was a lady who requested information for nursing in the SCA.
I'm not familiar enough with Byzantine (her period) costume to
make a suggestion for that period, but I recall seeing a picture of
The Virgin Mary nursing Jesus in a Rennaisance gown with a lace up bodice
(unlaced) and a loose chemise (pulled down).

I hope this is of some assistance.

Re: customs

Actually, the general custom I've seen for Pelican proteges/esquires/eggs
is to wear a yellow belt, not a purple one. (Side note: this is *not*
reserved in any way, shape or form, dammit! Too many people are beginning
to treat belt colors as some sort of symbol of rank, and this should be
discouraged. At a recent event, one friend of mine was asked what his *blue*
belt signified! (It signified that he needed something to hold his belt pouch
on...) Let's not have rigid laws evolving where they aren't needed...)

Which leads me into...


Re: defining the "rules"

I have to disagree with Arastorm quite strongly on this point: I'd much
prefer that the BoD stay far away from defining the "rules" that the
Society exists under. The "rules" vary widely, from region to region and
person to person -- if there isn't any real agreement on what game we
are supposed to be playing in general, then how can we codify this into
hard-and-fast rules? If the BoD sets down these restrictions, they will
merely limit the Society, since almost any rule will contradict common
practice *somewhere*.

Here's a dare, based on a discussion I had with Master Steffan some time
ago. (I may have brought this subject up before, but I don't think it got
much response.) Freemasonry has a small number of these rules, which are
known as the "landmarks". They define the necessities of Masonry -- any
Lodge that violates a Landmark is, by definition, not Masonic. Now, the
Landmarks are *very* vague, and even these vague rules aren't universally
agreed upon -- there are maybe ten of them that every Grand Lodge pretty
much agrees are right.

Now, I dare this group to define the Landmarks of the Society. What are
the things that unquestionably define the SCA? Steffan and I have argued
this point for a number of hours on various occasions, and haven't come
up with *one* yet, that is really a) universally agreed upon, and b)
worthy of being a Landmark. (The latter basically says that there are
many things that are common practice for all kingdoms, but which don't
really define the Society. For example, all Kingdoms choose their Kings
by tournament combat, but I don't believe that it would fundamentally
change things if a Kingdom chose to do otherwise.) I argue that the SCA
is simply too diverse an organization to have landmarks more concrete
than "dedicated to recreation of the culture of days of yore". I also
argue that this is one of the strengths of the SCA -- its diversity is
endlessly fascinating.

I would love to get a spirited debate going on this subject. I really
doubt that we can codify any useful landmarks here, but it's a worthwhile
exercise -- if we succeed, the results could be quite useful...

Subject: things people wear

This discusion of 'things worn under armor' reminds me of an incident
that took place at Ealdormere Coronet; a certain gentle, who possesses
a tunic most wondrously printed (on white, thankfully) of small green
beasties somewhat like dragons (they're beaked, and HRM Ariake insists
that this makes them tygers, or at least the descendants of tygers
even if they have wings!)

During the afternoon, His Majesty called an assembly of the Order of
the Laurel in EAldormere, for the purpose of granting a boon they
had collectively begged of him.  (much 'what!'ing and scratching of
heads as everyone tried to decide who could possibly be *that* due
for a Laurel!)  The tunic was subsequently banished.  Not the gentle,
just the tunic.

During the Midrealm court that evening, HSH David attempted to plead
for the tunic, as it was indeed of a resonable weave and block printed
with what appeared to be the heraldic totem animal of the Middle.
It was at this point that Her Majesty made her point about beaks, and
His Majesty declared that it was perfectly all right for the tunic to
be worn in the East, where it so clearly belonged.  :] ( <- for HRM's
presumed intent, the smiley!)

Me, I wear a field grey tunic, no trim... safer that way... :]

Well, maybe that's a little extreme...

Countess Arastorm's coments on wishing the BoD would codify persona,
and several other things, more concretely hit something of a nerve;
*this isn't an objective driven grouping*.  What we're trying to do
wasn't defined when we started and thus includes whatever anyone's
managed to throw in that most of those around them like.

It would be a shame to insist that everyone write sonnets; rhime royal
may grate to your hearing, but it was a labour of love for they as
wrote it, and some of the blood clanging in alliterative verse was
sweated by the poet.  Stop your ears, if needs you must, but it is
a dull thing to only tramp one round of dances.

Subject: another option for Pennsic food

I've read with great interest the postings on eating at Pennsic.
But for anyone who's going for the first time, there is one more
bit of information they may want to know: there is another way.
Unlike many camping events or standard campgrounds, Pennsic has
*restaurants*.  Last Pennsic there was a wonderful middle eastern
establishment which had great food for reasonable prices.  There
were also other worthy establishments purveying things like meat
pies, roasted chicken, and even breakfast!  Additionally, there
is the Coopers' store, with lots of mundane supplies: ice, milk,
fruit, sandwiches (tho with the interesting food available, why
bother?), and some camping and personal supplies.
Last Pennsic, (my third), there was no cooking at Baroness Megan's
encampment.  The Baroness isn't interested in spending her time
cooking, and Claus the Toymaker spent his time making toys and
dealing with his apprentice, Geimle.  Then there was me --
I was with child and in no mood to cook either.  For breakfast
we usually bought donuts and milk from the aforementioned
store (or occasionally splurged for breakfast at a food merchants).
Lunch was quite often brought to us -- there are also roving food
merchants in the merchants area (as I understand it they are not
allowed to sell their food elsewhere).  Dinner was at one of the
fine dining establishments - last war, usually the middle eastern
merchants (who, BTW, run a middle eastern restaurant mundanely
in town, which may account for the high quality of their food.  Wihd
(that is, Wish) I could remember their name!).
Anyway, there is quite a variety of food options available at
Pennsic, if you can afford them.  If money is tight, you may opt
to eat very simply in the day and then enjoy a good dinner at a
food merchant.  This is a decent compromise, and keeps expenses
down.

Subject: Personal Safety in SCA Camps

I cannot personally speak about relative safety at Pennsic--I've never
been there (alas!).  I *can* speak to my experience.

The worst "incident" that I've ever heard of amounts to 'date rape'.
While this is not something to be condoned--I think the description
of "post coitus regrets" probably comes close to the situation.
I tend to feel that if enough alcohol is consumed--this sort of thing
*will* happen from time to time.  the real solution--don't drink to
excess.

For situations where drunkeness doesn't enter into the equation, my
experience is that SCA camps are one of the safest places to be.
To put this in perspective, let me note that I have a teenage daughter
who is taking up bellydancing.  My wife and I can retire in the evening
without worrying about where our daughter is or that she is likely to
come to harm.

Subject: SCA publications, & what do members get?

Gentles of the Rialto, Greetings!

A fisher answered my recent query about armour and weapons by suggesting
I acquire a copy of _The Hammer_. I presume that this is some SCA published
periodical or booklet. Could anyone tell me how to find out about it and any
other services or publications the SCA provide?

Are these publications only available to SCA members, or may 'Ioseph Publicke'
also buy?

I am trying to find out what benefits I could get from membership, even if I
can't socialize regularly (The 'local' shires are both based about a 2.5
hour's drive away. Too far for evening sessions, but maybe OK for a full day
or weekend).

The same gentle mentioned the Stock Clerk as the source of 'The Hammer',
so I assume this is the person who acts as a source of all SCA literature.
Is there an email address to contact the SCA offices? (I'd be surprised if
there was, but it's worth asking). It's frustrating waiting for snail-mail
after you've tried elecktrickery!

Thank you,

      Jim Deakin.

1990]

This posting is intended to allay the fears of those who are new to 
the SCA--particularly those whose only contact so far has been through 
an electronic network.  On these networks, much of the material 
presented consists of folk with years of experience in the SCA 
discussing fine points and obscure details of subjects they are 
familiar with.  None of it represents--unless otherwise stated--any 
form of official SCA policy or publication.  What one reads in such 
places can be rather daunting.

To get a better perspective on what SCA folk are like when they meet, 
there is no substitute for going to SCA meetings and events.  Meetings 
tend to be less formal, so if you are *very* unsure of yourself--that 
may be an easier place to start.  Events tend to be more formal (SCA 
practice requires that people be attired in "some attempt at" pre-1650 
clothing--note the word "attempt") and more structured.  They also--in 
many cases--have a formal way to help those new to the organization.

In these media we see periodic requests for help in finding out what 
the SCA is, and/or how to get in contact with an SCA branch near the 
poster or the person the posting put up for.  In brief--this is a way 
to do so--

If you post--there are those here that will supply as much information 
that they have at hand to get you started.  What we *need* is to know 
the modern location you want for the contact information as SCA 
branches are determined by geography.  We're not asking for a mailing 
address--which you may be hesitant to supply--just city and state 
(and/or country, when outside the USA, though most of us can probably 
identify and locate Canadian provinces without real difficulty).

The most general contact is the SCA Office of the Registry.  if you 
write a letter to the Registry inquiring about the SCA, they will send 
you some general information, plus a copy of the newsletter for the 
major branch (kingdom) that your mailing address puts you in.  
Newsletters contain lists of branches--with both internal and external 
names and locations--and contact information at the kingdom, 
principality, and local branch levels.  The Registry address is--

If we can determine what kingdom you are in from a posting, you will 
probably get mail back giving reasonably current information on your 
kingdom Senescahl--the "CEO", as it were, for the region you live in.  
A letter or phone call to that person should get you a local contact.

If you are the same kingdom as the person replying to you, you will 
probably get local contact information in the mail you get back--and,
most likely--an invitation to come to local events and meetings.  
(We're really a gregarious and friendly lot.)

If there are remaining questions--write back (or post) and one or more 
of us will try to find answers or put you in touch with someone who 
*can* find the answer.  There is--like most newsgroups--a lot of 
collective wisdom here.

You will also see debates and comments relating to "members" and "non-
members".  There is no requirement for *anyone* to become a member of 
the SCA (in the formal sense) in order to go to SCA events.  Indeed--
it is frequently suggested that newcomers go to an event or two before 
even *considering* formally joing the SCA.  We would far rather hav 
some be able to say--"They're nice folk, but it wasn't for me", that 
to have them say--"They're just out for your money . . ."  The 
benefits of membership are relatively few--but for some it's 
important.  It saves time filling out paperwork at events.  It helps 
pay for the overhead expenses of the organization.  It gets you word 
on when and where events are being held.  It gets you research that 
has been done by other in the SCA.  It may add a feeling of belonging.

If you feel intimidated by what you see in this forum--please bear in 
mind that the SCA has always had a steady influx of new--and 
frequently bewildered--people.  We have created institutions to help 
new people and we have folk who's job within the SCA is specifically 
to help those who are new.  We were all new to the SCA once . . . and 
we owe it to those who follow to help as we were helped.

You can call Seneschals.  You can call other officers.  Those names,. 
addresses and phone numbers are printed in the newsletters to be used.  
The folk behind those numbers are just the same as you are.  They're 
there to help.  The only thing we ask is a little consideration--call 
at a reasonable hour.  (The society--as was once noted in a student 
Anthro paper--is a *part*time* society.  Most of use work for living.)

If all else fails--send e-mail to some of us on a network, explain 
your problem and we'll see what we can do to solve it and make you at 
ease within the SCA.

Subject: Hot pink garb and dragons on skateboards

      Apropos hot pink garb, Therion Calgate (hzs@psu.edu) suggests
finding some gentle way of correcting such failures of taste -- Say,
burning at the stake. :-)
      While I must admit the idea has some appeal, it might be a little
extreme.  A milder alternative was demonstrated recently in Ealdormere:

      At a certain royal progress event, the assembled Order of the Laurel
approached Their Majesties with a request.  "If it is a right and proper
thing, etc." said Their Majesties, whereupon a certain individual was
called to the front -- I'll call him "John", to protect the innoc..., well,
whoever.
      When John reached the royal presence, there was much moaning and
averting-of-eyes among the Laurels, for, you see, John was wearing a T-tunic
made from white cotton printed with bright green dragons riding skateboards.
Their Majesties immediately agreed that this was a matter of great seriousness
requiring immediate action.
      Upon a brief consultation, the Royal decree was that John must
cease to offend the Royal presence with this garb, and remove it.  However,
'twould be unseemly to have a man go naked from Their court.  So, since it
was the Laurels who had registered the complaint, they were charged with
procuring some acceptable covering for John-of-the-Little-Green-Dragons.
They promptly produced a dark rough-woven T-tunic for the man, and the
offending item was whisked away to who-knows-where.  John was now clothed
acceptably, the Laurels could now enjoy their supper, and Their Majesties
had demonstrated to the populace both Their justice and Their mercy.

      Lest any should think ill of them, the Laurellate in Ealdormere do
not usually take on the role of Authenticity Police.  When we asked one of
the Laurels about this afterwards, he looked very pained and said, somewhat
apologetically:
      "But he's been wearing that thing for *months*!"

Subject: Various: SCA pubs, dance tapes, MK Crown List

In response to a few things from Arastorm's postings of 4/29 and 4/30:

I agree that at least Kingdoms should appoint someone to collect the SCA
pubs, and then buy subscriptions to them.  Even though the "freebies"
are nice, I remember reading them thoroughly only for a few months as
Queen, then just piling them up for the next 3 yrs. as Kingdom Seneschal.
I had a few interested friends who scanned through them for me and
pointed out things of interest, but there was just too much information
and too little time to devote to it.

Re: dance tapes -- Amanda mentioned Master Aiden's individual tapes --
actually he had those specially made up as 5 minute tapes, ordered in
bulk of 200 or so.  I think they just came with the screws in them already,
probably because the company had to specially make them.  But still a
great idea!!  I have since been transferring all my dance tapes to this
format as well.  You can also make up special tapes for use at demos,
such as Branles with only one repeat or shorter length galliards and
pavanes, etc.  Very handy!  I think the individual dance tape system
has been used in the Barony of Shattered Crystal (Belleville, IL) very
successfully for a while now, also.

Re: Middle Kingdom Crown Lists
The Chivalry (Knights & Masters) are automatically invited, but must
reserve (in writing) by whatever deadline the Tanist sets.  The Chivalry
and other Peers of the Realm are asked to recommend un-belted fighters
to the Tanist; the Tanist draws up the rest of the list from these
recommendations and whomever else Their Highnesses deem worthy to participate.
The list of un-belted fighters invited to Crown is published in The Pale
(hopefully) a month before the Tourney.  The amount of people invited may
vary from reign to reign, but the Crown List is invitational.

Happy AS XXV!

My readings agree with that of David James.  Tournaments were important on
several levels:

1) They were important to the knight:
   Tournaments were of course an important way of gaining both experience
   and fame.  They were also however at least a major contributor to the 
   income of a sucessful knight - perhaps THE major contributor.  Being a 
   knight was very expensive - in fact in the latter middle ages many Squires
   elected to remain Squires due to the expense involved in maintaining
   knighthood.  During peacetime, booty could be hard to come by - what with
   the Pope and his 'Peace of God' and 'Truce of God' declarations.  Not only
   was the Church saying WHEN you could fight, but also WHO.  Now if you happen
   to have large estates to support you, all's well and good,  But if not you
   needed booty.  I note that 'booty' is not the dirty word it is today, but
   fair gains by right of conquest.  You might even be the son of a wealthy
   landowner, but if you were not the eldest son, you were SOL.  Primogeniture
   was common in many areas. "Where primogeniture was the rule, younger sons
   had to leave home to find a livelihood either in the Church or by the sword".
   -- Frances Gies; "The Knight in History".

   There is a tale about William Marshal which I extract here from
"The Knight in History" by Frances Gies:

  'At a feast that night celebrating the victory, a knight commented on
William's performance: William, he said, had fought to deliver the town rather
than to take prisoners for ransom or to seize horses and equipment.  He had 
behaved, in other words, like the ideal rather than the real knight. 
Such behavior was admired, but only to a point.  The earl of Essex reminded 
William that a knight could not afford to disdain booty.  "Marshal" he said,
"give me a gift, for love and for recompense."  "Surely," agreed William,
"what?"  "A crupper, or a horse collar."  "But God bless me, I have never owned
one in my whole life."  "Marshal, what are you saying? Today you had forty or
sixty, before my own eyes!  Will you refuse me?"  The assembled company burst
out laughing.'

  William learned.  After leaving the tournament poorer than he had came,
despite his victories, he never failed to obtain prisoners and equipment again.
Money was not only important for your own expenses but also to pay any
imprisoned teammates (ie. If you could not pay your own ransom, then 
friends/family/teammates were obliged too.  Another extract from the same
source reveals: 'William's biographers record how at dinner during one 
tournament William caught sight of a knight of the opposing party who had
fallen in the street and broken his leg.  William "rushed outside, ran to the
groaning knight, took him in his arms, armor and all, and carried him into 
the inn," not to succor him, but to present him for ransom to his dinner
companions with the words: "Here, take him to pay your debts!"'

2) They were important to the King/Pope:
  During wartime knights were a blessing.  During peacetime however...
  The very reason the the 'Truce of God' and 'Peace of God' declarations
  were in existence was due to maurading knights.  Tournaments allowed them
  to kept a well trained elite force active while not having internal
  wars and skirmishes tear their holdings apart.

3) They were important to the economy:
  This is an assumption on my part, but it seems to me a reasonable one.
  I have seen paintings which show many specators and my text sources support
  the idea that tournaments were very much a spectator sport.  They were as 
  Vissevald Selkirksson noted, held in large areas using towns/cities
  as their boundaries.  There was a great deal of pageantry involved,
  especially in later years when special effects such as exploding shields
  were used in jousts.  Pageantry and spectators spell MONEY, or if you
  perfer TRADE.  It would be interesting to find out the effects of
  tournaments on the 'boundary towns' local economy.

I would say that "Was Chivalry?" Of course!!
but "Was Chivalry what we think it was?" Probably NOT!
In this I think that we are giving ourselves 'a very bad lesson in
what chivaly was or wasn't'.

I already mentioned the importantance of 'booty' to a knight.  In addition
it was not considered unchivalrious for several knights to gang-up on a
single knight during a tournament.  However there is YET ANOTHER TALE
of William Marshall coming across a monk eloping with a woman.  When William
found out that the monk had some money which he was planning on loaning out
and live off the interest, William was shocked - he ordered his squire to
seize the money, and shared it with his two friends.  These actions may
not be what many people in the SCA would see as being chivalrous, however
William Marshall was considered to be a knight of the highest degree.

What was important is that they held fast to the ideals of their day, not
that their ideals coincided with ours!

Subject: dance tapes

In the "dark ages" of personal computing, systems such as the Apple ][ and the
TRS-80 (not to forget the Commodore 64!) used cassette tape for program
storage.  Most of the manufacturers made 5-minute per side cassettes for this
use.  I cannot vouch for the audio quality of said tape, but if it was
sensitive enough for digital data storage (in analog form), then it should be
good enough for dance music. This does mean you need a much larger box to carry
your dance tapes around in, but it also means you don't spend anytime at all
looking for a particular dance, if you label the tapes.

All official SCA publications are available from the Stock Clerk, who
can be contacted via the Registry.  That address was just posted.  

A standard membership provides 1 monthly Kingdom newsletter, which
contains announcements of events in that area and assorted other
articles and information, and the quarterly SCA-wide magazine,
"Tournaments Illuminated," which contains articles on the whole range
of SCA activites.  For additional cost, one can receive more than one
kingdom newsletter, the minutes of Board of Directors' meetings, or
"Compeat Anachronist," which is a series of pamphlets, each addressing
a single topic of SCA interest in some depth.

The SCA does offer subscriptions to newsletters without membership,
or at least, it used to do so.  There were "library subscriptions".  I
think they provides TI without a kingdom newsletter, but I'm not sure.

Greetings unto the rialto, from Margrethe von Holbeck!

Therion Calgate of the Mountain Confederation writes that we should
burn at the stake the gentle who was wearing hot pink clothing.
We, being gentle ladies of the Clothier's guild, will do no such thing.
However, if we find him again, we have made plans to publicly dye him-
which should (ahem) kill all such attempts by fighters to win the day
by nauseating their opponents.

In addition, we have made plans to publicly commend those gentles we find
wearing garb that looks like *clothing*- as opposed to garb that looks
like slightly sturdier halloween costumes.  I see this as a (dare
I say kinder and gentler?) positive way to encourage personae as
well as clothiery- and perhaps that is what Arastom, too, wishes to
encourage.

     My dim recollection of the arthurian romances has a lady wearing a

There was one knight in the story who found it objectionable.
     Women warriors, known or disguised as men, are another story much

Good, learned, wise and knowledgeable Gentles of the Rialto:
 
As a parent of 2 small children, I am becoming increasingly aware of the
pleasures and problems of bringing children to events. Bit by painful bit we
are re-creating ways that young Oswin, Kyla and I can all enjoy events rather
than dread them, but I have a feeling that we are re-inventing a great many
wheels.
 
Does any of you know of a gentle being or two out there that has compiled a
wealth of kinder-info as it relates to the society? I'd just love a compendium
of ideas, a newsletter, a list of hints, or anything. For example, I understand
that Caid has the Silver Crescents, but I'm not sure who's running it or whom
to contact. Also, I have the Page's Handbook but it's more suited to ages about
8 and up, and it'll be awhile before my two get close to that.
 
I appreciate any information you may be able to send. Again, our receipt of the
digest is occasionally screwy (we're working on figuring out why) so if you
could post directly to me (expotech@applelink.apple.com) as well as to the
Rialto, it would be most appreciated.

Several people have remarked upon "new member grabbing".  I wish I had been
grabbed three years ago.  If I had been associated with one of the households
in my then barony, I might have been able to get more involved.  Sigh.
Alas, I did not how one got into a household, or whether it was appropriate
for me to approach the household, or wait for them to approach me, or how
to meet anyone.  I was a little shy then.  I doubt that a new member will
allow themselves to be grabbed if they do not wish to be...
Ah well, all this is in the past, now I grab new members...none have objected
so far!

Someone (I've forgotten who) requested dance tapes that announced what sort
of dance followed the announcement.  the Rose and Nefr press publish a
dance manual which I like very much which comes with two dance tapes.
Each tape is not only organized according to which type of dance, but
a voice comes on before each dance and announces the name of the dance.
I like them, but I warn you, the sound qualitiy is not the best.

Subject: Re: another option for Pennsic food

On the subject of Pennsic food, the following has been our strategy
for some years.

I. Bring lots of period nibbles. That includes ready-to-eat things
that keep made from period recipes (hais, hulwa, khushkhanaj, current
cakes (actually 17th c.), etc.) and also bought things that are
ready-to-eat and were eaten in period (bread, cheese, sausage, dried
fruit, some fresh fruit). One can live pretty well on a selection of
the above.

II. During the nine days we are at Pennsic, we cook one or two
dinners and invite the encampment to share. These are period meals
that use ingredients that keep and are not a lot of work. There is no
particular reason why period dishes should be any more work than out
of period ones, and we have a very large base of period recipes to
select from. The real work is in cooking anything and cleaning up
afterwards. Doing a cooked meal every day would eat up too much of
our time.

III. Two or three other people or couples in the encampment do II, so
we we end up with cooked meals about every other day.

IV. When bored with I and II or III is not available, eat at one of
the restaurants. 

This year we will have an infant with us, as will Dain and Euthemia,
so Allah alone knows how things will work out.

I forgot V. Give a class on something concerning cooking or al-Islam,
and have Joshua ibn-Eleazar show up and feed me yummy rampart bread
from his translation of the Andalusian cookbook. also

VI. Get invited out to dinner at least once. and

VII. Go into the Coopers' store to drink a diet coke and eat an
icecream sandwich. The Coopers' store is my personal disenchanted
ground--the one place at Pennsic where I assume I am being out of
persona.

Subject: new member grabbing

I'd like to combine two recent topics into one: the phenomenal
growth of the SCA (75% are new members and more coming fast) and
the "horrible" fault that some people grab new members for their
households.
In my experience- (and may I say that when I mention my years in
the SCA *I* still feel like a new member next to Flieg and others
I have met {and acted dopey around because I was so impressed})-
the "villians" who  "grab" new members are not villians at all,
they are people who have a sence of noblesse oblige, who feel a
responsibility to help new members, who give a heck of a lot more
than they get.
This is not to say that they don't get a lot. A household with 
many people (if it is well organised) can accomplish minor miracles.
They present a display which is a decoration to all events they 
attend, and a source of labor their barony probably uses.

But more importantly, the new members are taught that which they
need to learn, they have introductions made, they always  have
someone that they can ask questions of, and even in their first
events have a sense of *belonging*.
Have the detractors of these `Body grabbers' ever asked the
new members about their experience? It is far more positive than
those of the waifs who float about looking on, but are not really
participating, find a spare seat on board, but are not drawn into 
the conversation, want desperatly to find a lord or lady to 
whom they can give homage and so to be a part of this wonderful
dream- but don't dare to ask. If there are problems, it is usually 
at a much later date than the first year or so, and I've never heard
of a household that wouldn't let a member go.

We've all heard the joke:`What's the difference between a new member
and a member of Clan Creachain...the Dark Horde...Crak al Farangi...
whatever...?  About five minutes.' However, the senario is usually that a 
new member chats with a member of the house who extolls it's virtues
and advantages, then the new member makes overtures, and the house
member brings him to the Lord who probably invites him in. 
Sinister? Hardly. I have spent a great deal of time trying to figure
out what people have against it.
I would like to hear from those who do. (and not well, it's good for 
us but not for *them*)
Considering the large influx of new members, I think it behooves
the rest of us to start imitating these Lords and Ladies. Go out 
there and offer new members the hospitality of your household. Take
them in and help them with their garb, and devices, (and personae),
and entrance to guilds. When they have been in awhile, they may
create their own households, or stay with yours, or become King. 
But right now our problem is that a lot of people are joining 
the SCA and they need help. If you aren't part of the solution....

Subject: diverse topics

Thank you for the wonderful description of Horic and Lea's
last court.
If folks from other kingdoms also have done wonderful "shtick"
I, at least, would love to read about it.

On women fighting- my memory is that several fought at Pennsic
One, but about the time of Pennsic Three, the question arose
on whether it was reasonable. The argument most often used was
that as a lord could not possibly strike a lady, he must forfeit
every match where he meets one in the lists, and since this is
not chivalrous on her part, she should not be allowed to do it.
Many ladies then did take male persona. Others fought on the 
side- fighting practices, etc. waiting for the issue to be
resolved. There was much discussion of medieval women fighters.
(In the Berseark camp, every historical example was declaired to
be an exception.) My clearest memory of the whole period (which 
only lasted about two or three years, and then women were fighting
again) was of Joanna Dudley. She traveled an hour each way to the
only man who was willing to train her. And he insisted that {since
generally ladies get discouraged, and he didn't want to waste his
time on someone who wasn't motivated} she never remove her helmet
until the fighting practice was over. The men at the same practice
were allowed to take theirs off, but not Joanna. For over a year
she had a rash on her face from these long periods with sweaty foam
rubbing against her skin. As far as I know, not one knight or anyone
who could have influenced him called her trainer out on this. He
was considered generous to allow her to practice at all. Remember
this when people (even I) about the "good old days" in the early SCA.

If Dan Briggs can find jugglers, fire eaters, magicians, knife 
throwers, acrobats, etc. I know a LOT of autocrats who would like
his contact list. Good Luck! (and stay in touch)

On mead- what the heck, I've given this recipe to everyone else-
Stormbrew-  5 gallons of water
	    10 pounds of honey
	    juice of one lemon
          two whole cinnamon sticks
          two whole nutmeg
          6-8 whole cloves
          2 tbsp or pkt. Fleishman's yeast
I know that this is not a "real" mead recipe. But it has been
very popular with feasters for around fifteen years now.
     Boil the honey and water in a non-ferrous pot (or it will 
turn black and disgusting). Stir the honey until it is disolved.
(Someone once called from California to ask why the honey appeared
to be burning on the bottom, but the water had been boiling for
two hours) Skim of the scum that comes to the top. (a tempura
skimmers works beautifully for this) During the boiling add the lemon
and spices- (you can stick the spices in the squeezed lemon rind and
throw that in or in a *clean* sock). Let it cool when no more scum 
forms. When it is warm not hot, transfer it to barrel or carboy and
add the yeast. Close with a fermentation lock, and wait. Generally
I brew ten days before the event in Summer, twenty in winter, and
between between. If you bottle it the day before, it becomes nicely
carbonated, and it's easier to chill it for supper in bottles.
 Actually, I have been trying quick batches at the war. This "one
day mead" has been quite well recieved. Same recipe, but in one
gallon batches, made up after supper, is ready they next day. It's
weak, but the kids like it.

	Tangentally, I have had a problem with both by brewing and
cooking for feasts that I would really like to experiment more, but
the guests want to have the same thing. "Everyone" knows what an
"Arastorm Feast" is, and they want to be able to depend on it. The
same with Stormbrew, so I only get to experiment in small batches
at home. Do other autocrat types out there have the same problem?

	As a general rule I use two pounds of honey per gallon for
quick mead-(and if it's to be drunk immediately have committed the
heresy of using baking yeast), but for anything laid down for six
months or more I use four or five pounds of honey, more for longer
workings (and definately use mead or champagne yeast!)

On "Annual events"- Long, long ago (long enough that some may not
care) someone tried to have an event in late June. "You can't *do*
that! That's *our* weekend!" cried the Autocrat of Coill Ohrda's
annual event. [It is now odd to think that once there were no more 
than one event per weekend per kingdom isn't it?] So I looked up
all the calendars in Pikestaff back to Triumph and discovered that
it wasn't always the same weekend. Another tidbit I discovered was
that Pennsic 1 was the 3rd weekend in September, II the 2nd, III the
first, IV the last weekend in August, V the next to last weekend in
August... It's a good thing they made that agreement with the Coopers
or we'd be fighting in Spring thaw in a few years! At that point the
Yearwheel started coming out. Yearwheel carried all announced events
Plus (in different typeface) the traditional events. This allowed
autocrats warning about who would probably be planning their baronial
birthday party, or other traditional event plenty of time. There 
were indeed seneschals who told me that they had forgotten about it
until they saw it in the Yearwheel. 
	However.  
I am a bit ambivelent about long weekends. There are only so many 3
day weekends available a year and they are the best time for big
{especially camping} events. When one group stakes a claim on one
of these weekends for an annual event it is lost to all other groups
forever. This simply may be free market, but I *like* big events.
I'd rather be camping with 400 people than 200, and 200 two states 
states away. Perhaps all 3 day weekends should belong to the Kingdom
to be granted like Crown, coronations and 12th nights. Then all 
groups could have a chance at the big money makers- and one group
wouldn't be stuck with the massive organization problem every year.
Comments?

Also thank everyone for their comments on personas. I am loving 
every word of it! I am getting the impression that originally the
SCA wasn't based on the European Medieval History, but rather on some
Jungian archetype of the Middle Ages "as it should have been", and
people were just modeling the SCA (and themselves) on this chivalrous
archetype. (Again a guess) it was when the SCA incorporated and 
needed to claim that it was educational that the real "history" aspect
was added. (Of course, that doesn't fly since according to the story
Diana Paxton was a student of the period, and presumably so were
many of the other founders.) Of course, while accepting the basic
dichotomy that the SCA requires of many of us skills and practices
at odds with our historical personae, I think that a historically
based persona is preferable.

Justin! You forgot Carolingian Masked Ball (first weekend in December
high lighted by a mumming and followed the next day with the Bridge
birthday) Sigh! When Masked ball can be forgotten, were is the glory?
Are events truely so existential? |-* Sigh! Has anyone even kept
track of who is ahead in the Pennsic Wars? How soon we forget! (what
about the event 0stgardr used to have at the Cloisters every August?
I feel so OLD!

I think that Henry of Linlithgow should not only keep a listing of
all SCA magazines, I think the SCA should pay for it. Having done
some newsletter or other for over half my time in the SCA I have
developed quite an attitude problem about people who think they
should get free copies of newsletters- one to the Crown, one to the
Cronicler, another to the Seneschal, more to Prince and regional
offficers, the historian... Great. Most small newsletters are run
at cost- before these freebies, or exchanges (which I think really
help boost quality). This means about $5 a month coming out of the
pockets of the editors.
No one knows better than I the cost of being on the throne (ten years
ago it cost us $5K and I think it's up to $15 now if the Crown
travels a reasonable amount) and I assume similar high costs for 
officers, but remember, a free subscription is a unpaid for sub-
scription. Take the cost of the sub. and multiply by the freebies. I
think that's too much for various editors to absorb. Rather the SCA
corporate office should fun one collector and leave it at that. I 
also assume that this common collector would index all articles by
subject and author and make this index available to the populous
through the Stock clerk. This would not only include newsletters,
artsletters and magazines, but various pamplets. It would be a 
great service for anyone researching anything- not to mention the 
history value and ability to see what a given author has generated.

I personally, dislike multiple titles- except on scrolls where it
adds flavor (try some garlic or cumin?). When speaking on Dance,
it is Master Patri, on Chilvary it is Sir Patri, when on his demnesine
is is Baron Patri. Let's not be rediculous. And in scrolls, how about
using the full title Master of the Laurel, Master of Arms of the West,
Duke of the West, Viscount Mists, Baron of the Court, Companion of the
assorted other awards, then Prefered Title Name. ( I think that Arch
Duke sounds fine, it's no sillier than our other usages.)

I don't know about atavists- but I remember a "ladies of knights"
meeting where the consensis was that the two biggest problems was
getting the knight to wear something other than his favorite tunic
(the answer was make him several duplicates of it) and squires
either moving in on you or dropping in to eat all the time. Just
because we don't toss guests out on their ears, Balian, doesn't 
make us all atavists. Three cheers for modern plumbing!

Forgive the length- I got to 6 digests at once.

Subject: dance tapes

To those marvelous gentles who make dance tapes for the SCA,
whether live or assembled from previous recordings, 
a thought:
	When assembling your various dances, pray remeber how
the tape will be used- it would be a great boon to the
dancers to cluster the dances by form: circle dances, line
dances, groups of four then six etc.. Perhaps at the start of each
of these groups the dance master could say *on the tape*:
"Hereafter come four line dances, couples face the head of the 
hall", after these he says: "couples face your partner for the
next two dances". Then, could you find a line dance to lead
the line into a circle, then have the circle dances, etc. ?
THink of how much less dashing back and forth to the machine
for the dancemaster, and how much less reorganisation during
the dances! If you are putting the tape together yourself, 
it is in your control.
	If this has already been done, please tell me where I
can obtain copies.  Many thanks. =Arastorm

Subject: don't tell me what game to play?

Well, this persona discussion seems to be winding down. As far
as I can tell there are a few general points of consensus:

 Both those who do and those who don't want to employ personae 
use many different definitions to define what they do.
 I am fondest of Cariadoc's specifying having a Persona and/or
having a Persona story as a fairly clear and simple distinction.
 I also like Megan's differentiation between SCA persona and 
historical persona, which I quoted in an earlier posting.
 It also appears that too many people with SCA personae
(as per Megan's distinction)
have had unpleasant run-ins with people who tell them that they
should have persona. (Presumably they meant persona stories or
historical persona. I would be interested to know which.)
Finally, there are some people who insist that they do not have 
persona at all.
 Another general consensus seems to be that `Arastorm is provincial
and probably a trifle innocent'. True. It was only last month that
I learned that outside New England everyone doesn't have town meetings
(my mind boggled). But, I am too cracked to be close minded. Tell
me more. ("More, more, I'm still not satisfied!") 
	What are the sumptuary laws in your kingdoms? (I won't be
happy until I have heard from every kingdom.) I remember that at least
for a while the Middle had laws defining the dimensions for banners.
I seem to remember Atenvelt laws on how broad metallic bands people of
various ranks could wear. [I was asked by an Atenveldter I met at 
Pennsic once `if you couldn't tell by their headgear what their
rank was, how could you know how to treat them?' I responded that in 
the East, if you act like a lady or gentleman, you'll be treated as
one, and if not, not. The gentle fairly ran away as if the devil had
appeared to her.] Since we do jewelry we've always wanted a full
list of Known World Sumptuary Laws, but apparently it's never been 
assembled. (Maybe because it keeps changing?)
	What ceremonies do you have? I've seen Middle Kingdom Pelicans
"flapping their wings" but in the East the big ceremonies seem to be
reserved for knights (although there is a mantle for a new Laurel 
now- that's nice). And I have watched knightings ranging from dubbing with
a sword to knocking the new knight off his feet with a accolade by fist.
I've also heard of the Eastern King mailing a sword to Drachenwald
which he had "invested" in some way with his authority so that someone
else could knight the candidate by proxy- but I'm not sure if this is
a rumor or not.
	What awards do you have? Some of the interesting ones in the
East are the Terpsichore for teaching dance, and the Burdened Tyger
for cooking or autocratting an exceptional event (either it was 
exceptionally good, or it was good despite exceptionally adverse 
conditions).  Of course, there is always a great deal of discussion
among the polling orders about just what their awards really mean.
At one time, by tradition, in the East, you couldn't get a Laurel
for anything that someone had already done, unless you had brought
the art form as for above it's previous levels as the previous Laurel
had brought it from nothing. I don't think they use that criterion 
now. I have always been very proud of the high level of chivalry in
our Eastern knights. I have seen white belts at the war on people 
who were not acting in what I would consider a knightly manner 
(making suggestive remarks and gestures towards passing females, then
laughing and looking around for the next one to pass.) No, I have
*no* idea what kingdom they were from, everyone I queried offered a
different suggestion (and that if THEIR knights caught them at it, 
they might have a hard time in the next melee, if not dark alley.)
Perhaps it is simply a market day  syndrome- we're among strangers,
no one recognizes us, let's cut loose. Ah, well...
 	Which reminds me, squires in different areas sometimes can 
wear spurs, sometimes can wear chains (silver but not gold colored),
but always red belts? How is it with you? Pelican proteges, I have
heard, wear purple belts, and Laurel apprentices green. Is this
universal? What are the duties of these positions in various regions?
Is it true that in some kingdoms you can't be knighted if you haven't 
been a squire? 
	What are your local customs in the Crown lists? I heard once 
that only knights were allowed automatically in the Middle Kingdom 
lists, and all others competed for the remaining spots. In another
kingdom, non peers had to have sponsors. Of course, things change
over time, and word of mouth is a notoriously poor source (second
only to memory).
	I have heard that only the West still has a three reigns per
year custom, true or not? Is it true that they have the Crown Tourney
and Coronation the Same Day some places (not just in emergencies)?
	The Rialto recently enjoyed a description of the Eastern last
court. I heard about one where the old king "died" in last court and
took on a new persona. Are there any other interesting ceremonies people
could share?
	Obviously that is enough for now, but like the Elephant's
Child I have "`satiable curiosity".

	Now to do what appears in the Rialto to be called `flaming':
Another, if not consensus, at least popular line is that it is
"Rude" to tell another person what game to play, or how to play the
game. That is ridiculous. How one tells them may or may not be rude. To 
tell them that they are not following the rules is simply appropriate.
(It is, of course, wise to make sure you know what the rules are first.)
	No one thinks it rude to tell someone that one doesn't make a
knight's move it they are playing checkers. If someone tried to tackle
someone in baseball (a la foot ball) they would be corrected. However
in the SCA, given the huge numbers of people, there is always someone
who wants to combine the SCA with other games. 
	While the SCA certainly offers a great deal of variety- and
that is one of the things we hoped to illustrate with the pamphlet 
series- there are certain things the SCA is not meant to encompass.
For example, the Guild of Arachne's Web teaches lace making; but only
varieties of pre-17th century lace- it is not necessary to teach forms
and techniques that were not used after that. Most of us love to dance,
but there is no reason for us to do 17th century or later dances.
This is not to say that there is anything wrong with post 16th century
activities- indeed, it is often necessary to research such sources to
find information on in-period activities. It is also not wrong for
anyone to pursue any of these interests further, away
from the SCA. But that is where it should be done. No one is telling 
you that the SCA must meet all your needs.
	The only excuse that people who want to intrude with non-period
activities use is that they feel like doing it, and what's the harm?
The harm is that hundreds of people have put in thousands of hours,
much effort, and no inconsiderable amount of money to recreate an
image of the European Middle Ages and Renaissance. When someone 
shows up dressed like a Klingon or a Wookie, they are  purposefully
doing something that will wreck it for all of those people. I'd like to 
see how far an argument like that would get you if you were playing any
other sport or game. ( Or imagine someone telling a marshal that it was rude
for him to try and make the contestants follow the Rules of the List!)
	I am not picking fights with people who were told when they 
joined "oh, don't worry about the rules, they are just guidelines, and
there isn't any enforcement procedure anyway." I feel that as long as
the Rules are nebulous and unenforceable we will have these problems and
it falls clearly on the shoulders of the Rule Makers (the Board of 
Directors) to clarify those rules and provide mechanisms for enforcement.
But until they do, my position is that it is rude for anyone (especially
the Crown and Peers who are specifically designated by the Corpora to
both know and uphold the laws of the SCA) to see a breach of these rules
and let it pass. I am not saying to scream at, belittle, embarrass, or
otherwise demean the person who probably though that it was perfectly 
legal for him to be doing it. But to courteously (and all peers have those
skills, don't they?) make correction, so that both the person who made
the mistake, and the rest of the gentles in the SCA will be playing
the same game, that is required.
	The SCA doesn't have umpires, judges, or other "non-players" 
standing and watching us. We are playing a self-invented and evolving
game. But it is a game. And it has rules. And ignoring those rules is
not acceptable.
	To get back to persona, that isn't covered clearly in the rules, 
so the above doesn't really apply to it. I do wish that the BoD
*would* make it clearer. Right now there is discussion at that level on
whether there should be an early period cut-off. I fervently hope they
institute one- no matter what it is. As the SCA changes and grows the 
rules must change to deal with the current reality, and the reality is
that I am not the only one who doesn't know what other people are doing.

	Finally, I want to thank Cariadoc and Justin and all the others
who leapt to my defense when people mistook my meaning and my machine
wasn't working properly.

Another approach that works fairly well (but doesn't eliminate "dashing
around" completely) was thought up by Master Aiden Elfeadur:  buy a *bunch*
of cheap cassettes with screw-together shells and make tapes that have
only one dance per side (you use screw-together shells so that you can take
them apart, put in just enough good tape for one dance, and re-assemble
them).  With an auto-stop or auto-reverse tape player, the convenience
more than makes up for the time spent assembling the tapes.  It also
means that you don't end up always dancing the same dances in the exact
same order...

This may be a matter of taste and style, but when I am taping dances for
SCA use, I make a special effort to *mix* styles, speeds, etc.

One compromise I have used between flexibility and practicality is to tape
dances onto 30-minute cassettes.  This works out to 5-6 dances on a side, so
the dance you're looking for is never more than a minute's rewind away.

I think I must have missed this conversation (the one about women fighters), or
else gotten senile to the point of no longer remembering it.

However, my thoughts on the subject of Fighters of the Female pursuasion:

When I am facing an opponent on the field of honour, there are many things
occurring simultaneously.  The most obvious and overt is the martial contest
to determine who "wins".  Underneath that, though, are several other displays.
The chance to display one's own prowess, and lend opportunity to one's opponent
to display their prowess for example.  To not try me best is, therefore, to deny
that opponent their opportunity to demonstrate their prowess; to display the
fruits of long hours spent acquiring such; to pay homage to all those that took
the time to teach, demonstrate, and otherwise aid one and one's opponent to
reach that moment.

To not strive one's best is unthinkable, and to bow out a discourtesy to one's
opponent and to their teacher(s).

Don't forget that the idea is not to hurt another, but rather to demonstrate skill.
And they that are most skilled can do so without harming their opponent.  If you can
NOT abide by this, then you have no business being on the field.  If you CAN abide
by that stricture, than their should be no objection to striking the a lady, as you
shall not hurt her, and by not giving her a chance to strive, are depriving her
of the fruits of her labours.

Just for general information, the Great Dark Horde has a standing policy of
six months minimum waiting between application and acceptance.  We wouldn't
want someone to make a commitment without an adequate period of experience to

Subject: Yet again on personna...

On Personna Stories,

  When I started in the SCA about 8 years ago, in the northern part of the 
Outlands, personna stories seemed to be in vogue.  I never did quite get the
hang of making one though...  All I did was grab a name out of the air, and 
planted myself into what I felt was a very romantic and exciting part of 
history, namely, early 14th century Scotland during the wars of independence
from Edward Longshanks.  I chose the name MacKinnon as it was the name of one
of the Lords of the Isles and had a rather checkered history.  Of course I 
fought along with The Bruce at Selkirk and Bannochburn (good bragging story).
  That was it for my personna.  I felt that in the SCA I could be exactly as I
felt my inner self to be.  To me, the only part of my personna that is made up
IS my (brief) history, the rest of what I am and do is just me.  I have had it
stated to me that I seemed more like a Kevin than a Dennis, this suits me, and
actually most people who know me (in or out of garb) know me as Kevin.  Since
everyone seems to want to justify all that they do and are in their personna 
"story", I thought that it would be neat to try.  I feel that it would be a bit
presumptious for me to have Robert the Bruce knight me (esp. since it was King
Johan that did it.)  Also, it seems that I have collected a whole family tree
of SCAites along my career, including a little brother (that happens to be a
female), that is now my squire, and a host of wanted and unwanted cousins!  As
I mull this over in my mind I'm thinking maybe I should do a comic strip of my
"personna" story, done along the lines of the famous "Samurai Cat" series of 
picture books!  You know, how a 14th century Scots, marries a 12th century
"european", gets knighted by a 10th century Norseman, squires a 2nd century 
Orduvite celt that is married to a 2nd century Roman whose sister is a Persian
and so on...  Hmmm, maybe I WILL do that comic strip...

Being (something of...my budget can't afford much) a collector of some few fine
blades I have had many experiences with the above problem.  I once was asked to
display my newly-purchased (Shadowmaker-restored) 400-year old Katana to a very
nice person at an event.  I withdrew the blade about 6" from the scabbard and
was in the process of saying "please don't touch..." when she began fingering 
the back.  Kobayashi & I both said "Uhhhh...don't do that!" whereupon she said
something like "oh, I know which side is the edge...it's o.k.".  We then set
to explaining about skin oils, etc. and she apologized for marring the
finish.  Luckily I was still in the process of making the final polish and was
in posession of some light oil, which I immediately applied (thus saving my 
little beauty from damage (whew!).

Since then I've adopted a policy.  If someone asks to see one of my blades, I
(after checking the area and "Clear!"ing) look them straight in the eye and say
"please do not touch the blade in any way...if you want to handle some part of
it then the scabbard, tsuba/quillions, grip, pommel are o.k., but again, please
don't handle the blade at all."  If they say "i won't cut myself" I give a fast
explanation of skin oil and then repeat my entreaty.  Once they understand I 
unsheath the blade as required for viewing.

Since instituting this policy I haven't had another blade marred...

Earl Dafydd,

You are certainly correct as to the details of the membership crunch
in Atlantia, and the transfer of Maryland.  Perhaps it was only
propaganda, but one of the reasons circulated to support the Maryland
transfer (at least, in the East :) was to help Atlantia avoid
membership problems in the future.

Greetings unto the Rialto, from Margrethe von Holbeck.

Someone writes of a Calafian warband with garish clothing under
armor that is rumored to have won battles for them (as opponents
staggered off the field retching).

Surely, even such ugly clothing could not possibly be worse than
the armored fighter at Beltane last weekend, who was wearing-
I kid you not- hot pink.  Head to toe.  

The incipient clothiers guild, which was meeting not ten feet
away, promptly made plans to catch and dye him.

Good Gentles,
 
My lord husband, Sir Garrahan, asked me to post this request:
 
Several months ago (around New Year) he ordered a helm from Thornbird Arms. It
is long past the time it was supposed to have been delivered, but the telephone
is either answered by a machine or busy every time he calls. He is getting
progressively more concerned about his order, and wonders whether any of you
are aware of the armory; whether it is still in business; whether they have
moved or are otherwise dislocated; and/or anything else that might be helpful
in unraveling this problem.
 
I would greatly appreciate any response; please address them to me directly at
expotech@applelink.apple.com, as a network problem has rendered my receipt of
the digest of late rather spotty.
 
Thank you in advance,

So far as I know--it has only happened once since minimum counts were
set up for kingdoms.  In the one case that I know of, the Kingdom in 
question was told they were in danger of ceasing to be a kingdom.  There
was an immediate effort to get people on the membership rolls and the
got back over the minimum without further incident.

I can think of two reasons for the minimum size being where it is--

First, a kingdom needs enough people with enough administrative talent
available to keep the organization going--without burning out people.

Second, a kingdom needs to be large enough to be sure of being able
to mail the newletter at bulk rates.

The Kingdom Constable has been gathering statistics from the gate
lists.  There were 790 people attending Beltane and they arrived
in 390 cars.  About 500 people were members and the other 300 were
non-members.  (This is a lower fraction of members than is ususal
for the West.)

Does anyone have comparable data for other kingdoms?
If so, could you either post it or send it to me via e-mail?

The one this that rises to consciousness from the background noise (and 
bear in mind here that if you agree with the theories in the book that
came out a few few years ago about the "Bicameral Mind", I'm *not* a
sophont . . .), is that those who hold strong personas tend to be very
irritated with those who don't hold with personas--and vice versa.  Other
than that, it's pretty much live and let live.  This may be wrong--but nobody
tends to bother me much.  (On the other hand--it's easy not to be bothered
when you've been a Peer longer than most people have been in the SCA . . .)

Are there any circumstances under which a lady would legitimately wear
a sword?  Any periods or countries in which this was, if not common, at
least unremarkable?  My persona is a Scottish female, from the area near
modern Fort William, around 1150.  The sword is an Irish claymore (Irish
rather than Scottish because it's about three feet shorter, and I can
swing it.).

I have no compunction about cross-dressing, or breaking convention if
necessary, but I would like to at least try for a little authenticity.
Heroines named Shanna with streaming red hair riding astride across
the moors always did annoy me.

Subject: Random mead-brewing question

Unto fellow fishers (and especially brewers), greetings.

I recently (and rather naively) attempted to start a batch of
mead (about 1 gallon) brewing.  My first hitch was relatively simple
and stupid--I put in the lemons at the beginning of the boiling.  The
raw mead tasted of lemon peel slightly, but it didn't worry me
terribly as I often eat citrus peel and don't mind the flavor.  The
initial fermentation went without a hitch (I think)--I brewed using
ballons instead of fermentation locks, but it seemed to work out all
right (this was about 3 1/2 - 4 days).
I now seem to be having trouble with the secondary process.  I
placed the mead in the fridge yesterday.  It was in two 2-liter soda
bottles VERY tightly capped.  The mead filled the bottles to just
below the start of the taper up to the cap.  Today, I checked one
bottle and found that it smelled somewhat sulfurous (I think).  My
main fear is that this is Hydrogen Sulfide, which would be BAD.  My
question is, what's going on?  (i.e., what am I doing wrong).  Some
things I want to know more specifically:
	1) What is that stuff?
	2) How was it produced?
	3) Will it go away?
	4) How stupid was it to open the bottle at this early stage?
	5) If this was due to an aerobic process, how do I get things
going anaerobically?
	6) How do carbonated fermented beverages get carbon dioxide in
them in general, while avoiding the build-up of sulfurous gunk?

These questions come as much from a general interest in what's going
on as a desire to correct this (or, more probably future) batch(es) of
mead.  Please respond direct to me, as I don't want to take up any
more bandwidth, and it's very hard to cut/paste from the digest.
				With many thanks,

Subject: Period New World Feasts? Poisoning your friends.

Gentles:

Some time back, during a "are potatoes period etc." discussion, one
posting asserted that there were royal feasts in period at which they
made a point of serving new world foods, such as potatoes and
tomatoes, as a novelty. I have been unable to find any evidence of
such. In particular "The Columbian Exchange" (by A. W. Crosby Jr.),
which I think was mentioned in the same posting, contains interesting
information on early use of New World foods but no mention  of any
such feasts. I wonder if perhaps this is a case of confusing Society
practice with Period practice--as sometimes happens.

I am therefor posting a request for anyone who has evidence of such
feasts to post it or EMail it to me. The question is not whether
potatoes or tomatoes were eaten in period in Europe(both were), but
whether there were actual Old World feasts (royal or otherwise) that
were presented as "Wonders from the New World" or the like.

Incidentally, for anyone who wants to do period New World cooking,
"The Columbian Exchange" has a fairly clear, period, description of
how Manioc was processed to make it edible. The reason for the
processing is that bitter manioc contains lethal quantities of
prussic acid, so you should be sure you have the recipe down right
before serving it to your friends.

then stopped dead, got a puzzled look on her face, and then ran away.  Obviously,

>Joshua Mittleman (mittle@ibm.com or joshua@paul.rutgers.edu)

I am sorry, Arval, but you are mistaken.  The two events were unrelated,
and were several years apart.  I have checked my memories with Duchess
Melisande de Belvoir (who was Kingdom Seneschal during both events) and
with Duke Richard Corwin/Marshal/FitzGilbert (Diccon is changing his
last name once again) who was King during the membership crunch, and 
with Duke Baudoin MacKenzie who was King when Mirkuuode was ceded to
Atlantia.  The facts are these:

In the summer of 84 or thereabouts the Board upped the membership
requirement for Kingdom status from 200 to 400.  This put Atlantia 
a little bit below the line, with some 360-380 members.  Atlantia
then had a membership drive and within a few months managed to get
enough members to stave off anything silly.  It was very unclear
whether the board would have taken any action anyway, as Atlantia
was still enjoying gradual increase in population and was clearly
both a functioning Kingdom and going to exceed 400 members soon anyway.

Maryland (which is to say, Maryland outside of the Maryland parts of
the Barony of Storvik, which has been part of Atlantia since its 
inception) became part of Atlantia several years later.  Duke
Baudoin assures me that May 1st, 1986, was the official date of
the transfer.  At the time there were fairly few members in the
area (20 or thereabouts)--Merkwid had been downgraded from a Barony
to a Shire a few years previously, and had faded further in the
interim.  Atlantia was well beyond the 400 member limit at the 
time (I would guess around 550).  The transfer was made for reasons
other than the population of the Kingdom.

This was not meant to be a flame, Arval--given a passing knowledge
of the events of the time it is a natural misconception that the
two events were related.  Incidentally, I believe around the time
of the Atlantian membership drive was when you were a herald in
Mirkfaellin, assisting me in designing my Arms when I made frequent
trips up there.

No, that really is how Imperium Compound goes (now) in the East. It may be that,
sometime in the misty past, the two songs got confused by someone, resulting
in the current version, but that's the only version of the chorus I've ever

First, let me say that I am gratified by the number of positive comments I have
received on my posting about viewing the Japanese swords.  I was a fraid it was
too long, but apparently a rather a lot of people enjoyed it.

Fostering:  Well, I don't know how it was done elsewhere, but in Iceland of the
sagas, children were fostered for a variety of reasons, one of which was to
compensate the foster parents for some wrong done by the natural parent.  

If a person of higher rank gives his child to a person of lower rank, then its
an honor.  If a person of lower rank gives his child to a higher rank person,
its a humble request.  Sometimes higher rank people volunteer to take kids as
fosterlings because it enables them to help the family from which the child
comes.  Suppose a man of good character lives in a district with a welathy man,
and this man is in finacial difficulties, either due to some disablity of his
own, or through the whims of nature, or whatever, then the welthier man might
tell hte poor man (with lots of compliments) that it would give the lord great
pleasure and honor to raise the son of such an admirable man.  And thereby
relieve the man of the burden of supporting a child and equipping him for his
adult life.  Fostering was common among the Icelanders, so this was a tactful
way to provide charity to a proud person.  (Pride was an essential part of
Icelanders social graces) 

Persona stories

When I joined SCA I came up with a persona story as that seemed to be the thign
to do. Over time a soon realized, PERSONA STORIES ARE DULL.  So I never tell my
persona story.  On the other hand, there it is in the back of my mind, and I
explain some of my actions in terms of my persona story.  For example, I have a
 Russian costume with pearl beaded headress for summer wear.  Sometimes people
ask me what about it and I explain, "When I traveled in Russia I saw women
wearing clothes like this and I thought it very attractive, so I made one for
myself."   This tells teh person what he wants to know without lecturing (so
many people launch into lectures when asked about their costumes, etc.)  It
also excuses me form any errors and criticism that might be offered about the
garb.  It isn't Russian after all, it's a Viking imitation of Russian.  This
short circuits the Authenticity Police.  

Pennsic Beginner's Guide  Oh boy, this is a biggy.

First, be a prepared camper.  do basic camping thigns like waterproof your tent
before you leave and make sure you have all your tent stakes.  Brign food that
will survive 100 degree heat in a melting cooler.  Keep food simple.  Keep
clothes simple.  Brign any medication you take, or might need.  Nearest
hospital is almost an hour away.  A first aid kit is handy.  A fire
exstinguisher is a good idea, (See Baron Dur's postings in previous Digests
about why this is required equipment)  Brign a set of clothes for each person
in your camp that you keep wrapped in plastic to save it from water so you have
dry clothes if your tent goes under.

IT WILL RAIN.  It wil probably storm, it may even tornado, hail, flood, or
hurricane.  Emergency food in water proof contaienrs will give you something to
eat while drying out your camp and making a run to town to replace camp
fatalities.  Locate your camp carefully. Avoid runoff patterns, find shelter,
the lee of a hill, a line of trees.  Stake your tent firmly.  If it gets windy
(it will) dissasemble any unstable items like dining flies and banners.  This
if better than havign them collapse on top of you (or your neighbors.)  Secure
anything that might fly.  Tents fly very well.  Bring plastic bags to put your
garbage in.  Brign your own drinking water.  

There's nothing harmful in the Pennsic water, but, about half the gentles
attending find they get traveler's diarrhea and other complaints.  Bring your
own water for cookign and drinking.  I go through about a gallon a day at
Pennsic. It's HOT.  Drink lots of water.  Soda is not as good as water to
replenish lost water.  Beer is BAD.  Alcohol increase dehydration, reduces
common sense, and makes you feel good while getting heat stroke or hypothermia.
Fruit juices help replace electrolytes.  Gatorade helps replace electrolytes,
if you can stand the taste.  Be aware that you can overdose on electrolytes,
water should be your basic drink, supplemented by Gatorade and fruit juices.
Heat illness is very common.  Ever seen a field of five hudnred prostrate
people? I have.  

Bring a hat, and sun screen if you're the least bit suceptible to sunburn.
Wear loose, light clothes.  The roads are stony and hilly, so a pair of sturdy
shoes or sandals is a must.  It deosn't matter where you are at Pennsic, any
where you want to go is uphill.  This will be hard on your car.  At least one
car dies every year at Pennsic.  You will also walk a long way at Pennsic.
It's about a mile around the lake.  The lake is not for swimming, there are
swimming holes in the creek.  One is nude, the other is clothed.  The nude
one's easier to find, but really, there is another option is you're shy.

Don't even try to do everything.  REad the schedule and figure out what you
want to do.  There's four times more than you could do no matter how hard you
tried.  

Brign warm sleeping gear.  It gets cold at night.  Brign a variety of weights
of clothes to accomodate changing temperatures.

Bring an experienced person who can tell you who those people in furs are, and
yes, that's an open camp, but no, that's not one, and the heralds are over
there and the chirurgeons are up the road from that.  

DO YOU NEED AN ESCORT AT PENNSIC?  Well, I never have.  But I've heard a couple
of stories.  Iv'e been going to Pennsic since Pensic 8.  On one occassion I was
subjected to rude language (I do not appreciate people I've been gracious to
calling me, "wench")  On the other hand,  sexual morals are a good deal loser
at Pennsic than elsewhere.  It's very much like Carnival in the amount of
drinking and screwing that goes on.  So, if you mix alcohol and socializing, be
sure of your company, and make your limits clear, because when you're in a
fuddled state of mind is not a good time to decided that you only want to be
frieds with the lord who's been eagerly nimbling your neck for the last hour.
I suspect that there are a nubmer of cases of post coitus regret  by sober and
dismayed persons rather than any outright cases of involuntary intimacy.  And
should you find that you are accosted by a person who won' take "no" as answer,
Scream.  You will be promptly rescued by a pack of chivalrous men and women who
are highly offended at the notion of any one daring to comprise their ideal of 
the Dream.  I took part in such rescue once.  The "victim" turned out to be
policeman who didn't know he needed rescuing. It was rather amusing, but
before we knew what was happening people were literally up in arms.  


Go back thorugh previous postings for more info.  Pennsic has been frequently
and thoroughly discussed.  In addition to Lord Dur's postings on fire safety, I
have posted info on how to to survive Pennsic with babies, and so has Marian
Greenleaf, and there have been numerous other contributions on various
subjects, not to mention plenty of war stories and debates about how to run the
land grab.

Riddles

The answer to How do you take the four quarter sof Tokyo out of your sleeve is
to reach into your  kimonop, pull out your handerchief, and fold it into four
quarters.  Zen koan often had actions as answers.  It helped break down the

Subject: SCA Digest #642: The Stonemarche Calligraphers' Motto

Regarding the Stonemarche Calligraphers Motto, Obitus Caledonius Severus,
of Markland, offers this translation:

Omnes viae Romam ducunt, sed nulla (illam) incipiunt in Novo Hampshiro.

Macrons belong on the E of "omnes", the O of "Romam", the first U
of"ducunt", the second O of"Novo", and the O of "Hampshiro".  Illam--"of
them"-- is optional."Hampshiro" is second declension masculine in the
ablative; masculine because "shire" translates best as "ager".
   Caledonius is a classical studies major at George Mason, so I trust he is
correct; however, any additional corrections would be welcomed.

As one of those who lives in that transferred area, but isn't actually
a member so can't ask directly...
what _were_ the reasons for the transfer?  I had wondered, since I found
the Rialto, just where I was, Kingdomwise (having never run across the
Society in any other way), since I saw a posting that put 'southern'
Maryland in Atlantia, but said nothing about any other part of Maryland...

By the way, as long as I'm posting, I'll throw this question out:
Is there a group in Vermont?  Are there even members there?  Anybody know?

 Greeting to the Rialto,

 I was wondering if any Gentles could help me find more information of the
Spanish school of duelling, also on the concept of using same in SCA fencing
combat... There are, that I can find a fem 'minor' problems with this style,
one of which, being that, from what I can find, it requires a blade roughly 4-5
feet in length!
 I have, not as yet had a chance to speak with our Fence Marshal, but thought

all it took was the money (not as much as you'd think, though I don't

I may even have the paper around somewhere, if anyone is interested in
checking it out.

Subject: hockey gloves revisited yet one more time

    Unto the rialto does Domnall MacDaniell send his greetings!
 
    Regarding Lord Arron Reynard's  claim that hockey gloves are sufficient
    protection:
 
         My  lord,  I  must  disagree. An unmodified hockey  glove  is  NOT
    sufficient  protection  for  an SCA heavy lists fighter. A hockey stick
    has less mass, especially in the business end, than a rattan weapon. It
    also has a broader striking surface than a rattan sword, thus spreading
    the  force  over a larger surface area. Also, the type of stroke that a
    hockey player uses has,  I think, less of a follow through than a sword
    swing, giving less power to the stroke.
 
         Two cases in point:
 
         1) In  a  bout with Manfred von Halstern (former  squire  to  Duke
    Sigfried),  I was young and stupid enough to be wearing a ring under my
    glove. Parrying a blow wrong (on  my  hilt),  his sword hit my hand and
    CRUSHED the ring onto my finger. It took a pair  of  pliers to bend the
    ring enough to remove it.
 
         2) At  Pennsic  14 or so, Ros Kean Bullroarer had his hand broken,
    fighting polearm, parrying a Midrealm greatsword.
 
          These two cases seem to  me  to enough evidence to condemn hockey
    gloves. However, for the cost of used gloves, they ARE  the  most  cost
    effective solution for the beginning fighter.
 
          A well-made  set of gauntlets (and the ones I got from Blacksword
    Armoury ARE - free plug)  will  be much more protective, and to me, are
    worth every penny. I fix watches for a hobby; I NEED my hands.
 
    As for unsightly... I don't mind if hockey gloves are unsightly or
    not. I couldn't have afforded to start fighting without  hockey  gloves
    and  very  ugly  carpet armor. That's what surcoats are for: covering a
    multitude of sins. I DO  think  that  every  fighter  should  invest in
    gauntlets or baskethilts as soon as s/he can, though.

Subject: "Hidden" HAndicaps

Ladies, lords, gentles all,
    Unto the Rialto & Baroness Megan ni Laine does Signigraoulph of Kenmore
       Send greetings.
 
   Baroness Megan, I address this to you, as you are a Lady who has been
      an exemplary champion for those within the Society who are more
      used to extra challenges in their daily lives.
 
   I have been reading with interest the discussion on manners to accomodate
      those who have handicaps of one sort or another. These discussions have
      merit, for indeed, we must needs consider the enjoyment of our assembled
      companies for all participants.  However, I would like to bring up a
      point that may not be obvious to everybody.  There are those who have
      "hidden" handicaps (hardness of hearing, allergies, "marginal"
      respiratory problems, etc..).  This is known.  But what about those
      gentles who have these same challenges, but are hesitant about revealing
      same?
 
   To say the Society is a family where we can trust is one thing.  It is
       another to actually allow oneself to engage that trust.  For one reason
       or another we (yes, "we") do not easially let the rest of our worlds
       know about it.  As an example (mine own), it is easy, upon the Rialto,
       to reveal that I have hearing troubles.  I would say that there are
       perhaps less than a dozen outside the rialto that know this.  I would
       be very hesitant to reveal such, in a face-to-face conversation,
       especially if it involved what felt like "imposing" upon someone for
       "special" consideration.
 
   I do not know how to help resolve this effect.  I have never found a way
       to resolve it in my own case.  Not wanting to be a bother, pride,
       preservation of privacy, all these come into play.
 
   I ask, sincerly, what can we, as a group, do?
 
         In Puzzlement, and in Service to the Current Middle Ages,
              I remain --

For those of us who weren't there, this is the first specific

of a letdown -- I was hoping for something juicy.  Here in Calafia,
there is a warband (read "large household that fights as a unit") that
prides itself on its garish, tacky, tasteless, blinding, ... [insert

I don't know about Byzantines in particular, but I think I remember
what my friend Aoibheil (Irish persona, but not a stickler for details
like what continent she's on) wore to Pennsic while breast-feeding.
(Let's see... Meredith was 3 months old for Pennsic.  Aoibheil's best
friend's son was 15 months old.  So-and-so's daughter was 27 months
old.  Is there a pattern here?)  It had a deep plunging neckline, but
covered by essentially a narrow white tabard, running under the belt
and falling to the same length as the dress.  When she wanted to nurse,
she could tuck Meredith's head under the tabard, the kid was out of
the sun (as was Aoibheil's chest), and even modest onlookers weren't
shocked.  With a little Byzantine-looking trim on the edges of the
tabard (and a different color than white, as long as the fabric was
light), it would even look reasonably period.

Disclaimer: I am NOT a costumer.  I make T-tunics and bathrobes for
myself at the rate of one a year, nothing fancy.

Vivat!  I really didn't expect this debate would go on so long, but
it's becoming clear that there are those who consider the afore-
mentioned Richard DeLacy a persona, and like personae, and those who
define "persona" as the ability to recite your family genealogy unto
the seventh generation and dazzle everyone you meet with how much
research you've done, and DON'T like personae.  (And perhaps a very
few, skulking in the shadows somewhere, who DO like that definition
but haven't spoken up.)  The obvious solution is not to define it that
way.
In my experience, the people who try to recite their family genealogy
unto the seventh generation and all that tend to be those with less
that six months' experience in the SCA, who for some reason hear the
word "persona" and automatically apply the latter definition until
they find out it doesn't work and people don't want to listen to them.

The trick is that acquiring "the mind-set of a medieval individual" is
considerably harder than making up and memorizing a bunch of names and
an improbable story.  And it's harder to show off once you've done
some of it.  But it's much more interesting, more educational, more
authentic, and in my opinion more fun.

Greetings to the gentles of the Rialto!

We are compiling a comprehensive list of good (SCA-usable),
commercially available period dance music, and we'd like your input! 
We're frustrated at going to record stores, and staring at the covers
of cd's, trying to guess whether they're any good or not, so we are
assembling a discography complete with reviews for Justin's
_Letter_of_Dance_.  

First, a few definitions. 

"Period dance music": Playford, Arbeau, Italian, etc. from period 
+ other stuff really common in the SCA.  

"Commercially available": available at stores, or via mail order. NOT
"well, I have a fifth generation copy that you can dub off a copy
of...".  SCA stuff like the Rose and Nefr Dance Tapes would be good,
if you can include an address from where it can be ordered, and the
price. 

"Usable": easily danceable to, at least one complete repeat of the
dance (lots of tapes have partial versions of a dance... you start to
go into the third figure, and the music disappears!), no funny stuff
(extra repeats of figures, melodies from other dances interwoven,
etc.).  

Note: lots of generic tapes of medieval music include a few tracks
labelled as "Pavanne", "Alman", "Branle", and so on.  We have found
these to be rarely useful, and often unidentifiable as that kind of
dance... what we're really looking for is recordings dedicated to
dance music, with specific dance titles, that meet the usable
qualifications.

If any of you could help by emailing us a review (example below), we
would greatly appreciate it!  We would like as much information on
each recording as possible, (name, artists, publisher, publisher's
item number, dances included, price, and a quick review of its
quality/usability would all be nice) so drag your tape case into work
(or wherever) and copy the info off.  (If you can't send complete
info, that's OK, send us your thoughts & opinions, and we'll do the
legwork.) We'll collate and format everything, and send it off to
Justin for _The_Letter_of_Dance_.  If you would like a summary of
what we receive, let us know.  Thanks!

Sample listing and review:

_Danses_Populaires_Francaises_et_Anglaises_du_XVIc_Siecle_
Broadside Band with Jeremy Barlow - Harmonia Mundi/HMC 901152

Danses Populaires is nice collection of dance music, and especially
useful as it contains music for several dances from both Arbeau and
Playford.  The music is arranged nicely, with variations between the 
different repeats of the same dance; this makes each dance sound
pretty and interesting without adding so much as to cause confusion. 
Lots of albums will take medieval dance music and twiddle it to be
appealing to modern tastes, which often makes it useless for dance;
this album succeeds in presenting interesting but still very
danceable music.  Most of the music is on the sedate, slower side,
including the English country.  

In general, we highly recommend this; but there are a few specific
pieces that you might want to use caution with for SCA dance: the
first Tourdion and the second and third Galliard are slow and quiet,
and don't really have the clear syncopated beat that helps keep
dancers in time.  We're used to doing the Scottish branle alternating
between the "first" and "second" branles as described in Arbeau, pp.
148-151; this recording has two repeats of the "first" and two of the
"second", which is confusing if your dancers are used to it the other
way around.  Finally, the version of Washerwomen's bransle is really
nifty, and the "scolding" parts sound wonderful... but Barlow got a
little carried away with them: Arbeau has four "scolding" singles (p.
156), but this version has 8 the first time through, and 16 during
the later repeats!  The changing number of singles here may be
confusing to dancers.  These few problems, though, are quite
outweighed by the rest of the music, which is very usable for SCA
dance.

Music included:

A. from Arbeau (Branles, etc.)
Double / Simple / Gay / Burgogne // Cassandra / Pinagay / Charlotte
// Jouissance vous Donneray / Tourdion / Tourdion // Pavane "Belle
qui tiens ma vie" / Galliarde "La Traditore my fa moire / G.
"Antionette" / G.  "J'aymerois mieulx dormir seulette" / La Volta // 
Poictou / Ecosse / Bretagne // Malte / Lavandieres / Chevaulx //
Jouissance / 3 French Corantos / Basse "La Roque" / Recercada Segunda
// Haye / Official // Moresques / Canaries / Bouffons

B.  from Playford 1651 
Grimstock // Upon a Summer's Day // The Spanish Gipsy // Rufty Tufty
// Gray's Inn Mask // Bobbing Joe // Heart's Ease

// = separate tracks.  
/ = several dances are included in a single CD track.  There's a
brief pause between them... if you wanted, for example, to set up a
tape with several versions of branle Charlotte, you _could_ separate
it off when dubbing a copy, but it does take effort.

  I don't understand really why Outlands seems to be losing some ground.  Our
group and the other (smaller) groups around us seem to be growing by leaps and
bounds.  In the last 3 (mentioned) months, Unser Hafen has added 2 or 3 new 
members each month (sustaining, other types are also on the rise).  Oh well, I
guess you just never can tell...

Subject: Chitons

To quote Caitrin Gordon on making a Greek Chiton:
The Greek chiton uses the timeworn principle of the "square".  The simplest
chiton is simply made of two squares sewn together from the floor to a few
inches below the wrist and fastened with buttons spaced about three inches
apart from the wrist to the neck. (end quote)

Cait, thanks for giving me an opening to one of my favorite pieces of odd
information. My costume history/design teacher in college taught us a different
way of making a chiton, which drapes in a way I prefer to the above method.
Instead of using two pieces of fabric, use one long one.

The dimensions of the fabric:
The width of the fabric is the distance from your shoulder to the ground.
  (This can very depending on style--I'll explain later.)
The length of the fabric is twice the distance between the tips of your fingers
  (or less if you need to, but don't decrease it by too much or it looks odd.)
How this fabric makes a chiton:
DO NOT CUT THE FABRIC.  Fold it in half width-wise.  Position yourself within
the fabric so the fold is located at one hand and the open half at the other.
Overlap the fabric at your shoulders, gathering it as you choose, and pin it.

Variations on the theme:
If you were a woman from Sparta, you might well wear the chiton just like that,
without sewing up the side.  If you were a "later period Greek" from Athens,
you would probably sew up the side.  You also might have a peplum, kolpos or
fancy method of girdling the chiton. (Sometimes they got quite complicated!)

Peplum & kolpos---A folded over section at the top of the chiton made by
pinning together two folds instead of two edges at your shoulders, and a folded
over section made by girdling the waist and then pulling excess material over
the girdle (which was frequently then girdled again on top of the fold).

Two other variations are to pin only one shoulder of the chiton or to run pins
at intervals down the arms making sleeves.

I am willing to believe that chitons were made of two separate pieces of
material "in period", but I know they were also made this way and the resulting
garment falls quite nicely...once you get used to putting it on.  The first
couple of times you try to pin yourself into one...well, you may come up with
some creative phrases to express your feelings.  Especially if you want folds
like the ones in Greek statuary.  The softer the fabric, the better your odds
of the folds working like the pictures it seems.  (Personal opinion--chitons
that fall like the pictures and aren't flat fabric are easier on the eye.)

Oh, and one other interesting scrap--The tops of these were generally fastened
with fibulae (pins composed of a pretty part and then a very long, narrow
pointy part), of which certain styles were eventually outlawed.  It seems that
a great number of crimes of passion were occurring due to the ready
availability of weapons!

Subject: new&nervous, personae

The Rialto makes people nervous?   ... uh, like, wow!  :]

I still think of myself as sorta new (coming up on three years; around
here, you're not really established until you've been around for 6 or
8) and it never really occured to me that I should worry about looking
like an idiot.  Mortal creatures are idiots by definition, and I would
much rather someone paid me the regard to *tell me* I was possessed of
an usuportable opinion than snickered up their sleeve.

Then again, I get accussed of having more guts than brains on a regular
basis, and I hit a lot of very friendly people prone to explaining things
in depth shortly after I joined.


As far as personae go; I have two problems with attempting to have one
(for myself; this is in no way to be interpreted as a generalization!).

Firstly, I *can't* do everything I already do under the ambit of a
single role; I'm a scribe, a group officer, I arch, I do field heraldry
(something that would not have existed until three hundred years after
the Insular illumination I mostly do), and other miscalaneous bits
like trying to write poetry and building armor.  The temporal spread
for these things is easily six hundred years, between the English
longbow and the peak and flower of insular calligraphy.

Secondly, I can't pretend to be a period person without misrepresenting
some of Graydon's opinions; period people accepted slavery(serfdom,
thralls, whatever), rigid social stratification, the existence of
some form of _the_ truth, that it was OK to try and kill people who
offended you sufficently, and that women were mostly good for the
inheritance they brought to the marriage and as baby factories.
Certainly, not every period person believed all of these, but who
from what period would not have believed *any* of them?  I tend to
assume that people with strong personas avoid those areas in which
the persona's opinion would diverge radically from the person's,
but I'm not enough of an actor nor willing to compartmentalize my
head enough to do that.  Hence, no persona.  Although I would like
to hear the opinions of those with well developed personas on this
subject; I can't figure out how you keep it straight.

The SCA, for me, is a social group that gives me a context to do
things which I find interesting, but it's not a persona's view
that such and so is right and proper for a young lord to know,
it's my view that these things are fun.

Hmmmm....Personna booklets?

Well, people are like books.  All of us have a cover, by which we are judged
(despite the traditional warnings against it).  What would I find if I opened
you up for a look?

Some fill their books with great scholarlly works, with a plethora of minute
details.  These tomes appeal to fellow scholars.

Some are outlines, destined to be filled with either the experience of life
within the Known Worlde, scholarly datum, or a combination of both.  While
these books may never be finished, they are subject to edits and rewrites as
suits the author.

There are even books with unblemished pages, though the cover seems tattered
and worn.  Though these books provide little sustenance for the avid
researcher, they do provide an air of completeness to our collective library.

Each of us will gravitate to books we enjoy (I like the ones with pictures).
This is one view of the "personna library" (in short form) that I use to
explain why people approach the SCA in different ways, none more right than
any other.

         Researchers embark on hunt for grave of Genghis Khan
         ----------------------------------------------------
A convoy carrying researchers from Japan and Mongolia roared off into
the Mongolian plains yesterday in search  of the grave of Genghis Khan,
the 13th-century Mongolian warrior. The search is financed by Japanese
newspapers and TV stations. One thousand people watched as 40 Mongolian
horsemen led the motorcade out of Ulan Bator's huge Sukhbator Square.
Wrestlers and dancers in traditional Mongolian dress performed, and then
the study group headed east for Hentiy province, where the conqueror's
grave is believed to be located. Genghis Khan united Mongolia's tribes
and forged an empire that stretched from the borders of Easter Europe to
the Korean Peninsula. He was buried in a secret spot that China says
lies in its Inner Mongolian region. Mongolians dispute that.

//////////////////end quoted article//////////////////////////////////////
What I remember from Harold Lamb's book on Genghis was that the Khan was
buried someplace in secret, the burial party was killed off, and a river
was diverted to cover his grave. Any of our Mongol/Dark Horde type friends
have any better researched comments on this? I'm quoting from memory of
a book read many years ago.  Also, I'm not sure if Mongolians are disputing
that  Genghis was buried in Inner Mongolia, or that China owns Mongolia. :]

Gentles, greetings from Arval!

I think that the past week's discussion has revealed that there are
two very distinct meanings of "persona."  Some people define it as "a
character history, set within the domain of the SCA, to which one
models one's activities, grab, etc."  Others define it "a role which
one plays in the SCA."  These are quite different concepts, and I
think that they both have merit, used properly.  Either is annoying
when taken to extremes.  Trying to force one's own intrepretation on
others is always inappropriate, and should be dealt with as any other
blatant rudeness.

 Now, WAIT! SCA activity is based on doing mediaeval things in a mediaeval
manner. And this depends on people going out and DOING them, not on
concocting imaginary autobiographies. Does one need a "persona" to
wear an outfit? I submit, no. Does one need a "persona" to fight in the 
lists, to cook period dishes, to write poems, to dance, to illuminate,
to play ombre or Rithomachy? Hardly.
  And what of somebody whose interests are not neatly confined within
one space-time segment? Does one need a different persona for every
outfit in the wardrobe, or for each favored pastime? What is someone's
"persona" does not fit an event theme? (I keep having visions of "And now,
a galliard. Everyone with a persona earlier than 1490 will leave the room".)
   This may sound silly, but I was at a marshallate meeting where it was
actually proposed that they should try to eliminate such offenses as
"a Viking [i.e., somebody with a "viking" (i.e., Scandinavian) persona]
using a katana". I submit that His Majesty's officers have better things
to do than trying to be the Persona Police.
   In sum, Society activity is based on ... activities. "Persona" is only
frosting on the cake. (Would someone care to advise me on how to conduct
an authentic Ecbenite persona?)

The Ansteorran swashbucklers were extremely active about 10 years ago,
and many of them are still poking away in some areas...

Much of the modern fencing rules came from those times...

Far rather would I see armor held together with duct tape--at least at

Heraldry in action - everybody (and I mean everybody, even the blind)
knew both *who* and *where* this gentle was.  My former
Knight-Marshall has a bright yellow tabard with a black elephant on it
- nobody ever has to ask "Where's Ken?"

This is the purpose of such garish clothing - to be recognized from
afar.  In this, the gentle to whom Hal is referring succeeded.

(Raised eyebrow.) Not me, kimosabe. I've used the electronic armorial, but
had absolutely nothing to do with setting it up...

Which brings me to a more general point: people, I know that I'm awfully
conspicuous, but I *don't* run everything here. I don't run the on-line
armorial, I don't run the contact list, and I most certainly don't run the
Rialto. I just do the Rolls Ethereal, kibitz about the running of the
Rialto, and generally talk a lot. Let's give credit where credit is due,
to Danulf, Eowyn, Ragnar, and all those other folks who do all the other jobs,
some of them putting in a lot more work than I do.

(This isn't really directed at you, Joe, but rather at all the people who
have been sending me "add/drop me from the Rialto" and "I'm the contact
for West Hoositania" messages...)

I'm beginning to think that the Rialto has hit a level of size and complexity
that a once-a-month explanatory note is in order. This would describe what
the Rolls and Contact lists are, how to ftp those (as well as the armorial),
how to change your mailing list status if you're on the digest side of the
Rialto, and suchlike. What do people think? Do we have anyone who wants to
run this monthly message? (It wouldn't be an awful lot of work after the
initial setup phase...)

To all fishers of the Rialto, Greetings!
   I have been skimming books on armour, and weaponry, for years trying
to find information on their _manufacture_, rather than just photo's of
different styles and their ornamentation. Such vital information as
weights, sizes, and thicknesses, is difficult to find, never mind
descriptions of the forging techniques used in period. Could any of the
experts around here point me at a couple of good reference books to
get started with?

Thank you,

This idea is reminiceint of the Pennsic Protege' Program that several of us
have been trying to get off the ground for years.  To wit:

If you are a Pennsic Vet, you can make or break the War for a first timer.
Many folks come to these major events and have no real concept of what goes
on.  I've seen avowed camping vets literally destroy themselves in spite of
their camping knowledge.  Besides mentoring (in a benign fashion is more
readily accepted than the "listen to ME!" directive method), this is an
opportunity to make new and lasting friendships.

If you have never been to a War before, never fear.  The community of the War
will certainly provide a friendly native (as well as surly, foriegn) guides,
just for the asking.  Just be discerning of the type of person you ask for
help, or you may get other than you desire.  And if someone should call you a
"Pennsic Virgin," don't take affront.  Everybody had a "first War" at sometime
or other.

Subject: Nervous Newbies

Greetings to the good gentles of the Rialto!

I read with interest and relief Hal Ravn's message addressing the
"unnerving" nature of some of the discussions in this forum.
(I don't know how to do the neat trick of taking pieces of one message
to quote in another - I will try to paraphrase or quote again if I need
to.)

Although I have been around and aware of the Society for a long time
(my first event being an Atenveldt crown tourney in the then-Principality
of Ansteorra), I have drifted away in the past few years.  I was
delighted to discover the Rialto last fall - in fact, I believe it was
Hal who instructed me on how to enroll.

I must confess that I've been feeling very stupid and new and incapable
in the months I have been reading the Rialto.  Everyone seems so very
knowledgeable and authentic and established - and I confess to being a
bit intimidated by that.  It hasn't helped that my mundane schedule has
made it difficult if not impossible to attend local events and meetings.
My primary contact with the Society at this point is through the Rialto,
where I am exposed to a lot of fine points but not too many basics.

Please don't get me wrong - I'm fascinated by all of the fine points,
and read them carefully.  And I have sent private messages to some of
the posters.  But I feel very vulnerable sending anything to the group
as a whole.  Believe it or not, this is a hard message for me to send.

So I was glad to read Hal's advice on contacting people, and some
general reminders that "newcomers *aren't* expected to be up on all the
details of costuming, behavior, social etiquette, and who all the "brass
hats" are and what perks are due them."

I do have a suggestion, and that is to have a similar posting appear on
a monthly or otherwise regular basis.  New people are finding this forum
all the time, and I'm sure that they would appreciate the consideration
and courtesy of gracefully finding a way to establish a niche and
participate in this Society that we all enjoy.

My thanks to you for your patience.

I didn't mean to say you were lying, merely overreacting. I really never

If you really *have* encountered them, then we may be seeing another

Well, the subject at hand *was* this persona problem. I certainly won't
argue that there are far too many people around who are snobbish about
something. I've encountered Garb Snobs, Armor Snobs, Heraldry Snobs, Dance
Snobs (a trap that I spend a lot of effort avoiding), Fighting Snobs --
generally, Snobs of most every description. But this concept of the Persona
Nazi is rather new, and a tad disturbing.

Curious. I really wonder if there is a bit of cultural difference here.
More and more, it sounds like persona is much more of an *issue* out West
than I've seen it around here. Your strongly anti-persona bent would be,
I think, perceived as rather strange in the East, but so would the person
so fanatically bent on insisting that people develop "proper" personae.
Certainly, the default assumption around here is that persona is a Good
Thing, but things generally seem to be more laid back on that point than
you make it sound out West...

(Or am I over-generalizing? Do such Persona Nazis exist around here, and
I simply haven't encountered them? Opinions?)

Don't confuse naivete with Nazism. I will (and did) grant that Arastorm's
view is a little provincial, and is based on a definite world-view of the
Society. But she has not, in my experience, tried to *impose* that world-
view on others, which is the real rub. Naivete is easily curable, and very
common; I don't think that anyone in the Society is truly cosmopolitan on
every issue, and we all get surprised by the customs in other areas 
occasionally. The sin lies in trying to force others into your own mold,
and the ones who commit it are the ones I worry about. It concerns me a
lot that this sort of proselytizer exists; the very concept seems... well,
unchivalrous...

Subject: Nursing mothers and Pennsic

In period, upper-class mothers did not generally nurse their own children.
That's what wet-nurses were for.
  
However, since there's no wet-nursing guild in the SCA, nursing mothers have
to make do.  I'm not a mother myself, but I have a possible idea for garb
that would be suitable for both Pennsic and for nursing mothers.  It's cool,
it's comfortable, it's ridiculously easy to make . . . though arguably, it's
not in period (although I don't know that for certain).  It's the Greek chiton,
the garb of choice of Meridian women in the hot summer months (which have
already started down here).
  
The Greek chiton uses the timeworn principle of the "square".  The simplest
chiton is simply made of two squares sewn together from the floor to a few
inches below the wrist and fastened with buttons spaced about three inches
apart from the wrist to the neck.  Another summer chiton, the one which I
think would be eminently adaptable for nursing garb, is sleeveless.  The
square is overlapped at the top to form a fall of cloth over the back and
shoulders (note the sophisticated graphics to follow):
  
        fastenings -->   o--------o
                         /        \ <---fall of cloth)

OK, so this computer is limited at best.  Basically, you cut the cloth about
a foot and a half longer than you need it to reach from the shoulder to the
ankles.  Sew the sides from the floor to a few inches under the arms, depend-
ing on how big an armhole you want.  Fold the extra foot and a half of cloth
at the top so that the extra panel of cloth covers the front and back of
the chiton.  Fasten the chiton just over the points of the shoulders with
a couple strong stitches or a button.
  
This might be fairly easy to adapt to a nursing mother.  The front panel of
the chiton would not cover the breasts alone, but it WOULD hide any closures
used for a nursing panel.  Some ideas might be to cut out a square in the
chiton for the breasts and use some extra material to make a flap that could
button or snap in place; the extra-cloth fall would cover this closure
nicely.  The chiton also affords sufficient coverage so that a nursing 
mother could wear a nursing bra without it having to show; the placement of
the shoulder closures would be easily adjusted to cover the straps.  It also
follows all the necessities for Pennsic: easy to make, cool and washable.
A longer chiton, using the same principle but going from wrist to wrist, 
would be easy to make for some of the cooler, rainy days.
  
And, on top of that, a Byzantine nursing mother wouldn't have to go all that
far out of her persona to do it.

Subject: what we do and why

Greetings all from Richard Gilbert,


	I guess to be internally consistent I have to write this as Richard
Gilbert and not Richard DeLacy, since it is on the subject of persona.  By
definition Richard DeLacy is unfamiliar with what we mean by persona, although
of course he is familiar with role-playing - (He is an avid fan of the more
modern Theatre - especially that hilarious bawd Shakespeare).  
              
	For a moment let me digress for some background on my persona: Richard
DeLacy, born late 16th century England - traveled to Court of Carolingia, took
service in the Baron's Guard and eventually formed the more permanent bond to
the Baron of becoming his Squire.  That is it.  But it is definitely a persona
and without it, as I will explain I could not do many of the most fun things I
do in the SCA.
              
	I think the key to this is considering exactly what a persona is. 
Arastorm and Will Linden might not be as far from each other as their postings
might lead one to believe.  Arastorm says that the SCA is based on personae
while many others, Will included, say why do we need them?  The SCA is based on
what we actually _do_, or as someone said, on doing period things in period
ways.  
              
	I feel that the two are one and the same.  Richard Gilbert can do many
period things in period ways.  For example, with a great deal more work, and a
proper costume, I believe I could dance period dances in a period way. 
Furthermore, Richard Gilbert _enjoys_ period dancing.  However, there are some
things that Richard Gilbert _could_not_do_ in a period manner.  The best
examples are fighting and fencing.  Assuming (for argument's sake) that we
knew and used period technique in these two activities, Ric Gilbert couldn't
do them.  Ric Gilbert is: 1) afraid of being hurt (I hate pain) and
			  2) afraid of hurting other people

Ric Gilbert _is_ however, a good SCA fencer and a beginning fighter.  I enjoy
fencing and fighting both.  Richard DeLacy, however, enjoys dueling.  There is
a difference.  I recall a few years ago at a fencing tourney The Sir Michael of
York slipped a blade under my guard and tip-cut my throat.  A "kill" by our
rules.  As I fell however, I had a momentary vision of the blood leaping in
spurts from my throat and the pain involved in a real blow of this nature.  
It served to remind me of what we are recreating.  Now Richard DeLacy is not a
bloodthirsty individual - but he enjoys two violent sports.  He enjoys the
andrenaline rush of combat.  Mundane fencing is not nearly as interesting to me
simply because the stakes are unimportant.  The stakes in a duel are much more
interesting. 

	 Anyway, I have rambled slightly off target.  What I am trying to
say is really an answer to Will Linden's question "Why do they need personae to
do things?  Why do they need persona to fight, to dance ... to do all the
fascinating things we do?"  My answer is that persona _are_ necessary - Not
elaborate stories about where we are from, but the mind-set of a medieval
individual.  Without this mind-set we cannot do _any_ actual creative
recreation of period arts.  We might completely and accurately reproduce a
garment of the period, or accurately use a fencing maneuver from George Silver,
but in order to make a change in either - to refit the garment so it fits us, or
change the maneuver in order to compensate for an opponent's action - or more
strongly to change the garment so we like it better or vary the maneuver to be
"more effective"  we need the guidance of the persona, the medieval viewpoint,
to have any hope of finishing with a garment or maneuver "in a period style".

	In sum, there are two reasons that we need personae.  First, the less
concrete, because while we mundanely enjoy recreating things, there are things
which only our personae actually enjoy once recreated.  This explains not only
fighting (and I don't want to meet the person who mundanely enjoys maiming
people) but also those period artforms which produce mundanely hideous things,
bagpipes for example :-) :-) :-)   And the second reason, more concrete, is
that the persona as a mindset allows us to think like a medieval person and in
so doing have a better chance at recreating the middle ages accurately.  


		In service to my friends,

Subject: Re:  Fencers unite!...Where are you!...

Unto the good folk of the Rialto, greetings,

I have for some time now been collecting information of various kinds  for a
report on the status of rapier combat in the Knowne Worlds.  The report is
intended for TI (as well as my various bosses), and I don't want to post too
much right now.  I will, however give a brief summary of what I've learned.

Ansteorra, Outlands, East, Atlantia, An Tir, and Trimaris all have fencing
well established, with each having a Kingdom officer charged with promoting
fencing and a set of rules governing rapier combat.  In most of these kingdoms
fencing is well enough established that even given an antipathetic Crown,
fencing will continue though perhaps not enjoy the supportive environment it
could wish.  Trimairis is emerging from such a state, the East may be heading
into one.

The Rules for Rapier Combat in these kingdoms vary widely.  The variations come
in such areas as permitted weapons, authorized styles, target area, and armor
standards.  All seem to protect the fencer fairly well.

The Midrealm, West, Calontir, and Meridies prohibit fencing at SCA events.
There is some variation in the reasons for this, however the consistent reason
is that these kingdoms feel that fencing is unsafe, and that there is no way
to make it safe.  A part of my report will be devoted to an attempt to refute
this idea, and to debunking some of the myths that have crept in.

Atenveldt and Caid do not have a particular officer or set of rules for Rapier
Combat, nor, however do they outlaw it.  Instead both kingdoms classify
rapier combat in the category of 'light weapons', which in both kingdoms seems
to be primarily shinai.  Both kingdoms inform me that rapier combat is allowed
but is not practiced much.  I am still pursuing research in this area.

The SCA corporate level neither encourages or actively discourages period
rapier combat.  Guiding and police decision #5 allows period rapier combat
provided that the kingdom permits it, that the Marshallate of the Kingdom
has a set of rules in place governing it, and that those rules have been
approved by the Society Marshall.  The decision does further state, however,
that since period fencing was not a part of formal tournament combat in the
Middle Ages, rapier combat may not be a part of formal tournament lists for
royal rank or armigerous titles.

This then is, briefly, what is going on in fencing in the Knowne Worlde.  I,
as ever, welcome additional information and/or corrections, and thank all
those, on and off the Rialto, who have assisted me in the collection of data.

Subject: Re: Hockey Gloves

>   How does one armor hockey gloves?

   I took heavy (not quite 1/4 inch) leather, reject from a local supplier
of shoe leather, and made a set of plates.  For each hand I made a large one
to cover the backs of the fingers, and _5_ small plates, which I taped beside
and between the fingers.  In this fashion blows striking the big plate are
transferred through the finger plates onto the haft of my weapon (glaive).
This worked quite well for 2.5 years, before the gloves gave out.  Note
that this gives unsufficient protection against blows to the thumb - the
plates on the thumbs of most gloves are inadequate.  However, I could take
a full power blow to the back of my fingers, even at a decent angle.  Good
boiled leather is best: note that simply boiling leather in water will result
in considerable stiffening (removes oils) at the cost of longevity.
   Some people in my area have taken kytex and made armadillo-type
articulated shells that fit over the glove.  Same idea - the kytex alone is
not as strong as metal, but the combination is pretty good.

   Note that if you are spending too much $ and time on these juryrigs it
is better to spend such on good gauntlets.  Rationalization is fun, but
armor is better.  I'm currently building metal gauntlets.

I'm sorry to see the very existence of such folks become a topic for
potential flamage.  Yes, such persons exist.  I have met a number of them
over the past 15 years.  Yes, they are very much in the minority in most
places I have visited.  Yes, some individuals are just plain obnoxious and
probably would be obnoxious in whatever milieu you happened to meet
them.  Yes, some of them act like they are paranoid.  Yes, there are
people who scavenge for newcomers to add to their own personal train
(and to bolster their sense of their own consequence.)  Yes, there are
individuals who will make a scene if they see a zipper in your garb.  Yes,
there are people who, for whatever reasons, assume that the way they do
it is the Only Right Way.  Yes, all of us are only human.  That's why
we're here instead of on the Astral Plane. ;-)

And, NO, you don't have to let such a person get to you.  NO, you don't have 
to let anyone make you feel worthless.  NO, you don't have to accord to anyone
who is acting unreasonably, more authority than their behavior tells you
they deserve.  And Yes, I know that this can be hard when you are new
and uncertain of yourself!!  I almost dropped out over this sort of
thing, more than once, the first 6 years I was hanging around the SCA.
And NO, you don't even need to flame such people.  That is more attention 
than their behavior warrants, and may even encourage some who seek attention.
You can ignore them in very courteous ways.  Even gently humorous ways.

And Yes, most of us are not like that, and Yes, we can keep it fun for
all of us if we keep our own attitudes tolerant, and pursue whatever it
is we love in the Current Middle Ages, rather than focus on the
negative.  That, in my view, is the proper application for strength of
character--the courage to pursue what we love, and to tolerate
diversity in the pursuits of others.

And Yes, it is just fine to disagree with me.  I may disgree back.

As close to a flame as I feel that I can reasonably get in this forum,

Well, Rapier combat is the most entrenched/accepted/practiced in Ansteorra,
with reports of 80-man Queen's Champion Tournaments, and the White Scarves
a Grant Level Rapier Combat award.  But, the Ansteorrans are the ones to ramble
at length about that.

Here in the Outlands, Rapier combat is fairly well off, and expanding at a
decent pace.  We also have the White Scarf, and the attendant title of Don/Dona
by treaty with Ansteorra (Instituted in the reigns of HRM Artan of the
Outlands and HRM Seamus of Ansteorra), although the Outlandish White Scarf
carries only an AoA.  We have never had 80 fighters in a tournament, although
we get 20-30 fairly regularly at major tournaments.

As to the East, from what I have seen, and by rumour, it appears that the
Guild structure in the East has been lifted almost whole cloth from a 
document by an Outlandish fencer, Mondragon, or Mindrakken Van Der Zilver.
The document he wrote, entitled something like 'A Proposal for the
Establishment of an Academy of Fence' went around 4 or so years ago, when
we were codifying and expanding our Rapier standards and rules.  He sent copies
off to all the Crowned Heads, and it appears that the East drew heavily on this
when establishing their Guild structure.  Eastrealmers!  Can anybody verify or
discredit this?  


Atenveldt has a rapier culture, although Master Iosef, also on the net is a 
better one than I to discuss it.


Niccolo Drogo, does this answer your question?

Subject: How to write letters of recommendation

The following is an article I have submitted for publication in the
East Kingdom newsletter, Pikestaff.  I hope it is of interest to those
in other Kingdoms, as well.  Permission to reprint this article in any
SCA publication is freely granted.  (Just let me know if you are doing
so, and in what publication.)

=====================================================================

		HOW TO WRITE A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION
		   by Baroness Jessa d'Avondale 
		   
There have been many articles that tell you how to write to the King and Queen
to recommend someone for an award.  As I have had to help deal with some of the
letters Their Royal Majesties (TRM) of the East receive, I present here some
guidelines, which, while not guaranteeing the award will be given, will make it
a lot easier for Them to do so. 

To begin with, write legibly, and if you have more than one recommendation,
make that obvious at first sight - sometimes TRM must skim through a stack of
papers, looking for a particular name.  Even better is to put each
recommendation on a separate page.  If that would generate too much paper, you
should at least group the recommendations by category:  AoA's separate from
Laurels, etc.  If someone writes a letter to TRM concerning 3 different types
of awards, plus an invitation to an upcoming event, plus a Letter of Intent for
Crown, either it will be torn into 5 little pieces in order to be filed
properly, or it will be filed under one topic, and the others may be
overlooked. 

Next, remember the 5 W's used by chroniclers (or event autocrats!):  Who, What,
Where, Why, When. 

WHO is the person you are recommending?  Write or print the full name clearly,
so TRM don't send in a misspelling when They request the scroll. 

WHAT award are you recommending this person for?  State this plainly so TRM
don't have to read between the lines to figure it out.  Also, don't feel 
that you must write "forsoothly"; sometime this only obscures what you are 
trying to say.

WHERE (in the SCA) does this person live?  TRM often have Their itinerary
planned out months in advance, and need to know if They will be in, or near,
the group the person lives in.

(Underlining or highlighting these first 3 is not a bad idea - TRM have a lot
of paperwork to look at, and this will make Their job easier.) 

WHY does this person deserve the award?  Read Corpora or Kingdom Law to find
the reasons for giving Society- and Kingdom-level awards.  What has the
person done, and for how long?  The more information TRM have, especially for
the polling orders, the better. 

WHEN will this person be attending events?  Tell TRM if you know that he/she
will be travelling to specific events, especially those that are already
Royal Progresses.

If you want to impress upon TRM that many people in the group feel the award
should be given, have them all write, rather than sending in a petition.
Petitions are all too easy to sign, but a collection of letters will give TRM
many different views and insights to consider.

Send your letter to TRM far in advance of when you'd like to see the award
given.  They will need to request scrolls months ahead of time.  Save a
copy of your letter, so that if some of your recommended awards are not given,
you can send them to the next set of monarchs.  It isn't always easy for TRM
to find your previous letters in Their predecessors' file.  (See the above
comments about filing!)  Reading old letters and trying to verify if the
awards were ever given is more work than TRM have time for.

Finally include your own name and address and/or phone number, in case TRM have
any questions about your recommendation, or if They'd like to notify you that
the award will be given, and ask you to get your recommendee to the event!

First, I have noticed that most people on Rialto use their mundane names, so I 
will also.
 
Second, just as a change of pace, as a squire my first loyalties lie with my 
knight.  It is to him that I am sworn and I am his man. 
 With that goes my loyalty to the household and it's members.  Because 
of my knight's fealty to the Crown, there follows my next loyalty. 
 My last loyalty is to my Shire.  The thing I have not mentioned, 
because to my personna it's assumed, is the first and foremost loyalty to God 
and His Church.

Subject: Garb for nursing?

Greetings to all gentles in the Knowne World,
I plan to still be nursing my baby by Pennsic, and have a problem.
As far as I know, no Byzantine styles accomodate nursing!  The
styles I've seen for Byzantine garb all seem to be variations on
long tunics with overtunics -- nothing in two pieces, and if I
remember rightly, nothing with a plunging neckline.  How did these
women nurse in period?  I am willing to step out of persona
(embryonic tho mine is -- I just know that Katherine is from
Constantinople, of a family of cloth merchants, from the twelfth
century or so, Greek Christian) but I don't know where to start
for garb that will suit my need.  Also, I need for any type of
garb to be made between now and Pennsic to be easy to make.
Any suggestions out there?
As to the persona question discussed lately, I'm still a bit
puzzled.  How can anyone function without even the bare bones of
a persona?  After all, most names that are registerable must come
from somewhere.  And when it comes to choice of garb, it would
seem that a person would have to make some kind of choice as to
region and century for styles and colors.  As I noted above, I'm
not very far along in my persona research, but I am looking forward
to learning more about my era and city to know just what my
persona would be likely to do and think.  And if I'm married
to a toymaker's apprentice of uncertain origin, so be it!

Subject: Plague at the First Ducal Challenge

Unto the folk of the Rialto does Lady Elizabeth Wolfe send greetings!

Since I have yet to see any mention of this here, I thought I'd better post
something.

A number of us went to the first Ducal Challenge in Pennsylvania this past
weekend.  On the way home Sunday, I started feeling really sick.  Two hours
after I got home I got about as sick as I have ever been.  Over the next 24
hours all six of us began exhibiting varying degrees of the same symptoms. 
None of us felt like we had a flu; we all just felt very stomach-sick. 
Consequently we thought perhaps we'd eaten something we shouldn't have on the
trip home, but we couldn't come up with anything we had all eaten.  Then people
who had gone to the event but hadn't driven home with us turned up sick.  So
our next thought was that at the event we had all gotten food poisoning which
somehow had a 24-hour delay, or more if the victim's constitution was good.  I
called the autocrat last night, thinking that if something like that had really
happened he surely was getting other calls and would be wanting to know about
every person affected.

Lord Cahan Kyle was indeed aware of the problem and had some answers for me. 
The history of this plague went something like this (kind of shaky
reconstruction; I wasn't feeling too good when I spoke with him):

Two merchants came to the event knowing they were just getting over being sick. 
A third merchant had to leave the event during the day (Saturday?) because of a
worsening ailment.  Sunday after leaving the event a number of people became
ill; nearly all of them suspected food poisoning on the trip home or at the
event.  Some of these called Lord Kyle in case it originated at the event.  He,
being an EMT and the autocrat, was very distressed at the possibilities and
looked into it at once.  Here are the results of his investigations:

IT'S NOT FOOD POISONING.  Both on- and off-board people got it.  Also, the only
item at the feast which could have had a 24-hour lag time in the showing of
symptoms was the mushrooms, and people who didn't eat mushrooms got sick
(including me); in any case, that kind of food poisoning would have been
nowhere near as severe as what people experienced.  If it had been the chicken,
symptoms would have been shown in 4-6 hours.  (Caveat:  I don't know anything
medical.  I'm repeating, to the best of my recollection, what I was told. 
Hopefully I'm not getting any technical details wrong.)

IT'S NOT SOMETHING IN THE WATER.  The water is untreated well-type water, but
people who have drunk that water all their lives (the camp owner's son) got the
plague, so it isn't something present in the water that non-natives reacted
badly to.  It's also not due to a non-normal substance in the water:  people
who didn't drink the water got sick, and people who did drink it sometimes
didn't.  Also, since the facility is commercial, its water is tested every
month by state law just in case of contaminants.  It was tested Wednesday
before the event and was fine.

IT'S A VIRUS!  The camp owners took their son to the doctor, who said that it's
a nasty intestinal virus.  Another person who got it went to the doctor (in New
Jersey?) and got the same diagnosis.  Investigation along these lines turned up
the merchants who had been sick before coming to the event.  Twenty-one people
have been reported to the autocrat as having it so far.  IT IS APPARENTLY VERY
COMMUNICABLE.  IF YOU HAVE IT, STAY AWAY FROM EVERYONE!!

The symptoms of the virus may include any of the following:

o Nausea for about 4 hours, followed by severe vomiting lasting up to 12 hours.
  Diarrhea for the duration of the vomiting.  These don't appear to taper off;
  they stop very suddenly.
o Chills and fever-type aches with no measurable fever, or alternating hot/cold
  flashes.  Inability to lie still while trying to sleep due to the aches;
  kicking and thrashing wildly in sleep.
o After the vomiting stops, the fever aches continue another day or so
  accompanied sometimes by a headache, random stabs of pain in the body,
  dizziness, and an oddly heightened sense of smell.
o Feeling of fullness with no desire to eat for days afterward (I haven't
  really eaten yet).

We found that even though we didn't want to eat, it seemed to help if we ate a
little bit.  Sometimes the nausea reappears upon eating.  If we ate only small
amounts (but frequently) it helped the aches go away.  Drinking lots of liquids
(especially good old gatorade) helped too.

IF YOU GOT THIS, or know someone who went to the Ducal Challenge and got it,
call the autocrat and let him know.  He has to put together a report for the
Kingdom Chiurgeon.

Subject: 'persona' booklets

Good gentles of the Rialto, greetings!
    Reverting back to the original note about the booklets, (and
I'm afraid I have to trust my memory here..) they were for the guidance
of new SCAites, and were to have scads of useful background info' already
broken down by time, and region. The guidance for persona development was
only _part_ of the whole. I think that the project would be very
useful, but maybe, in view of the persona arguments, instead of the
fictional characters mentioned (or maybe as _well_ as ?), a few select
'potted' biographies of real people (if any are known) could be provided,
and perhaps a recommended reading list?
    These are just thoughts, but I'm only a new kid here myself, so I'm
not qualified to contribute to any of the booklets. I am however _deeply_
impressed by the depth and breadth of the local fisher's knowledge, and
I think something like the booklets would be a marvellous way of spreading
it, and giving newbies (like me :) ) a good grounding in our chosen area/s
of interest.
  I don't want to take sides in the pro/anti/ persona debate. I haven't
_any_ experience of either, so my opinion there is invalid. I didn't
want such a good idea to founder because a part of it was taking on such
importance, and I can't recall seeing other notes backing it.

Subject: We really don't bite . . .

It has been brought to my attention that some of the discussions here 
are a bit unnerving to some of the newer folk in the Society.  As a 
result I'm posting this to reassure anyone who is at risk of being 
"scared off" by what they read.

What you are seeing in this forum is--in many instances--people who 
have been in the Society for many years arguing about fine points.  
There really aren't any "Authenticity Police"--that's a characature to 
drive home a point.  Newcomers *aren't* expected to be up on all the 
details of cosutming, behaviour, social etiquette, and who all the 
"brass hats" are and what perks are due them.  If *anybody* gets upset 
over some perceived failing of a new arrival within our ranks--they 
owe it to the new person to *quietly* explain the problem and not 
create a public display.  The later course would be discouteous--and 
doubly so in the case of somebody who has been around long enough that 
they ought to know better.

*If* you are nervous about going to any Society function because of 
what you've read here--don't be.  If you are unsure about what to wear 
to any sort of SCA get-together, call an official of the branch in 
question.  If there is a Chatellaine--call that person.  If you don't 
know who to call--call the Seneschal.  If you don't know who the 
Seneschal is--call the kingdom Seneschal.  If you don't know who 
*that* is--ask here and someone will mail you the information.  (I 
make a habit of at least *trying* to mail that much data, together 
with Registry information to all requests I see posted.  It's led to 
some very nice correspondences.)  It is a duty of all Seneschals to 
run their branch--and that includes helping newcomers.

I cannot presume to speak for all areas (or even all of the 
Principality of the Mists), but the areas I have had contact with are 
pretty informal when it comes to local meetings and practices.  If you 
are anywhere in or near the San Francisco Bay Area--BART practice 
(west end of the Rockridge BART station, Tuesdays and Thursdays from 
about 7 pm to 10 pm) is a good place to meet people.  Nobody wears 
garb--so you don't need to worry about that.  A lot of non-fighters 
hang around and chat.  If you are looking for someone in particular--
ask.

If any of you can't get questions answered--send e-mail to *me*, and 
I'll try to get the information you need (or at least, point you in 
the right direction).  In any case--don't worry about what you read 
here--it will make a lot more sense and seem a lot less threatening 
after you've been around the SCA a while.

Subject: Heralds

Greetings!

I liked Duke Vissewald's account of medieval tournaments. It seems indeed
that the SCA type of tournament has been molded more on Hollywood than on
reality. The closest we ever get to a medieval tournament is probably our
wars. In spite of this, our tournaments are fun and give us cause to
practise that romantic type of chivalry which we all love, wether it's
authentic or not. In fact, we often have more fun when we play Hollywood
than we do when we try to be authentic... but this is heresy and I will
shut up.

According to Sir Anthony Richard Wagner, the original function of medieval
Heralds was to conduct tournaments. He elaborates on this in "Heralds and
Heraldry in the Middle Ages - an inquiry into the Growth of the Armorial
Function of Heralds" (Oxford 1956), a book that should be of great interest
to every SCA herald with any curiosity about the origins of his office.

Here are some interesting items from that book:

-All early (12-13th century) mentions of heralds link them closely with
 tournaments.
-Heralds would ride out and proclaim tournaments a week or so before.
-Heralds would precede or accompany their lords to the joust. Guillaume
 de Dole is said to have brought 200! 
-Heralds proclaimed the name of each combatant at his entry. They also
 cheered the combatants during the fighting.
-They were expected to know the name and country of each knight, and
 their most famous deeds. They attended the ladies who were watching.
-Outside the jousting, they acted as counsellors and masters of ceremonies
 to their lords.
-Heralds roused the company of knights in time for church on the morning
 of the tournament.

Juridical matters pertaining to rights of arms were judged by the Constable
and the Marshal - i.e. by a court of chivalry. Heralds do not appear to have
had any function in respect to who was entitled to bear arms, or the design
of arms. In 1395 there is a mention of two heralds being called in as expert
witnesses at a trial concerning arms.

In early times, heralds and minstrels are closely linked, as colleagues or
as rivals. In records of payment heralds and minstrels were sometimes
bunched together. Evidently, some people were both minstrels, jongleurs
and heralds!

The English laws for the conduct of tournaments from 1292 forbade heralds
to carry any arms save pointless swords.

Henri de Laon is known as the author of a satirical poem, the "Dit des
Hyraus", consisting mainly of abuse of the heralds. Tournaments, he
complains, have become professionalized. Jousters are only interested in
winning prizes, instead of proving their prowess. Tournaments now resemble
parliaments, and soon advocates will be wanted to appeal against the sun or
the weapons... They last so long that poor knights are ruined and can no
longer compete, nor can they approach the great lords on account of the
size of their retinues. Every knight has to maintain 3 or 4 heralds and
cannot get rid of them. There is no profession more convenient for an
idle, greedy man, nor any in which one may talk so much and do so little.

Edward I was the first English king to maintain heralds, and in his reign
the rolls of arms begin to appear. It is possible but not certain that some
of these rolls were the work of heralds. The low artistic quality of most
early rolls suggests that they were not the work of scribes.

During the reign of Edward III the office of Herald developed further -
they were now given diplomatic and military responsibilities. The first
documented example of an English herald as a messenger of war: Monday 13
April 1338, Carlisle Herald brings a message to Edward III from the lords
of Gascony.

It is also at this time that the various names of heraldic offices appear,
such as "Norroy King of Arms". It seems that "King of Arms" means "leader
of the heralds" in a certain area (called March).

It is in the 15th century that heralds become the arbiters of heraldry,
instead of the Constable and the Marshal. This development is carried
further in the 16th century when heralds begin to make "visitations" to
check on the noble status and rights of arms of the gentry.

Gosh, this is getting long! I'd better finish here.

    I didn't call them Mavins, I called them Nazis. And it just wasn't a flame

just happened to be the focus this time around.

     I do find it interesting Justin, that my word is being questioned here,
that it should be inferred that somehow I'm just "not with the program" 
because your experiences have led you to different conclusions. Yes, I know
people that are rude and abusive to other people because they don't conform
to some idea of how the SCA should be run. I have seen it in person, 
had it communicated by letter and seen it in action here on the Rialto. Now,
I'm sure that my perceptions as far as the Rialto go are reactionary and 
mostly due to cultural bias, however I am aware that others I have spoken
with, both lurkers and non-lurkers here are drawing similar perceptions
so I can't be too far off.

>The East is theoretically one of the homes for Wayward Authenticity Police, 
>and I haven't yet met anyone who comes close to this Persona Nazi you decry.

     Then consider yourself lucky. I had three my first event. I had two
more my second and even collected a third later on that evening. My third
event one tried to 'rescue me' from the local group so that I'd be '
indoctrinated into the SCA in the right way.' I have spoken to other people
who have had similar experiences both in and out of the West.

     Yet.....in her first article here she said that she couldn't imagine
how anyone justified their existence in the SCA without a persona. Then
asked questions surrounding that issue, 'Who are these people?' 'How do they
do events?' etc. Mind now, I let this sit for a week before I replied and
that was only after talking with a cross section of people I know who are
either lurkers or posters and *they* got the same impression.

     They do and they are as likely to make contact with the newcomer, (I
personally find the term "newbie" offensive and don't use it), as someone
with a more relaxed attitude. The reason I stayed with the SCA was because
I had a wonderful support group of individuals who would hardly be considered
"mainstream" SCA, who, upon hearing my tales of the encounters laughed and 
told me "not to worry about it." I know of others who weren't so fortunate
and actively dislike the SCA based on their encounters with either a single
individual or a group of individuals like the stereotypes I exemplified in
the post.

Best,

Lord Arron Reynard

	I helped run Pennsic Security this past year and the only problems
that seemed to arise were between people that camped together and were
"friends".  We had things ranging from stress being relieved in shouting to
something that is best described as "Domestic Violence".  As to any
type of random assault, you are probably safer at Pennsic than at home.  The
numbers of individuals who are willing to defend someone in trouble with
bared steel is enough of a deterent for even the most foolish gang. So yes,
as many people have already stated, Pennsic is a safe place, as long
as you aren't afraid of fire hazards (I was the security person who found
a burning tent this past year, how exciting :-(  ).

	My question about this gentle is, does he carry all of these weapons
on the field or just for inspection?  Comar, Prince of the Middle Kingdom,
typically enters the field battle and woods battle at Pennsic with at least
five weapons; a spear, two swords dangling from thongs on his wrists, and
two swords hanging from his belt as spares.  He also carries a shield with
a shoulder strap to allow it to be slung over the back.  I have seen Comar
go through all of his weapons on at least one occasion and end up scrounging
the "dead" for their now unused weapons.  He ends up dropping the spear when
the lines break, and ends up breaking his swords when blocking powerful two
handed sword blows.  Of course I ended up borrowing a sword one year in the
woods, when I lost my shield (two-sword is better than single-sword-no-
shield after all).

Oh the joys of heavy infantry and the Middle Marches...

 Your subject line seems to indicate that you feel this as a _threat_, that
someone who is not engaged in "persona-building" is therefore an adversary.
I suspect that coming from me, such an attitude would be called "paranoid".
Really, They are not out to Get you, or stop you from doing what pleases

Subject: personae

Along the lines that some others have recently posted, I, too, have
a slightly different view of personae than is being flamed.  At least,
I hope it's a different view.  I've always understood persona to mean
the part you play - King, Pelican, herald, mid-11th C., pre 17th C., 1326 AD,
Scot, German, Northern European, ...  I know people who chose to live
that persona in mundane life, as well - that's the part they play all the
time.  I have a Scarborough Faire (the Waxahachie - S of Dallas - Ren
Fair - that starts up this weekend if you're in the area) who lapses in
and out of persona on a semi-regular basis.  Oops, I left out the word
"friend" - please insert appropriately.

I was very surprised by the view of persona as this complex personal history
that is trotted out for display to total strangers as a sign of research
ability and interests.  Anyone else?  Or am I in a minority?

It is in fact very strong in Ansteorra, particularly in the south, although
it's getting stronger in the whole kingdom all of the time.  Being from
Bryn Gwlad (Austin, TX), I couldn't imagine the SCA without both heavy
weapons and rapier combat!

There were, for those who may be interested, 87 people in the most recent
Queen's, which happened a few weeks ago.  The tournament ran on four fields
for most of its rounds.

This is more like our "largest average" tournament size, too.  Queen's tends
to draw people from all over the kingdom (and out of the woodwork, too).  Of
course, that just means there are more people you've never fought before in
the list... and lots of people (including me) think that's a really neat
opportunity!

[quote deleted]

	"What do we actually model in a tournament?"  Off the cuff,
the Victorian Ideal of the Chivalric Pas de Arms.  Certainly, with a 
few exceptions, our tourney's, particularly our Crown Tourney's, have
nothing to do with period tourney's that I've read about.  Our wars
are better at simulating medieval combat than our tourney's are at
reproducing theirs!!  (And that should say a lot...)  

	There are exceptions.  The Tournament of Lions, in Ansteorra,
is one, and the final round, as I understand it, of the Ducal Challenge
series here in the East, sounds like it will do so as well.  But certainly
what seems to be the mainstay of the SCA tourney, the good ole' double elim,
doesn't seem to have anything to do with any form of combat in the middle
ages.  The closest that you generally see is the occational ransom
tourney.


)Pretty rough stuff, and not very much like what we do. Later, things became 
)more organised, but apparently no less dangerous. Henry II of France was

)Furthermore, though dangerous, I get the impression that tournaments were not
)as important in medieval times as they are for us. Participation in tournament
)was a step on the path to chivalric perfection, not an end in itself.

	The impression that I got from a modern book on William Marshall
("William Marshall: The Flower of Chivalry"??  I think, I gave it to a
new fighter a few years ago, and haven't replaced it.) was that the 
tourney was fairly important.  An example that I recall (and possibly
missrecall) was that at one point William was banished by the king,
but that everyone was certain that the banishment would be lifted before
the tourney season started, emphasizing both the importance of the
tourney and how important a single individual could be in what was, at
that time, basically a team affair.  There were also notes in there about
the violence of the tourney, where you captured someone by clubing them
senseless.  

	 
)This leads me to the conclusion that a core experience of SCA life, the 
)tournament, is a very poor distortion of what happened in the medieval world.

)Tom Courtney

	A reasonable question, at this point, would be "Was Chivalry?"
I've never seen much more than just lip service given to the idea of
chivalry in period contests.  (Maldon (?) being one of the more bizarre
exceptions.)  To that extent, we are, and have been since the beginning,
devoted, not to the recreation of the middle ages as they were, but to
to recreation of the chivalric ideal that exists in the some of the
literature of the time.  Our tournaments, while generally faithful to this
idea, are generally simply courtious sporting events.  I'm not terribly
enthusiastic about this either...

Subject: persona, a definition

Greetings!

Here are some excepts from a letter I wrote to Aristorm the Golden, 
which may be of interest to the Rialto.

Perhaps we are using the word "persona" to mean different things.  To
me, the "persona" that I developed in the East consists of every part
of "Iulstan Sigewealding" that is not real (born in 557 in Jutland,
speaks Northwest Germanic, believes in magic, fearful of strangers,
knowledgeable about domestic animals, etc.).  Since I came to the West,
these things have become less and less important to me.  The important
things, I think, are the real things (granted Arms by the Prince of the
Mists, made tunics and trousers, organized announcements at October
Crown, autocratted a feast, created scrolls from scratch, knowledgeable
about heraldry and sixteenth-century dance, etc.)

I am not an actor, and my ability to "keep up a persona" at events,
especially when the people around me are not, is not great.  Besides,
if I were to really play Iulstan to the hilt, I'd not be able to
dance or herald at events.  In fact, I'd probably be too afraid to 
even make friends with new people.  If I were really doing it right,
I'd not be able to wear my glasses or even speak English at events.  
Obviously, nowhere in the world is persona practiced to this extent,
and I'm exaggerating the problems, but I hope you will see my point.

I have to agree. Ice hockey is fairly popular in Sweden, and hockey gloves are
the most common form of hand protection here. Both of the two people I know 
that has broken a hand in SCA fighting was wearing hockey gloves. One broke the
bone over the little finger and one broke the thumb. There's a lot of people 
here that uses basket hilts and a few that uses gauntlets, these seem to 
provide much better protection. However, some use have been made of reinforced
hockey gloves, and wereas these are probably even uglier than the original 
(they usually feature heavy leather held in place with duct tape...) we havent
had any severe problems with these.

Subject: Personas

Greetings to the Rialto, from Baroness Jessa d'Avondale.

I did not have a "persona" immediately upon joining the SCA, apart
from "wearing pre-17th century garb, and acting as a lady of the period"
(from the SCA Articles of Incorporation).  And I think that that is
a sufficient persona for new members.  After a year or two, I picked my
name, and after experimenting with various styles of garb, and finding
out more about history, I have settled in the Italian Renaissance.
(wishing I had started with a name that was more obviously Italian...)

However, I find that my persona at events is more along the lines of
castellan of a ducal household, or more recently, head lady-in-waiting
to the Queen.  

In the same way that many SCAdians wince when "the SCA" in mentioned in
court, Persona is just something you *are*, and not something you discuss.
A gentleman I had just met at a ball, trying to strike up some conversation,
asked me "So, what's your persona?"  (Gee, maybe I should have just said,
"I'm a Scorpio"..... :-)

I am submitting this posting through Lady Calista's I.D.
     I had to spend over $1,000.00 to have
a bone graph done on the index finger of my left hand.
I was wearing Hockey Gloves.  I am not a small person.  I am at
least 6ft and 205lbs.  The incident occured when I was delivery a blow from
a polearm at close range.  My opponent was also throwing a blow.  My index
finger was caught between the hafts.  The injury was serious enough that
the doctors had to take a piece of my hip and reconstruct the bone nearest
the hand.  Since then I have had harder blows land on my hands (great swords)
and have greatly appreciated my PLATE Gauntlets.  I have never been one to
criticize a person for not "looking period", but Hockey Gloves defintly are
not period looking.  They can be supplemented by heavy leather or metal
plates.  Either of these makes them safer and more appealing.  If anyone
who reads this needs patterns for Plate Gauntlets... please send a message
to Lady Calista's account (Karin Grow).  I would be quite glad to mail you
what we have.  I am concerned what would happen to people who have a small
bone structure and try blocking greatsword shots (or just plain hard shots)
with a Hockey Glove.  I implore those people who don't want hand injuries
to get something better than Hockey Gloves.

I could make an Engineer out of you!  (Please look at the change in
population for Ansteorra . . .)  No--I don't think it's significant.
Outlands has a history of shaky growth and I expect this will turn around
in the months ahead.  Atenveldt had a rough strt as a kingdom these many
years ago and I expect growth later.  The much more alarming (and I imagine--
reversible) problem is the drop in membership in New Zealand--the foreign
branch of Caid.  They've gone from 15 at the end of '89 to 11 at the end
of March.

  I have never used specifically hockey gloves, but I have been using a
comparable equivalent for over three years now, lacrosse gloves.  And, I have
been fighting katana *almost exclusively* (95+% of tourney combat, 85+% of
melee combat) for the past three years.  My experience has been that, if you're
VERY good, or if you don't care at all about broken and/or battered digits,
you can get away with using hockey/lacrosse gloves, for fighting katana or
bastard sword.  Glaive of any sort, and spear except for the bridge battle at
Pennsic, is stupid unless you have some very rigid protection over your hands
(Since I am a pianist and a computer programmer, I need to keep my fingers in
fairly good working order).  It took me a while to realize this, but eventually
I got the hint, and went to my local armorer and just fitted three plates of
16-gauge steel over the tops of my lacrosse gloves, to get the general effect
of real gauntlets (which I presently have on order).  Before I did this,
and especially before I got to the point of being able to get fairly far in
tourneys with katana, I would usually get *at least* one or two mashed fingers
per event or fighting practice. I would hate to think what my hands would be
like if I'd insisted on fighting naginata in tourneys without rigid protection
of some sort.  I don't know what individual kingdom laws are governing such
things (I know that hockey and lacrosse are specifically mentioned as being
legal in the East), and I wouldn't want to see more stringent requirements
placed on armor, but I would *strongly suggest* to anyone considering learning
single-sword or polearm to either due LOTS (i.e. months) of very slow slow-work
or wear at least hockey gloves with plastic or steel plates on top.  This is
the voice of much experience, and while the individual injuries may not be that
serious (though broken fingers are quite a real possibility), in the long run
you will do serious har, to your hands, for the rest of your life (which will

the answer to my riddle

What has a spine but no back
and speaks a thousand words without a mouth

is indeed a book.

As one good gentle pointed out, a book has a back and a front. Perhaps, I shall
riddle some more.  With a little better form.

Subject: Re: loyalties (semi-long)

I've noticed in the BMDL, (I don't know much about the rest of the East)
that how someone gets treated when they come from another area (kingdom,
shire, etc.) depends on what they do and say and how they do/say it.  I
know one person who is alway saying how 'kingdom' did this better and
that better.  She generally gets resented for it and is not considered
part of our group because SHE first has never considered herself part of
our group.

I know two other people who have recently come to the BMDL who are very
helpful.  Elsbeth Anne Roth from the West and Caid and Mistress Rayah,
(a Laurel) from the Middle.  These two people may point out differences
between their previous kingdom and the East, but they never put down the
East just because it is different.  They are also willing to share the
knowledge that they have learned in another land.  I have gone from being
a field herald only to being fairly knowledgable about good heraldry and
how to conflict check the letters of intent.  I couldn't of done this
without the help of Elsbeth and Myfawnway.  The three of us are now sharing
our combined knowledge with another newcomer (he's not nearly a newcomer
anymore) with 'learning the ropes'.  We, almost every barony meeting, invite
new people to come and join us.  That's how I think of the Society, as an
education center.  We're just not paying to learn what we do.  We do it for
enjoyment.

Likewise, with Mistress Rayah, she has apprentices, not only in the Middle.
She has helped the belly dancing group in our area without trying to take
it over.  When she takes an apprentice, she wants them to learn EVERYTHING
she knows and she also wants to learn something from them.  She admits that
she doesn't know everything and that she also can learn from people who don't
have Laurels.  (I think it's kind of obvious that I admire her a great deal.)
She is what I always want to think of as a Laurel.

As for loyalties, my persona, (or the one I am presently trying to develop)
wouldn't swear fealty to anyone except someone from her own tribe.  I in good
conscience can't swear fealty to anyone except maybe to say 'I swear that I
and my people shall not wrongly take the goods or people of your lands.'
I have loyalties that go beyond my historical persona into my SCA persona.
I am loyal to the College of Heralds, to do the best job researching and
commenting devices that I possibly can, and to be the best field herald that
I possibly can.  This is a loyalty that is totally SCA related and not period
related.

I also feel that I have loyalty to the SCA as a whole.  I am no longer a
newbie and I feel that I should begin the process of teaching others instead
of always just learning.  After all, this is an educational society as well
as a place where we dress and speak differently from the modern world.

I am loyal to both music groups in our barony for showing up 2 out of every
3 times. (Paraphrased from Robin the Just)

So just as someone thinks a persona can be SCA or historical or both.  I also
believe that loyalties can be the same way.

Note that if you include the December 1989 figures, the results for these
three kingdoms becomes--

               Dec. 89     Feb. 90    Mar. 90

Atenveldt        818         855        847
Caid            1514        1570       1559
Outlands         633         629        621

At this level, only Outlands has a declining population.  It is also
part of a very sparsely settled (in US terms) part of the country--you're
looking at New Mexico, parts of Colorado, aa small peice of Texas,
and Wyoming--not your areas with major cities.  The largest cities will
be El Paso, Albequerque, and Denver.  They also have Santa Fe.

It's something of a wonder that there are enough SCA folk in the area
to support a kingdom at all.  Let us see what the statistics look like
at the end of the year . . .

Subject: Fool's War scores

Greetings!

Until such time as I get around to commenting on some of the topics currently 
under discussion, pray let me give a brief account of the results of last 
weekend's annual Fool's War (3-way war between Trimaris, Meridies, and 
Atlantia).  The following were related to me by my roommate, Mistress Warjna, 
who attended the war, and who wishes to make a disclaimer in the event her
memory proves faulty. 

In the Arts and Sciences competition, Meridies and Atlantia scored 57 and 63 
war points (she couldn't remember which Kingdom got which score), and Trimaris 
scored 257 war points*.  In battle, Meridies or Atlantia won the beach battle 
(again, Mistress Warjna couldn't remember which one) and Trimaris won the 
other battles.

Vivat Trimaris!


*101 of these points were scored by my Barony, An Crosaire-- which means if An 
Crosaire were a Kingdom, we'd have placed second!**

**Okay, okay, so I'm boasting a little...  Do you *really* blame me?  :-)


                                In Service,

Subject: fashion plates

Unto Lord Arron Reynard in particular,

Being a fashion plate (hmm... potential pun) in the lists
is not a requirement, but, not being an eyesore in the lists
is a courtesy that we should make some attempt to afford to
those who watch us.

At the coronation of Horic there was a gentle fighting in the 
tourney whose armor appeared to be held to his body solely by
duct tape.  On a new fighter who is still working out his armor
this is understandable.  Unfortunately this fellow's armor was
covered with the shredded remanents of the tape that was used
the last umpteen times it had been worn.  He wore no tabard.
This gentle's appearance in the list was an affront to me (and
others) not because he wasn't a fashion plate from the middle
ages but because his armor was actively ugly regardless of
your aesthetic viewpoint.

Opinionatedly Yours,
Frydheric Eysenkopf

Born in Muslim North Africa. As a teenager, accompanied his uncle, who was a

In further reponse to Arval's question about GEnie, and in amplification of
Nagaseru Otaka Kobara's response:  I am not a sysop on GEnie, but I am an
active patron of the SCA category in the BBS section of the Science Fiction
and Fantasy Roundtable.  One of the issues I have raised is the great
desirability of GEnie establishing an Internet gateway.  Such a gateway
already exists from CompuServe, and it adds a good many names to the Rolls
Ethereal.  It was, in fact, my only entry to the Rialto until I finally got
uucp running on my system.

It is not yet possible to forward messages directly to people on GEnie, but
I too can act as liason if need be.

In the meantime, I will keep urging GEnie management to add the gateway as
soon as possible.

If anyone wants to help in the campaign, or just wants more info on GEnie,
please send mail.

Re: Hal's Projections

It continues to scare me; we are right on track for meeting the estimates
of Yosef Alaric's "There We Were" series in terms of both size and
complexity. The mind boggles to think about what Pennsic might actually be
like in another decade...


Re: Persona

Arron sent in a long, rather exasperated-sounding flame about Persona
Mavins, managing to make it sound like there are people all over the Society
whose purpose in life is to make everyone conform to some arbitrary ideal
of the SCA that includes having an elaborate persona story.

I'm really curious: Arron, do you actually know *anyone* who fits your
description? I think you've created a bit of a straw-man argument here. The
East is theoretically one of the homes for Wayward Authenticity Police, and
I haven't yet met anyone who comes close to this Persona Nazi you decry.
Indeed, I spent a good five years before I had more persona than a name
(I hadn't even pinned down my general era), and no one *ever* gave me
any trouble about it. You're clearly coming off of Arastorm's posting on
the subject, and I will admit that her post was a little provincial (and
a bit intellectually arrogant), but even she has never, to my knowledge,
committed the sin of "nudge, nudge, wink, wink". (I used to hang around
her household in my early days, and never got the slightest hassle...)

Yes, there are people who craft elaborate persona stories, who will happily
sit you down and regale you with something that is virtually a fairy tale
for half-an-hour if you show the slightest interest. In my experience,
though, there aren't many such people -- the ones that there are simply
stand out in one's memory. And none such has ever shown the slightest
disrespect because I didn't have a similarly elaborate persona. (Indeed,
I don't think any have ever shown much interest in reciprocating stories.
There's something a tetch Narcissistic about regaling someone with your
persona story while at an event...) There are a few folk with "Cuisinart
personae" (wonderful metaphor -- I'll have to remember it), who want to
fit every interest and every relationship into their persona, but I've
never seen one who proselytized...

My concern is basically whether such people as you describe actually
exist. I certainly agree that these Persona Nazis would deserve to be
stomped a bit if they were real, but I'm not convinced that they are.
Are you seeing real people here, or are you creating a convenience
to attack? Strawmen make for nice rhetoric, but lousy reasoning...


Re: Escorts at Pennsic

LaMaia asks whether people think that she should always be escorted at
Pennsic. Personally, I'm aghast that the question needs to be asked. I
think of Pennsic as one of the safest places I know, one of the few where
I have never worried about wandering around in the dead of night. Have
things really degenerated to the point where we have to worry? Does anyone
have any statistics to back up or shoot down this worry?

The major problem with this angle is that you cannot decline a fight in a
tournament. This method only holds for practices, warm-ups, and post-tourney
pick up fights. We will not be able to make the undying fighter think about his
methods if he is continually reinforced by winning every tourney he
participates in.  What did Thomas Moore's silence get him besides beheaded?

Subject: The Rolls Ethereal

Well, there seems to be a building hue-and-cry for a new edition of the
Rolls. Since I haven't had time to organize the census yet (which would
take a bit of time), and there seem to be an awful lot of people who
really want a new edition out soon, I'm inclined to procrastinate on the
census until the next edition, and get a new one out sooner...

Therefore, I am now putting out the usual Final Call for Entries for
the Rolls. If you have not previously sent me an entry, or if you have new
corrections to your entry, send them to me now; I'll close the books in
about three weeks, and go to press toward the end of May. Anything that
gets to me after the books close misses going in this edition, so send
me your info today...

Also, I'd like all those who maintain the Rolls on FTP'able sites to
please send me the relevant FTP information -- I'd like to have a coherent
list of FTP sites on hand...

For those who are new: the Rolls Ethereal are the "Domesday Boke" for
the Rialto, a listing of all SCAdians on the Net who wish to be listed.
("The Net", in this context, means anything that can talk to the Internet,
including: Internet, UUCPnet, Fidonet, BITNET, Compuserve, MCIMail,
and probably several others that I'm forgetting. If you're reading this
electronically, you're almost certainly on the Net.) You don't have to
enter the Rolls, but if you plan on communicating with other SCAdians
over the Net, it can be quite convenient. The following is excerpted 
from the introduction to the Rolls, and describes how to enter them...

How to get into these Rolls
 --------------------------

Those who want to be listed should send the following information to the
Editor of the Rolls (currently Justin du Coeur, uunet!inmet!justin or
justin@inmet.inmet.com):

1) SCA Name
2) Mundane Name
3) SCA location (eg, Kingdom & Barony/Shire)
4) Mundane location (eg, city and state)
5) Titles & offices, if any
6) Interests
7) Net address

Some comments on the fields:

-- The only information that *must* be sent for inclusion is an SCA or
   Mundane name, and Net address. All other fields are optional (most
   people supply them, but for the privacy concious...) If you don't
   have an SCA name yet, but consider yourself a SCAdian, that's fine;
   just say so, and send an update as soon as you come up with an
   SCA name; in the meantime, you'll be listed under the Mundane name.

-- Please keep the data short. There is only one line available for Titles
   & Offices. If you have been in the Society for twenty years, and have
   accumulated dozens of titles, you can probably consider yourself an
   honored member of the Order of the Etc. Titles or Offices that you are
   particularly proud of should be listed *first*; if I have to trim the
   line, I give preference to things in the front. Likewise, there is
   only one line for Interests. If you are a Jack of All Trades, just say
   so. Particular interests should be listed first.

-- Don't make too many assumptions about my knowledge. Even if everyone
   in the Kingdom of New Oz knows and respects the Order of the Hippo as
   the highest award around, it's quite possible that I've never heard of
   it, so *don't* abbreviate it to "OHip" without explaining what that
   means.

-- Mundane location does not mean full street address. It is simply
   intended as a general locator, so that people can figure out literally
   where you're coming from. It isn't very obvious on the Net, and not
   everyone is proficient in converting SCA geography to Mundane.

-- For the Net address, Internet format (mumble@foobar.site.domain)
   is *strongly* preferred; this is fast becoming a world-wide standard,
   and is a lot more compact than giving the entire linkage tree from the
   backbone. If you *must* give a bang-address (...x!y!foobar!mumble),
   choose *one* best path, and list that. Again, I'm trying to keep this
   down to one line (thus saving me some typing). Also, remember to
   specify which Net you're on; "mumble@foobar" could be Usenet, BITNET,
   or an abbreviated Internet address.

Also, note that, if you want to be included, be sure to send this information
to *me*. If it is sent to sca-request, it may or may not get in, and if it is
sent to The Rialto, it almost certainly won't. This applies to changes just
as much as to new entries; if you want your changes reflected in the Rolls,
be sure to tell me.

[...]

Multiple Entries
----------------

I have received a number of "care of" entries for the Rolls, where someone
not on the Net is receiving e-mail via someone who is. At the moment, I
am still accepting these, but I ask that this not be abused. *Don't*
send your entire group's names for entry under your address. It's fine
(for now, at least) to send your spouse's or Seneschal's entry c/o you,
but try to keep it down. The Rolls are getting quite large, and if this
gets abused too much, I'll have to cut out c/o entries entirely.

Likewise, I have received several "lists" of people on the Net, where one
member of a group sends information for everyone remotely connected to
the group. I believe that a lot of the members so listed are rather
peripheral, in the SCA or the Net or both. Therefore, I ask that people
send their own entries to me. It's fine to send information for a close
friend while you're doing your own, but any message containing more than
three entries risks being thrown out entirely. I'm sorry I have to do this,
but the only way that I can tell that someone actually cares about having
an entry is having them send it themselves, and it's no fun at all entering
the data for twenty people, suspecting that most of them aren't even active
SCAdians...

Accuracy
--------

There are no warrantees, express or implied, on this information. I'm 
printing it as I got it, this edition, and have made no attempts to
confirm that the Net addresses are currently valid. If your information
is incorrect, or you know *for sure* that someone else's is, send a
correction to me (justin@inmet.inmet.com).

Observations on some recent topics:

Women fighters: I was told a story, long ago and far away, about a woman
who wished to be a fighter. She succeeded in authorizing, in spite of the 
prevalent attitude discouraging it. One of the ways that people were 
attempting to discourage this was in coming up with nitpicking applications 
of rules. One marshal, on inspecting her and her armor, informed her she
could not fight because she did not have an athletic supporting cup. He 
made the mistake of doing this in public; she responded, loudly, "Oh? Should
I wear it on my shoulder as my lord's favor?"

I cannot swear to the veracity of this; if it is apocryphal, it certainly
*should* have happened!

I recently read Patricia Kennealy's "Kelts in Space" fantasy trilogy. (I 
dont remember the titles... and they are referred to as such in one of the
author's forwards.) In the bio at the back she is listed as being in the 
SCA, in what I believe would be Ostgardr. I could be wrong about the SCA
group, not being familiar with the NYC area in the SCA sense. 

_The_Gryphon_King_ was written by Tom Dietz, set in Georgia. Part of the 
setting is a Rennaissance fair... I dont remember if it was put on by the 
local SCA in the book, or if they were just players at it. 

I distinctly remember a character named Sir Ander Poulson at the end of 
_Number_of_the_Beast_ by Robert Heinlein. (please, no RAH flames... ) The
end of that book was effectively a large party/convention, with mega 
quantities of in-jokes (most of which I didnt get till I started attending
conventions...).

Subject: re: Pennsic and Escorts

To LaMaia the Barefoot - Yes, you should have an escort at Pennsic.  Now,
before anyone says anything, let me qualify that.

Anyone wandering the encampment, particularly at night, should have someone
to wander with.  This doesn't need to be a bodyguard or a male companion
(in the case of ladies), but could be a friend to walk with, talk with, and
generally ensure companionship and insurance that someone knows where you
are and can get you home.  Many things can happen at Pennsic and it is
always good to have help and friendship (plus safety in numbers) to fall
back on, for whatever reason.  This isn't always necessary during the day
and can be waived for the high-density population areas during the early
evening hours. (I think I was sufficiently vague don't you?  I have heard
rumors of attacks and such but, they are just rumors to me, I have no
personal experience with which to speak).  Remember, you are talking an
encampment of close to 6000 people in vast amounts of land that are hilly,
wooded, and loaded with interesting snares for the unwary.

Now, children at Pennsic (and I mean anyone there under the age of
majority!) should be given strict rules about leaving the encampment at any
time day or night.  You should *always* let someone responsible know where
you are going, when you will return, and with who you will be with and you
should *never* go alone.  I haven't yet had the opportunity to take someone
to the War in this category, but when I do I plan on having a message board
outside the tent to relay messages on (so they don't have the excuse "well,
I tried but you weren't there!").  In fact, it isn't a bad idea for all the
adults in a camp to do the same!

I would like to do something this year I have always wanted to do... take
one or two other ladies and go shopping.........with three or four
sufficiently handsome men to tag along and carry our purchases for us.
Positions are available and suitable bribes, oops, I mean payment can be
negotiated.

Last I heard, Delaware was referred to as the "Unknown Lands" and had NO 
SCA groups in it, though I've met at least one person at an event who was 
from there (and annoyed that there was no place for her).  I've been told 
that yes, it would be in the East Kingdom, and that maybe Bhakail covers

I'm 5'8", weigh about 1.65 Ko, and am also female.  If Pennsic ever becomes 
a place where an escort is "required", I will not go.  Period.  I've wandered 
all over the camp at night, by myself, with never a problem.  Besides, should 
anything happen, help is just a yell away.  Of course, common sense like 
telling friends that you're going out for a walk is a good idea, in case of 
a turned ankle or something.

Unfortunately, our experiences do not agree.  Here in Myrkfaelen we
have a local award called the Order of the Red Roses.  It is given to
gentles who have had a diget broken while fighting.  In each of the
four cases, the victim was wearing hockey gloves.  A third of our
regulars use steel guantlets or basket hilts, and no one with steel
hand protection has had a finger broken.

One was a glaive -vs- sword sparing match where a pinkie was mashed
between the sword and the glaive haft.  In another case, the sword hand
was struck while in a high (or hanging) guard, during a melee.  I saw
this blow.  It was not excessivly hard, but it did strike downward onto
the inverted hand.  The other two cases were thumbs on the SHIELD hand.

The padding on hockey gloves is not rigid and does not extend arround
the sides of the fingers or hands.  While they may be suitable for
hockey (hence the name :-) ), they are not quite adequate for heavy
list.

Being a fashon plate is fun, and it does not hurt as much as you might
think.  I agree that it should not be a requirement, but it should be a
goal.  I know many fighters whose armour improved to the point where it
was 'good enough', and never got any better, or prettier.

Subject: personae

At the base of the "persona problem" seem to be two basic facts:

 - The SCA is different things to different people.
 - The SCA contains snobs.

Neither of these has much to do with persona in particular, and in fact the
problem occurs in other areas as well.  It's just that a "persona" of some
sort or other (even if it's just a name) is something we all "do," and so
conflicts can be more frequent sometimes.  However, people look down on
other people in the SCA for all sorts of reasons:

 - Scribes who look down on scrolls done on paper instead of vellum or
   parchment
 - Costumers who look down on garb that was sewn on a machine with trim
   instead of embroidery
 - Fighters who look down on armor that uses closed-cell foam or carpet
   instead of an authentic gambeson
 - Musicians who look down on modern versions of instruments that have
   been tuned to an even-tempered scale
 - Blacksmiths who look down on weapons made out of modern tool steel or
   stainless steel
 - Power vultures who look down on anyone who doesn't have a brass hat,
   and butter up anyone who does

And so on.  Not all "authenticity mavens" are snobs, and not all snobs are
"authenticity mavens."  Cariadoc, for example, doesn't seem to denigrate
anyone else's way of playing their game, he just has some specific goals
in mind that he works toward.  That's wonderful.  Trying to get 12,000+
other people to play exactly the same game as you are isn't--it's (a)
impractical, and (b) rude.

I am a bit confused why you would want to roll back armor standards.
Over the years the SCA has progressed in both the arts of combat and armouring.
They have complemented each other.... Yes we hit harder (with less effort) now
than in previous years, but the growing number of Armourers and their increasingskill has allowed us this progression while making combat SAFER.  Yes I do believe that combat is safer now than it was 11 years ago when I joined.  At that time Carpet and Freon Cans ruled the day.  Today suits of Brig and plate are common, and 10/12 gauge helms protect us from the rattan weapons - WHICH ARE THE SAME WEIGHT AND THICKNESS as they were 11 years ago.

When I see a person "clank around in fully functional plate armour" -- I am pleased.  I vastly perfer this to the person in carpet or plastic armour which we
pretend looks medieval.

Subject: Re: Persona booklets -- and stories

My Lords and Ladies--gently, please.  My orginal posting raising a 
caution flag was to note that "personas" (in the formal sense) are
*not* universal--or universally approved of--with the Laurel Kingdoms.
This was not an effort to condemn personas--but to remind the Gentle
that was solicting for authors that not everyone would applaud the
effort.  The basic idea--short works on the life and times of various
medieval places is an *excellent* idea.  To consider such works as
a handy giude for creating a persona (and so billing the works) is
what will cause problems--and I wished to avoid the the problems
that I thought sure to arise over that aspect of the project. 

All of this has been rather convincingly shown.

But I bid you tread carefully on others cherished dreams and ideals. 
One of the hallmarks of this Society needs to be *tolerance*.  Custom
and usage differ among the kingdoms--this is good.  Local custom should
not be seen as Universal Law--to do so is bad.

I admire those who can hold together a cnsistent persona.  I also
admire those who support the basic goals and beleifs of the SCA
without ever getting within arrow range of a persona.  A far greater
person in this Society than I will ever be has said that part of the
job of the Steward is to find the hero in every man.  That should be
true of us all.  Can you see the virtue in doing things differently
than you do?

In the West--that is *not* a legal move.

In a more genral vein--on the recent discussion of "Active Marshalling",

	Doing so without having lost either the arm or a rib or three
in the process isn't easy.  My opinions on the matter are somewhat
shaded by my origins.  In Ansteorra when I started, it was legal to
*grab* a blade for a count of two in tourney combat.  Fortunately,
few of us were fast enough to consider this a viable option...  But
we did tend to use an open hand to slap swords and other weapons out 
of line.

  I agree with Lord Thomas about the inability of hockey gloves to  safely
protect the fingers.  Hockey gloves were not meant to take the blows of
a rattan sword.  While it is true a glove can protect a blow to the top
of the fingers rather well (where you are most likely to get hit while
playing hockey) it does not protect the fingers from the angled blows of
SCA weapons.  Besides the finger problem there is also the laces problem.
Gettig hit on one of the little metal lace holes is not to friendly.  Even
though I am here telling the woes of the gloves I use them myself.  I fully
intend though to add on either plastic or metal protection for the fingers.
If anyone would have any suggestions as to how would go about this, it
would be greatly appreciated.
