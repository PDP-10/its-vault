This directory is used by the system for job devices.
When a request for a device named FOO is issued,
and the device is not one built into the system,
the program SYS:ATSIGN DEVICE looks on this directory
for a file called JOBDEV FOO; this file is presumed
to be a job device.  Do not reap files from this directory!
