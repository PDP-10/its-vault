.chapter Frames
Frames are windows that control the size and position of their inferiors.  They
provide the ability to easily create complicated window configurations.  Windows
that are inferior to frames, and that are controlled by the frames, are called panes.
Frames may also have inferiors that are not directly controlled by the frame, and
these will never be referred to as panes.

.section Flavors that apply to all frames

.defflavor tv:basic-frame
The flavor that should be included at the base of all frames.  It defines the
3tv:selected-pane* instance variable, and appropriate messages to handle selection
correctly [see (frame-selection)].  3tv:basic-frame* also defines the instance
variable 3tv:recursion*, which is looked at by the 3:inferior-expose*,
3:inferior-deexpose*, and 3:inferior-set-edges* methods to determine whether the
message transmission is an internal or external request.  This flavor does not
actually supply a non-noop definition of these messages, though Wrappers are defined
on 3:expose* and 3:deexpose* to bind 3tv:recursion* to 3t* so that individual
methods don't need to be concerned with this issue.  This flavor also redefines the
3:screen-manage-restore-area* method, to restore a set of rectangles on the frame
by restoring pieces of its inferiors if the frame does not have a 2bit-array*.
This allows much flexibility in determining where to put the bit arrays for a
particular application (either associated with the frame itself or on the individual
panes).
.end_defflavor

.defmessage :select-pane pane
Causes the 3selected-pane* to be set to 2pane*, which must be a pane of the frame.
Makes that pane the selected window now if the previously selected pane is the
selected window, and makes that pane the selected window any time a 3:select*
message is sent to the frame.
.end_defmessage

.defmessage :selected-pane
Returns the currently selected pane.
.end_defmessage

.defflavor tv:frame-pane-mixin
This flavor is used when the only windows inferior to a frame are panes that are
directly controlled by the frame itself.  It turns off most screen management for
the frame, and provides handlers for the 3:inferior-expose* and 3:inferior-deexpose*
messages.
.end_defflavor

.defmessage :inferior-expose inferior
This message is sent to the frame whenever a pane is sent an 3:expose* message, and
the pane includes the 3tv:pane-mixin* flavor.
If 3tv:recursion* is 3nil*, then an 3:expose*
message is sent to the frame, and afterwards 3nil* is returned.  Returning 3nil* informs
the caller that the message has been handled, and therefore the methods should not be run.
If 3tv:recursion* is non-3nil*, then 3t* is returned indicating to the pane that it
should perform its normal 3:expose* actions.  Since it is only legal to send a non-recursive
3:expose* message to an active pane, 2inferior* is checked against the list of active
inferiors, which is defined to be the list in the instance variable 3tv:exposed-inferiors*.
Therefore, sending a 3:expose* message to an active pane has the effect of exposing
the frame.
.end_defmessage

.defmessage :inferior-deexpose inferior
Same as 3:inferior-expose*, but for the 3:deexpose* message.
.end_defmessage
